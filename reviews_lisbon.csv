Sep 2017,40,Lovely Lisbon,A good comfortable hotel outside of the city center close to eateries and the zoo. A fabulous location so close to the station for both intercity and metro trains.A five star hotel in rating and does present well but the rooms are getting very tired and room service in particular was very patchy. Customer service though was excellent. Strange rules with the requirement to buy (8 euro!) ugly hair caps for the indoor pool ...not at all inviting.Some good cares and restaurants nearby but also very convenient to jump on the metro into town-warning many restaurants and cafes are not open on Sundays and Mondays...there is always the hotel restaurants although we didn't eat in these.
Sep 2017,30,a bit outside the city,PROS:beds very softtaxi stand right outsidegot nice view of the aquaducthas a safenice eating place with waterfalls and waterwaysCONS:located away from the city in the business districtbreakfast expensive ---- EUR 20 per person
Sep 2017,50,Great Hotel,"The customer service was excellent, the sleep quality also, and the breakfast was so rich and a lot of variety of food and drinks in it.we staid 6 days. it was a great eperience.the location is 10 mins from the downtown area.Staff are so friendly and they all speak english."
Sep 2017,50,Great hotel with nice rooms.,"Great hotel with all a warm and welcoming staff. The breakfast buffet was delicious and had options for everyone. This hotel is a little out of the way, but I can appreciate the distance from the busy downtown area. This hotel was right next to the metro, and had shops and restaurants within walking distance.  All in all a great stay."
Sep 2017,40,A hotel with a heart,"Our family of three stayed on our last leg of our trip to Portugal. This is a hotel that set the benchmark for the service a hotel should provide, which unfortunately is lacking in most of western europe. The staff and the service is catered keeping the guest in mind and not the hotel bottomline. The Check in was a breeze, and our room was on the 11th floor, looking over the aircraft pathway of lisbon airport, which never seizes to amaze. The Breakfast buffet spread was vast and very satisfying. Kudos to the chef, where in we requested them for some indian breakfast and the next day he had potato paranthas (as we are pure vegetarians) ready for us. Cant compliment the staff for their courtesy and promptness enough. Location wise, its a mixed bag as it is close to the metro, but i was not comfortable using the metro very late in the night. Anyway the city centre is a 7-10 euro ride away by cab, which i feel is a far better way to get there, plus ypu get to see the beautiful city also. The only reason i have given this hotel 4 stars is 1) The drape was stained2) The kettle was not clean( which i had shown the receptionist upon check out)3) Lack of plug points, which in this day and age is a necessity. 4)Pay parking, even though the hotel owns itWill not hesitate in recommending this hotel and looking forward to staying again."
Sep 2017,40,Good Food,"The location is not very convenience, but quiet at night. The room was clean with all the amenities I need. I like the tea provided in the room.I like the breakfast because of the variety of food, especially the local special (ham, cheese, dessert...).I also enjoy the dinner with traditional Portuguese dishes in the hotel."
Sep 2017,50,Lovely hotel,"We were most impressed with this beautiful luxury hotel where we stayed for 3 nights before a Mediterranean cruise. Everything about it was faultless   The room was perfect, the staff all excellent , and the breakfasts delicious.  We enjoyed eating breakfast outside on the terrace. The hotel is located out with the city centre but there is a nearby metro station, with a very frequent easy to use service"
Sep 2017,50,"Very, very nice hotel with very friendly staff","We stayed for 5 nights at the Corinthia and we had a wonderful time there. Clean and complete room, everything you could need was there. The breakfast was amazing and more than complete. Swimming pool, spa, location, everything was more than we expected. Near the subway, so in no time you can reach the city center. We can recommend this hotel to everyone, it is a wonderful experience staying at the Corinthia."
Sep 2017,50,Guest of the day,"Me and my husband were thriled to be anounced that we were chosen as ""Guest of the day"" when we checked in. Which gave us free access not only to the spa area, but also to the executive lounge and we were also upgraded to a junior suite where we jad a fruit basket, some pastries and a bottle of Porto wine. We loved the surprise and found our stay very pleasant.The hotel staff were very nice and helpful. I only found it odd that you have ro pay for the parking."
Sep 2017,50,Luxurious Hotel with fantastic staff & facilities,"The hotel's location is pretty good. It's not in the cultural center but a few stops away from the subway and the subway is extremely close and also there's a railroad station and most buses come nearby so you can pretty much go anywhere easily. You do appreciate the fact that it's not as crowded with people as the cultural center as it is quieter.The hotel itself is really luxurious, the rooms are very spacious, all is clean and very quiet.The most fantastic aspect of the hotel is the swimming pool and the spa. The spa itself is amazing and the staff is so kind.Will definitely go back there if I come back to Lisboa."
Sep 2017,50,great value; not in the city center but next to the metro and cabs are inexpensive,"great value; not in the city center (about 2 miles away) but next to the metro and cabs are inexpensive. nice hot baths. nice indoor pool; caps required. helpful management, worth it's five stars. gave us an upgrade."
Sep 2017,50,Perfect stay,"Very friendly and helpful staff in the excutive lounge. Good breakfast. Nice spacious and clean rooms. Bar and terrace are very cosy they really invite you to stay their for an ""long drink"". Hotel is good situated in Lisbon close to train and metro station."
Sep 2017,50,Portugal Wedding and Tours,"The main objective of my trip to Portugal was to attend a wedding in South Portugal ... SEISEMBRA.. a church in Espichel..  I stayed at CORINTHIA to do my Tours . FADO and dinner nite.  SINTRA , Pena castle .  Fatima, OBIDOS, Nazare and BATALHA ."
Sep 2017,40,Superb concierge,"We stayed her for 2 nights on the first leg of our Portugal trip the last week of August. Our flight arrived early in the morning so when we got to the hotel, we still had about 4 hours to wait till we could check in (2pm)....the front desk were very nice about and and promised to have a room ready for us by noon, since we had arrived on an international flight. Sure enough, by 12.30pm we had our room keys in our hand. The location of the hotel is not best suited for a holiday, but there was a metro station about 5 minutes away...our room was very nice and big enough for us (3 adults).  The best thing about the hotel was the local knowledge, helpfulness and patience of the concierge staff...twice a day, mornings and evenings, they gave us good advice about places to visit, restaurants to eat at, made phone calls for us, gave us handy tips, always with a smile and never running out of patience.  breakfast was good with a wide variety and the restaurant staff were likewise always smiling & helpful. Now, if they could only shift the property closer to downtown, this would always be my hotel of choice :)"
Sep 2017,40,Convenient and Clean,"Stayed at the Corinthia in summer 2016. It was very convenient to the subway, buses, and tour buses. The breakfast was amazing, and had a wide variety of choices from which to select.The staff was very accommodating and remembered what we liked and had it waiting for us before we asked. The rooms were clean, and we had a nice view as well."
Aug 2017,50,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed here for a last minute city break. When we arrived, we were told that we were selected as the 'guest of the day'. We were given an upgraded room, which was a nice suprise. The executive sky lounge was amazing, can't praise all the staff up there enough for their helpfulness. Food was always very nice, and the spa was enjoyable too. Overall we had a great time staying at this hotel and would definitely recommend it to others. Thanks, Liam Hughes and Elizabeth Doyle."
Aug 2017,30,Didn't really live up to the standards ,"Nice hotel, can't deny that one. But have to say the check in wasn't as smooth as you would expect. Somewhat rude I would even say. And the worst: we ordered breakfast I to our room as we had to leave to the airport early. Breakfast was supposed to arrive at 6:15am but by the time we had to leave, we didn't get any breakfast. Only reason we got was ""we don't have any order for breakfast"" although we specifically ordered it, and the reception girl clearly did the order via phone in front of us. In many ways the hotel was not flexible at all. I would not recommend to stay here unless you get it super super cheap. I give them full points for their amazing breakfast, just make sure you don't expect them to deliver anything in your room. Go downstairs and enjoy the buffet. OH and it's a pity the pool is an indoor pool, and wearing a swim cap is mandatory if you have any hair..."
Aug 2017,20,Construction ,"I reached out to the hotel in advance and let them know this property would be our first stop after coming out of a 6.5 red eye. My request was to give us a quiet room away from the elevator and accommodate an early check in. The hotel reservation representative let me know he could accommodate the quiet room but couldn't guarantee early check in. Fast forward to arrival day, we arrived at 10:15a and were asked to give them an hour to prepare the room. After an hour and a half of waiting, we were provided with our room, right next door to the elevator. We accepted it, and got into bed for what was supposed to be a 2-3 hour nap. We had two young children that needed the rest. 20 minutes in, hammering began, 10 minutes after that, it sounded like jack hammers were INSIDE the room with us. It took 4 calls to understand that there was construction being done 3 floors directly below us. Our ask was to cease construction for 2 hours and their option was to move us to a higher floor. We were told that construction would not begin until 10a the next morning however, 8:30a, we woke to the hammering again. They tried to help but to be honest, we were happy to check out when the time came. The hotel is beautiful and breakfast was done very well. It's the main reason I didn't give it a lower rating."
Aug 2017,50,Lovely indoor Pool,This Hotel is located near the Zoo and out of town. The rooms are of good size and the beds comfortable. My favourite part of the hotel is the amazing indoor swimming pool which is heat at 30 degrees.
Aug 2017,50,First Time in Lisbon!,"We booked this hotel in early 2017 after considerable research.  We arrived in Lisbon after a very long transatlantic flight from Canada. When our cab arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a bell service representative who helped us with our luggage.  Check in took longer than North American standards but it is understandable as they take passport information for all out of country guests.  We made our way to our room and our bags came shortly thereafter.  The room was very large by European standards.  We were jet lagged and tried very hard to stay awake until the dinner.  We had an early dinner and went swimming in the hotel indoor pool after a short walk around the neighbourhood.  The swimming pool was very nice with a small area for young children.  My kids loved it!  In the pool, we noticed that all the other guests were wearing swimming caps. Lesson learned for North American tourists - guests are required to wear swimming caps when using the pool.       Breakfast was included in our stay at Corinthia Hotel.  It was a great breakfast with considerable variety for everyone.  It also helped as we have young kids and there are very few restaurants in the neighbourhood.  There is a Metro station close to the hotel - Sete Rios.  We took the Metro to several places during our 3 days in Lisbon - shopping at Colombo and Centro Vasco da Gama, sight seeing and dinner at Bairro Alto.  We found it very easy to navigate the Metro in Lisbon.We were very pleased with Corinthia Hotel and would recommend it to anyone.  Thank you Corinthia for making our first trip to Lisbon a memorable one."
Aug 2017,40,Good experience in Lisbon,"Good room, comfortable and modern gym open 24/7.A medium pool is available open between the 06:30 to 22:00.The WiFi network is very good and fast; the TV are recent so it is possible to connect USB/Hard Disk for viewing personal media"
Aug 2017,50,Luxury for family in Lisbon,"Top flight luxury hotel, very comfortable. The highlights are the swimming pool, sumptuous breakfast and very friendly staff. Although not near the historical part of the city it's a straight line on the metro and easy enough access. Also very easily accessible from the airport."
Aug 2017,30,"Great hotel, bad reception","I’m not sure where to begin with this review.The hotel is beautiful with gleaming public areas, very comfortable rooms, a lovely pool and an excellent bar.  Our junior suite was a good size with an enormous, incredibly comfortable bed.  Contrary to other reviews the aircon worked well and the room was very quiet and peaceful.  Breakfast was fantastic with a huge selection of high quality breakfast staples and local delicacies (the scrambled eggs were poor but everything else was wonderful).  The bar was very nice and the food and cocktails were both fantastic.  Service in the bar was also quick, efficient and friendly.  We stayed for 4 nights and have no complaints whatsoever about the room, housekeeping, bar and restaurant staff, concierge, doormen or pool, all of which were as you’d expect at a 5 star hotel.Unfortunately, our experience was soured somewhat by our treatment at both check-in and check-out.  On arrival (myself, my wife, our 10-month old son and disabled mother-in-law) we were told that our rooms were not ready because the previous occupants had not vacated.  We arrived 2 and a half hours after the advertised check-in time so were somewhat surprised by this but these things do sometimes happen.  After leaving us waiting in reception for 30 minutes, the receptionist finally came back and told us we would have to wait another 90 minutes and then the rooms “might” be ready.  By this point our baby needed to nap and my wife and mother-in-law were exhausted after 8 hours of travelling and 2 flights.  We asked to speak to a manager who eventually appeared and told us there was nothing he could do.  We explained that this was unacceptable and he then offered to upgrade us to the executive floor where rooms were ready.  After more phone calls we finally made it to our rooms and there was no crib or kettle.  A quick call to room service resolved this.I later discovered that although we had been “upgraded” to the executive floor, this did not include use of the executive lounge which was not made clear to me at the time the upgrade was given.  Again, not a huge problem but I’d rather this had been made clear at the time.On checking out, the receptionist handed me my invoice which showed I had been charged for the upgrade.  At the time the manager told me that “there is nothing to pay” and “everything is taken care of” but the receptionist checked and confirmed that this was not what I had been promised.  I was more or less called a liar in front of a reception full of people.  The duty manager refused to speak to me and communicated with me through the receptionist on the telephone.  This ridiculous situation carried on for over 30 minutes at which point I told them I had to leave or I would miss my plane and stated that I would pay the remainder of my invoice and the upgrade fees could be discussed once I returned home.  I very clearly stated that they were not authorised to charge me the upgrade fees at that point and I signed an invoice which showed only the genuine costs I had incurred (food and drinks etc.).  I then returned home to find that the hotel had charged the upgrade fee to my credit card without authorisation.  After a further exchange of emails with the hotel during which they reiterated their position that I had never been promised a free upgrade, I asked for the contact details to make a formal complaint to the relevant tourism regulatory body and the hotel emailed back apologising for the misunderstanding and confirming that the charges would be refunded.I very much enjoyed my stay at the hotel.  The property is beautiful, the rooms are luxurious and the breakfast is amongst the best I’ve had.  The location is slightly out of the city centre but there is a taxi rank outside and we enjoyed being a little bit out of the busiest part of the city.  That said, the horrendous service I received at the start and end of my stay have put me off the hotel and I’m not sure I’d be able to recommend the hotel to others.   If I’m being charitable then this was a miscommunication which was then badly handled rather than a blatant attempt to rip off a tourist but it did take the shine off our stay somewhat."
Aug 2017,50,elegance in Lisbon,"Beautiful hotel, elegant room, very comfortable with excellent service and a huge assortment of breakfast items.  Many things to do on a city tour - the Tower of Belem, the monument to the Discoveries and the National Palace of Queluz."
Aug 2017,50,Fabulous,"We really loved this hotel from the moment we arrived until our departure. Our three night stay was made very special by the team in the executive lounge who did all they could to make us feel at home. Our room was 2214 and it enjoyed views out over the city that will stay with us for a long time. The food choices in the lounge were excellent throughout the day from breakfast through lunch and dinner. The views from the lounge were fantastic. Our room was really comfortable and well appointed, in fact it could not be faulted. We will return to this hotel to enjoy being pampered again."
Aug 2017,50,Luxury hotel... enjoyed it tremendously!,"Our final leg of the portugal tour was 2 nights at the Corinthia Hotel , Not only was the location close to the malls and restaurants, the Metro was also just around the corner. The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful. The rooms kept very clean and tidy & had clean towels and toiletries daily. Buffet breakfast was included iwith the suite and it was delish.. We also liked the indoor spa & swimming pool  and managed to find time for a quick dip before the end of the trip..  Taxis were easily available and the porters and staff at the foyer were really pleasant and helpful. We would definately come back to visit again...."
Aug 2017,50,Excellent experience ,From the moment we arrived we were met with friendliness and courtesy by the excellent staff of the hotel.  Our room was spotlessly clean and very spacious.  We particularly liked the welcome gift of custard tarts! I highly recommend the Corinthia for its excellent value and quality. It is well worth paying the little extra to avail of the Executive lounge-its fantastic.  The hotel is not within walking distance of the city but the excellent metro is just across the street and taxis are very reasonable.  Will stay in the Corinthia again on my next visit to Lisbon.
Aug 2017,50,Family of 7 adults and 8 children,"We had 6 rooms on floor 21  and booked for the concierge level on level 24.  We were in this hotel for 6 nights. 2 of the rooms were very large, the rest were a good size.  Large bathrooms, lots of hot water with good pressure. The only criticism would be that there was no storage in the bathroom for toiletries and make up.  They have shelves near the desk in the bedroom. Pity they were not in the bathroom   The bed was sooo comfortable and the bedlinen was of good quality. The chocolate on the pillow every night was a welcome touch.We ate breakfast on the concierge level every morning. Wonderful food and service. Omelettes made to order and a large array of buffet foods.   When breakfast is finished they have a lunch buffet and and hot food in the early evening. Tea, coffee and beverages available all day along with the excellent array of food  The family enjoyed every moment off our stay. Floor 24 gave us a place to congregate and enjoy being together after a day of sightseeing. The staff on the concierge level, floor 24 were so kind and caring. Daniel looked after us, nothing was too much trouble. Some of our party were without luggage for 2 days due to Delta fiasco. The reception lady on floor 24 phoned the airport constantly for 2 days. She was so concerned and determined to get that luggage delivered. I would recommend this hotel to everybody without hesitation.  It made our stay in Lisbon so enjoyable. I would love to return and enjoy it all again. This was my ideal hotel with the concierge level where the grandchildren ranging in age from 16 to 4 years were free to eat and drink whenever they desired and could enjoy being together.  I should mention that the elevator is computer programmed. Residents are provided with a slap card which is programmed to allow one access to various floors and is a wonderfu security system."
Aug 2017,50,First class,"We stayed a week in June in extremely hot weather, but on first being greeted by the concierge and our luggage taken into the lovely air conditioned hotel we felt calm and relaxed. The twin room had fabulous views, was selflessly clean and had everything we needed. Robes,slippers, hot and cold complimentary drinks. The beds were super comfy and the breakfast great. The bar was pricey but you expect that in five star, but we were only a short metro away from the city centre. Travelling is easy, just across the road from the metro and easy to get to Cascais and Sintra. The zoo is on the doorstep and totally brilliant to visit. Spa and pool too."
Aug 2017,50,Lovely hotel. Wonderful holiday,"This is one of the best 5 star hotels my wife and I have ever stayed. The rooms are flawlessly clean. Staff are very friendly and extremely polite. Always wanting to help. The check in and check out were flawless. The rooms are very quiet despite the fact that we could see aircrafts approaching the airport almost every 10 minutes. We didn't hear any aircraft noise. We  had a wonderful view of the city from our 16th floor room.The breakfast was one of the best we have ever paid for. There were a lot to choose from. If we were to stay for 4 weeks, i am sure we will have enough variety of meals to choose without repeating menus. It is certainly worth the price. No wonder the place is jammed with hotel residents every morning. The omelette was made to taste and specification despite the large number of people they had to cater for. The hotel even serves sparkling wine with breakfast! This is very uncommon in most 5 star hotels.Perhaps the most wonderful thing about this hotel is the personal touch they put into their activities. My birthday fell during our stay. The hotel, surprisingly, provided us with complimentary cake and wine to celebrate. I was also given a complimentary visit to the spa. The client service manager, Mauro Santos, took pains to write me personal birthday greetings as well.My wife and I will certainly return to the hotel on our next visit without hesitation.Thank you Corinthia Hotel, Lisbon"
Aug 2017,50,Awesome hotel close to public transport,"I stayed in Lisbon for a conference and work organised this hotel. It was a great choice. The hotel is modern and very well maintained. The rooms are spacious and feature great beds and clean modern bathroom. Staff is very friendly and accommodating as well.Breakfast features a large range of various breads, cereal and hot food as well as Portuguese specialities (but you would probably want to check them out in the city). There are also some local coffee places around if you're not feeling like a big breakfast!The bar and terrace area is open until quite late and has a nice range of food and beverages. They need some better staff here though: the service was ridiculously slow and staff seemed to argue a lot here. A totally different experience to the rest of the hotel. Don't expect quick service here.The hotel features a gym, but it feels a bit small for such a large number of rooms. The temperature in the gym was also ridiculously high for a workout. Fortunately they adjusted it after complaining (twice) about it and it became more bearable (still hot though). The Portuguese must not mind the heat.....While the hotel isn't really close to any sights in Lisbon and quite removed from the city centre, a taxi there will probably cost you less than Eur 10. There is also a train and metro station in walking distance, so it all works out well.All in all a great stay and a recommended hotel for a Lisbon citytrip if you're looking for a total hotel experience and don't mind paying a premium."
Aug 2017,50,Wonderful stay in Lisbon,"We had a lovely stay at the 21 first floor in Corinthia hotel Lisbon. The room was big with nice beds and a wonderful bathroom. We also had booked a room so we had axess to the executive lounche on the 24 first floor with a fantastic view over Lissabon from both side. The food and the drinks wete good and all the people working on the hotel was very helpful. The hotel was close to a metro statio and a train station, so it was easy to go in to town and we took the train to Sintra from there. We really enjoy our stay and we will be back!!!"
Aug 2017,50,"Beautiful hotel, great service","The hotel is beautiful and the service is fantastic. It is not as close to certain parts of Lisbon as I thought (the Alfama, Barrio Alto) but we also only stayed one night so didnt explore. But our experience there was fantastic!"
Aug 2017,20,Serious of disastrous events.,"4 Night stay ...No mention of renovation works on hotel website yet when we arrived there was an overwhelming drilling noise that filled the room. When we complained, we were told the hotel was undergoing renovation (had we known we would not have stayed here and purposely excluded other hotels in our search that mentioned renovation works. Extremely deceptive tactics employed by the hotel to attract guests.) After checking with a manager, the reception staff moved us to a new room on a higher floor so that it was away from the renovation. We could still hear the drilling but it was a faint noise and rather than raise another issue with reception we chose to ignore the faint noise, after all it was faint. That evening however we were mortified to find that the room we had been moved, was an adjoining room next to a family with a young child. Therefore we had to suffer all evening to the sound of a crying baby. We were also woken up early in the morning to the baby crying once again. We do not like to complain and so did not complain at reception again but dealt with it. The same thing happened the next night and we could not deal with it and so had to complain again! What was supposed to be a relaxing break, the hotel turned into a disastrous stay and break. To add insult to injury, I emailed the hotel prior to arrival that the purpose of the trip was for an anniversary weekend celebration and break. Not one person said happy anniversary, and we had to deal with the disastrous sequence of events with the hotel, making it far from a special occasion. To top it all off, in two of the rooms we were moved to, there were dirty black marks on the towels!! I cannot express how disappointed I was with the hotel. Definitely the worst 5* hotel I have stayed in, surprising given how prestigious this hotel is in London (one of the reasons we chose to stay here. Clearly different standards in different locations with this chain). Further taking away from customer service, when we moved rooms, no one turned up to help with luggage and although we were told we had been upgraded to a new room due to being unsatisfied, the upgrade only meant a higher floor away from noise and none of the other services that come with a higher floor room like access to the lounge. It was a feel good line to say you have been upgraded to a higher floor to move away from the noise, not sorry for the inconvenience. The only thing I would recommend about this hotel is the spa and solely the spa."
Aug 2017,50,Great family break,"We had a four night break here as a family and found it to be a great base for exploring Lisbon.As previous reviewers have said, it is a bit out of town, but there is easy access:- to/from the Airport (Metro is 13 stops, one change; Yellow bus airport service stops nearby to hotel; about 24 euros by cab from airport cab rank). - few minutes walk to the metro for getting into Lisbon- Yellow Bus for tour of Lisbon, stop is 5 minute walk and you can get tickets from Concierge. Worth asking about 48 and 72 hour options (bus, tram and boat) if you are interested.The hotel is also well located for restaurants if you can't be bothered to travel back into town for dinner. We would recommend:Restaurante Acacias, practically next door.Konceito Indian restaurant, 10 minute walk from the back of the hotel. Really worth staying at the Corinthis so you can eat here.Pano De Boca at the Teatro Aberto, 5 minutes walk out of the back of the hotel. English speaking waitress was really helpful, food was excellent.The hotel itself is beautifully decorated, extremely clean and the staff are very friendly and professional. The gardens are beautiful and immaculately maintained.Our room was large, comfortable and quiet, and it is really nice to have tea & coffee making facilities.Breakfast was fabulous - everything you could possibly want. Food constantly being refreshed, no waiting for clean dishes to be available etc. Great fresh coffee.The swimming pool is great after a long day sight seeing, although it is busy between 3pm and 6pm. It's very clean and staff regularly bringing clean towels. Yes, you have to wear a swim hat, but as everyone is, you soon get used to that. Buy them from the spa for 2 euros 50.The only thing I would say, and this is to be expected in a 5 star hotel, the bar and mini bar prices are eye watering. 5 euros for a small packet of Pringles or for a small coke cola. With the exchange rate as it is, that's practically £5 for Brits. Luckily there is a great little supermarket in the Metro system where you can stock up.All in all, we would definitely stay here again."
Aug 2017,40,Corinthia Hotel Lisbon,"We upgraded to an executive suite which was very nice as it was my husband's 50th birthday - it had a large bedroom, separate living room and an additional toilet which was very handy as there were 3 of us staying in the room, and 2 TVs which was great as we have a 4 year old.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast in the executive lounge was nice and did not have a lot of people so you did not have to queue up to get an omelette / pancakes.  Although the breakfast downstairs was also good the layout could be arranged better for example the bacon / sausages on the counter could be relocated to a different position as people are queueing up for their omelette etc. and can get a bit chaotic / confusing.  Other than that the breakfast has a lot to offer."
Aug 2017,50,always a lovely visit,"friendly staff , great rooms and you cant beat their burgers ! the pool area is well mantained and very comfortable . Also a lovely area to sunbathe and enjoy the heat of Lisbon . A great hotel only 10 minutes from the airport by taxi ."
Aug 2017,50,Excellent people run this Excellent hotel.,Everyone working there was very kind and helpful. The service was fantastic and they made us feel very special. Both of the connected rooms we had were very clean and comfortable. The food the hotel served was delicious. They gave a good advice about the trip to Sintra.Overall an excellent experience.Special thanks to the executive club team.
Aug 2017,50,"Modern, Comfortable and Spacious","Our (rather stressed) family of four stayed for two nights when our flight to Madeira was cancelled, twice. We found the hotel spacious and comfortable, with all the usual amenities. The indoor pool was on the small side, and guests had to pay extra for swim caps to be able to swim in it (even those with no hair). There was a good choice of breakfast, and we enjoyed the atmosphere during breakfast time. We found the staff at the courtesy desk very friendly and helpful. The hotel was within two minutes' walking distance of the metro, which made it convenient for travelling into town."
Aug 2017,50,Two weeks in Kisbon,"A 5 star gem outside the centre of Lisbon but easy to get to. Excellent facilities, service and offerings. Great rooms and Staff. Had use of the great Executive Lounge on 24th floor. Great Bar and Terrace"
Jul 2017,50,"Clean, Modern and Luxurious","Very nice hotel.  Spotlessly clean and modern.  Very close to Sete Rios Train / Bus / Metro station, making it convenient to get anywhere, anytime.  Also close to a variety of local restaurants.  Felt like a safe location also."
Jul 2017,50,Nice touch ,Just to say my partner had her birthday whilst staying at the Corinthia and they totally made her day. Champagne in the morning and then when we returned tonight a cake and a bottle of champagne. This is a nice touch and the difference between good and great !! Thanks team I will recommend to all
Jul 2017,50,Obrigado Corinthia Lisbon,"Obrigado Corinthia LisbonWe accomodated in Corinthia Lisbon 4th-7th and 8th-12th July 2017. During 7th-8th July we visited the city of Porto. First of all, special thanks to Daniel and Rute in the Executive Sky Club and to Mauro Santos. All the staff was very friendly.Our executive rooms were spotless and beautifull. The beds were a little too soft. Overall, nice rooms, great turn down service and exelent housekeeping. The pool and the spa were nice. Remember to take your own swim cap. They give us the feeling, that we are professional swimmers with swim caps.Exceptional Sky Club lounge on 24th floor with breath taking view, really worth of little extra money.Next summer we will come back! We are fans of Corinthia hotels.Thank you really much!"
Jul 2017,50,Wonderful stay,Great staff.Provided a champagne as we were celebrating our anniversary. A little way out of the city centre. Taxis were very reasonable as well. Did not try the metro.Hotel also provides discount coupon to the Lisbon Zoo
Jul 2017,50,The best place to stay in Lisbon!,"Collected at the airport by car which was lovely, obviously you will need to pay extra for the transfer. Wonderful service at check in. Fantastic room and view of the aquaduct and out across the city. The service throughout our week long stay was exemplary, nothing was too much trouble and they were always on hand should you need anything. We had an executive room which gave access to the executive sky lounge on the top floor. The lounge always has a complimentary buffet and drinks available for you to sit, relax and enjoy the views. I would particularly call out the excellent service from Sofia, Rute,  Daniel, Ram and Marcio here they helped make out stay an absolute joy. The Tipico restaurant is lovely too we ate here three times, food and service is always excellent. The hotel may feel a little out of the city centre, however nothing is more than a few stops on the metro or 15mins in a taxi."
Jul 2017,50,Very nice,"Very nice hotel 10 minutes from the airport. Cost 8 euros with Uber. Don t take a taxi it costed us 28 euros! Closed to the MTR. Big room, big bed. Some receptionists speak French, English. Swimming pool but you need to buy a swimhat at 2.50 euros..."
Jul 2017,50,Great hotel,Just simply a great hotel. If you want a hotel that meets all your criteria this is the hotel. We loved our room amazing bedding and great location. Also I am over the trip advisor rule for 200  word reviews.
Jul 2017,40,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel that is on the edge of the main Lisbon attractions. However there is a taxi rank right outside the hotel and the metro subway right across the road. Both options are reasonably priced so getting around is no problem. We had a huge comfortable room with floor to ceiling windows. All staff who we dealt with were helpful, professional and pleasant to deal with. The outdoor bar area was a very pleasant place to have a drink with a large screen T V and comfortable seating. We didnt use the indoor pool as swimming caps were compulsory and we were not keen on this rule. The hotel restaurant seemed souless so this too we gave a miss and ate out in some fabulous places in Lisbon. The hotel would benefit from an outdoor pool and indeed has the soace for one. While we were there we could hear maintenance works being conducted which we were not told about when we checked in, so I would ask when you check in if your room is likely to be affected. All in all this is a great comfortable hotel with high service levels with reasonable room rates."
Jul 2017,40,Breakfast was best ever! ,Super hotel with wonderfully helpful staff at every turn - all of whom speak English. Breakfast was 5* with a wide range of buffet items to select from for a fixed price. Weather was glorious and we lingered outside on the spacious patio drinking many cups of delicious espresso with our spread. Hotel room was nice. Bed and pillows very comfy indeed. Missed having some drawers though to put away some clothes so knocking off one point for that. Great view of city from 13th floor. Eating options are to right of hotel as you exit. Metro is to the left. Would definitely stay here again.
Jul 2017,50,Very nice hotel. ,Great hotel with many plus points. Firstly the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Nothing is too much trouble. The reception area is very nice with plenty of seats to rest and watch the world go by. Rooms are spacious and clean with ample amenities provided. I ordered Breakfast several times during my stay and was superb. The room service comes in a small trolley which folds out to become a table. The omelette was particularly tasty!A lovely restaurant the hotel is a must do. It's a Brazilian buffet a few meters down the road. A great recommendation by the concierge and a must do!All in all a lovely stay!
Jul 2017,30,Unacceptable,"Booked a couple of days for some rest and quiet after travelling continuously for three weeks. However, it was anything but! We had to put up with noise of drilling and hammering for almost 12 hours each day while intensive works were carried out in a nearby room. It was so bad we couldn't hear ourselves speak and had no choice but to go elsewhere when all we wanted was to rest. I complained and was offered a couple of hours respite in their executive lounge but that was no compensation for a miserable stay in a room that should not have been occupied while the works were in ptogress. Nice hotel but rotten service."
Jul 2017,50,Just fabulous hotel must go ,"I booked the hotel about 6 weeks ago and made a mistake I thought the hotel was closer to downtown and was to late to cancel ( no refund) but I was surprise to find how close the hotel was from downtown only 7 euro by cab. Got there and I was the winer of an upgrade. Goes the executive room, for the price of my deluxe room on the 23rd floor, access to the executive lounge on the 24th floor, breakfast included (i already paid for it with my packaged) beer, wine all free, access to water bath, for 2 people a value of $460 cdn instead of purchased price of 240cdn. The staff were all fantastic with us, from the people at reception, at the bar, lounge. Don't  look for another hotel this is the one if you have the budget.  5 stars hotel without any questions. Pat"
Jul 2017,50,Excellent hotel for a conference,"I stayed at this hotel to attend an on-site conference.  It is a very nice hotel - beautiful, clean with very friendly staff.  The food in the restaurant was very good.  The terrace lounge is very luxurious.  It is 6 subway stops from downtown.  All in all, a very pleasant experience"
Jul 2017,50,Luxury hotel,"All was perfect. Big room, good food, very friendly staff. The swimming pool was also beautiful, did not have time to try the spa, though (was a little expensive also). Only problems: you have to wear a swimming cap to go in the swimming pool and to visit the city you have to take a taxi or the subway. It is a pity because the fun thing about Lisbon is to discover the city by foot."
Jul 2017,40,"Beautiful Hotel, but Not Central to Much","Overall, this hotel is beautiful and modern with a very friendly staff. The location is ok, but not near much. We had to take taxi's everywhere we went. As for the room, the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom is large and new. My two gripes with this hotel were that I couldn't get the room to a cool sleeping temperature, regardless of how low I set the thermostat. Secondly, there are no electrical outlets near the bed and no alarm clock in the room. Just an annoying thing, but shows poor design. I'd probably stay here again, but I'd call and ask for a room where I could actually change the temperature, or perhaps a lower floor where it would be cooler."
Jul 2017,50,Great hotel for our flying visit to Lisbon,"We recently did a multi centre holiday through Portugal and were fortunate to book the Corinthia hotel for our Lisbon stay. I was aware that the hotel was not centrally located but it still appealed. I am so glad I went with my gut instinct as it was a fabulous stay! We had an executive room on one of the higher floors, which we were able to check into straight away. The rooms are not huge, but very comfortable and clean with incredible far reaching views. With the executive room we had access to the club lounge on the top floor. It is worth paying the extra for this - it is a very large open space with all day refreshments and the views over the river and bridge are superb. The staff in the lounge were first class, very friendly and helpful. I have a dairy and gluten intollerance, I only had to ask for Soya milk and gluten free bread once, after this point, they always remembered and would bring me a selection to include cakes, whenever I entered the lounge - and always service with a smile! The breakfast was excellent with a chef cooking eggs to order. We didn't eat in the main restaurant as the lounge was so good. They also have a good selection of snacks throughout the day which was great. With regards to the location - yes, it is out of the centre, but the metro is not far. Or, if like us you like a stroll, it is only about 15 minutes to the top of the large park which leads down to the main avenue and from there, it is a beautiful walk all the way to the harbour. It took us about an hour, but we really enjoyed all the sights along the way. It is a little up hill on the way back, but enjoy it! Failing that, taxis are everywhere and very cheap. We were only in Lisbon a couple of days, not enough to do any more than scratch the surface. We really loved the city and will definitely return and will stay at the Corinthia again without hesitation. Highly recommended."
Jul 2017,50,Week end in lisbon,"What a great city break staying at lovely hotel.This was our first stay at the Corinthian.The room was modern spacious and bright, staff helpful and the food delicious.I have no hesitation in recommending a stay. Oh yes try to get a high room for a smashing  view of the city. PS the breakfasts were wonderful!"
Jul 2017,40,Great Hotel - slightly out of centre,Great hotel with very friendly and helpful staff which made up for not being bang in the centre of town. We stayed in an executive suite with access to the lounge (breakfast/snacks/drinks) which was well worth the extra money. Fantastic family restaurant across the road too.
Jul 2017,40,Large Room,"Only room of our 17 day trip with king sized bed, and most comfortable! Large room with sofa, but no outlet for  dryer in bathroom. Nice view. Fifteen minute walk to Gulbankian. Not central, but close to metro. Good breakfast buffet with the usual fare. Scan room card and elevator takes you directly to your floor. Some construction noise, but quiet at night."
Jul 2017,40,Hotel stay,"Very nice 2 night stay. If you need help, Ana, Concierge is exceptional. Hotel is a little away from downtown. Taxis are very available. We found the local area to be quiet and pleasant. Convenient for the airport."
Jul 2017,40,"Brief stay, wish we'd had more time","Very nice hotel in a good location. We would have enjoyed more time in Lisbon and at this hotel, but our flight was delayed so rather than having 1-1/2 days in Lisbon we had no time to tour or enjoy an evening :-( !! We arrived at midnight (and the staff was ready for us!) and needed to board a cruise at 10:30a the next day. Room was very spacious and clean. Very nice hotel and great breakfast to send us off on our cruise."
Jul 2017,50,Good location / Friendly Staff,We had been in Lisbon for a week and were now hooking up with a Travel Group. They had us staying at this hotel. It was clean and had a good breakfast. The front desk staff was beyond helpful. We had seen a lot of Lisbon and the surrounding towns and wanted something very local. Not only did they tell us to go to the zoo which was half a mile away but they gave us coupons as well. The metro is a block away and taxis are always available. We ate local ....walk out of the hotel and take a right and a block down were some local favorites . We were happy with the food and the price at one place that looked like a breakfast spot but was for dinners as well. Stay here but see downtown as well.
Jul 2017,50,We loved our stay!,"We stayed in the Corinthia Hotel for 4 nights and it was a wonderful stay. The hotel is clean, tastefully decorated with fresh flowers all around and modern. Hotel staff are eager to assist and provided excellent service. We had access to the executive lounge (24th floor) and would highly recommend including this in your stay. The view is fantastic and we could see the 25 de Abril Bridge, Águas Livres Aqueduct and the statue of Cristo-Rei very clearly on all the days. The lounge serves food all day from breakfast to dinner and the food was very well cooked - we especially enjoyed the drinks selection, egg tarts, omelette and fresh fruits. Really a wonderful hotel with top notch service. Very satisfied with our stay and would definitely come back"
Jul 2017,40,Great Experience,"The hotel is close to the highway and is close to everything. The staff is super pleasant and friendly. The concierge offers great recommendations. The food is wonderful and the overall ambiance is excellent. Although the rooms are a good size I think the showers are old, and need to be refurbished to go with the overall look of the hotel and lobby. I especially liked the elevators that are modern and not noisy.  I enjoyed cocktails with the piano player. The breakfast buffet was very rich"
Jul 2017,40,Nice stay at Corinthia Lisbon,"I was travelling for my work and stayed 4 days at the hotel. The 1st day I had an issue with air-conditionner, but resolved quickly by the staff.The room was good, the bed very comfortable. The hotel's restaurant is very nice and great for taking breakfast of lunch.The thing to enhance is the lift! When there are lots of people in the morning or in the evening, you wait a while for the lift, and you can not take the stairs as with your key card you can only access your floor and you can not go to other floors!"
Jun 2017,50,Fantastic experience,"This Hotel is very well equipped. The Spa, the bar, the rooms are all well balanced and very comfortable. The staff is very helpful and professional. The overall experience  was very positive and highly recommendable."
Jun 2017,50,Heaven,"Got upgraded to an executive room- and service was impeccable! Beautiful room with breathtaking views, and use of the lounge on 24th floor. Helpful hostess, and I even made use of the aquatic facility, which was divine!"
Jun 2017,50,One of the best in Lisbon at all המלצה ,"I visited Portugal for 8 days and I booked only 5 stars hotel , I tried 4 hotels .., and Corinthia was the best : Great service Wonderful roomTasty and rich breakfast Fantastic pool and spa ( wow) Easy parking Fair price ממולץ מאוד למי יש לו רכב שכור חבל על הזמן מלון אדיר רחוק מהרעש אבל אחד המיוחדים ."
Jun 2017,50,a week in Corinthia Lisbon,"came for 5 nights and booked as it was in my company's hotels list. wasn't expecting much as usually it's in many cases, shady hotels :-(was a delightful surprise to find an ""old school"" hotel with nice rooms fluffy towels and amazing breakfast ranging from fresh fruits through omelet made with ingredients of your choice or waffles to hand carved prosciutto and a large variety of cheese. service was very good.the Hotel is also very close to a metro station. The only thing that didn't work well was the TV, seems like an IP-TV solution, since every now and then (quite often) the TV just froze for a minute or tow or wasn't switching to the station, but that's the only thing I have, definitely coming back to this hotel next time I'm in Lisbon.oh yes, the price, was low, less than 100 Euro per night, worth every penny."
Jun 2017,50,Very pretty hotel with great service,"We enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia very much.  We had a corner room on a high floor, which may have been a free upgrade, as it seemed larger than the ones around it.  Our room had a lovely view of the Lisbon Aqueduct. The hotel is not in the city center, but public transportation (metro and bus) are quite close and easy to use.  Uber is also pretty inexpensive in Lisbon.  We didn't have time to use the pool.  The turndown service was an unexpected plus.  The bathroom was nicely equipped with a bidet."
Jun 2017,50,"Corinthia, an enterprise-grade high quality and service hotel.","This hotel offers a large panel of services, pool, gym, restaurants with a level of quality that even individual service provider are not able to reach. Warm welcome, professional employees. Great choice for your stay in Lisbon"
Jun 2017,50,Another wonderul stay at Corinthia Lisboa,"The hotel may be on the outskirts of Lisbon but with the tube/metro station just a short walk away, the whole of Lisbon is on your hotel doorstep. Upon arrival you know that you are entering a lovely 5* hotel, the reception staff and door staff are courteous and very welcoming, it's like they are so happy that you have chosen to stay at their hotel. The rooms are lovely and clean with crisp linen on the beds and soft towels in the well appointed bathrooms. The hotel has an amazing gym, pool and bar area (terrace and inside), the hotel ambience is cool, calm and relaxing. The hotel breakfast is amongst the best I've experienced, every taste is catered for. Personally I stay at this hotel on every trip to Lisbon, I would recommend 100%."
Jun 2017,50,Just Fantastic ,"We checked in here, yesterday and it was effortless and professional. The staff are friendly and always happy to help.The rooms are spacious and clean. The beds are amazingly comfortable. Breakfast is also wonderful. This hotel is just brilliant, a bit out of the centre but that didn't really bother us."
Jun 2017,50,Lisbon visit,"The hotel is superb. Our rooms were well appointed and spotlessly clean. The main memory of our short stay was the quality of the Staff. Without exception they were courteous,friendly and  helpful and keen to ensure that you enjoyed your stay at their hotel. We have stayed with the Corinthia hotel group before and this hotel certainly met the high standard that one would expect from such a superb company.We cannot wait to return!"
Jun 2017,50,Super Comfort 😁,"We spent 3 nights here and wished we could have stayed longer.  We would definitely stay here again when we return to Lisbon.  Good location near to the metro.  Our room was spacious and very comfortable (including the bed).  Huge choice of breakfast including fruit, mixed healthy juices, fried favourites and continental cheese and meats."
Jun 2017,50,Luxury hotel on outskirts of Lisbon,"Excellent hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Very comfortable room. Nothing was too much trouble. Superb pool and spa facilities.50 minute walk to Lisbon centre, or you can catch the Metro opposite."
Jun 2017,50,Complete redemption,"Having previously criticised this hotel for their facilities, we were invited back after their refurbishment.  What a pleasant surprise. We had a wonderful weekend at a great hotel, with excellent gym facilities. We will certainly be returning again."
Jun 2017,50,Amazing Stay,"We booked this hotel as our last hotel during a weeklong trip around Portugal and wish we had booked it for longer than one night. The hotel is very tastefully decorated inside and has great amenities. The staff are great and the rooms are very comfortable. We ended up ordering room service and it was super quick and easy. We unfortunately weren't able to try out the breakfast since we had early flights but the garden area looked great to sit in and enjoy breakfast. We did get a chance to try out the pool and it was a pleasure. Only thing is you have to wear a cap when in the water but if you don't have you can purchase from the spa reception area. We also had a peek inside the gym and it was very well equipped and clean. Again, had we stayed for longer I would for sure have tried it out. Overall this hotel is great and you won't be disappointed. Once we return to Lisbon we will be staying here again."
Jun 2017,50,excelent experience,"I've staid in Corinthia Hotel invited by a supplier due to a Convention. The facilities, personal and food were excelent.I highly recomend it. Also the location is perfect because the subway is 2 minutes walking and also have buses to the city center. There's also a shopping center just across the street"
Jun 2017,50,Fabulous!,"Lovely hotel, staff very friendly.Room very spacious and comfortable with good facilities. Bar area was very good with large selection of drinks available and a resident pianist who was amazing.  Breakfasts were exceptional! Never been to a hotel with so much choice including lots of local delicacies to try. Lots of taxis to hand outside the hotel door.  Special mention for Paulo Pinto who runs Jungle Taxis.  He was amazing and exceptionally  helpful."
Jun 2017,30,Wouldn't rate it as 5*,"Nothing special about the hotel 5* but I would rather give 4* , we stayed there over the weekend,  outside terrace if you want to order food you will wait at least 50min to arrive and it's only snacks I think it's a bit too long for a snack , when we use swimming my child left his t-shirt there when we realise after 5min we went back to ask for it the person behind the desk wasn't very helpful asked what colour was it and then went to look for it she came back after few seconds and said it's not there . We had one room with a child staying there we ask for extra bed, the single bed was there with a big nails sticking out when we ask to change the bad we were told all of them was like that, it is not safe at all . The hotel was in a good location"
Jun 2017,50,Wonderful Hotel,"My husband and I with our 13 year old daughter stayed here 10days in Easter, We really enjoyed our stay.  My daughter and I had a spa day together which was fab, it was a little expensive, but the experience was wonderful, totally pampered, smoothed, relaxed and worth every penny. The ladies really took care of us. You can book tickets for the aquarium  at the conceige desk, beating the long queues when you arrive, you can also get discount coupons for the zoo, with is just around the corner and has an amazing dolphin show daily.  There is a huge shopping mall around a 5 min taxi drive away called the Columbo Centre.  The breakfast is 5star with an egg chef, champagne and jamon serrano carved daily, as well as all the usual items and you can also choose to eat your breakfast outside.  We tried the restaurant once, but had an incredibly long wait as they forgot about us!.....food was good though.  It was nice sitting out on the outside terrace with a drink in the evenings.  Free Wifi for 5 devices, not many sockets in the room, business centre for free computer/printer, which was great for our boarding passes. Staff very helpful and attentive.  The swimming pool was good, but it would of been nice if there was a drinks/snack bar on the sun terrace next to the pool.  The tube was nearby but we went everywhere by taxi as they were so cheap and convenient.  4 restaraunts out on the street nearby, with lovely food and an all you can eat chinese/japanese buffett just up the road.  Small supermarket just over the road.  We really enjoyed our stay and would definately stay here again.  nice room too."
Jun 2017,50,Fabulous service ,I great hotel with immediate links to the centre. The staff were exceptionally helpful and courteous and offered us a generous upgrade at a reasonable price. It is a perfect hotel for luxury on a reasonable budget. I'd recommend this highly!
Jun 2017,50,Elegant Hotel..Amazing Views,"My husband and I recently visited Portugal and our hotel stay was one of the best aspects of our trip. The hotel staff were the utmost professionals, and literally at our service for all request.  The room and all parts of the hotel was immaculate. Our room had the most amazing views of the city.  The restaurant served an amazing dinner, full of flavor and excellent choices.  The bar/patio area was so refreshing... great music (live D.J.), and tasty bar/comfort food.  They provided chairs, big screen t.v., heaters if you get cold, and light cover ups.  The breakfast buffet was amazing as well...a welcomed treat each morning.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Lisbon!One Con: A separate smoking area in the bar/patio area would make it so much better on non smokers.  My husband and I had to cut our outside patio time short each night as we are non smokers but ended up overwhelmed by people smoking all around us.  Non smokers deserve to enjoy the patio area as well.Thank you to each and every member of your staff...You all really made our stay worthwhile!"
Jun 2017,40,Great hotel with a good breakfast but a terrible dinner,"We liked the hotel, the room, the Executive Lounge and mostly the friendly and helpful staff here. The breakfast buffet was excellent each morning and considering the large numbers eating there, this was impressive.The one mistake we made was dining in the Tipico Restaurant. Despite the fact that there were very few other diners and a lot of staff on duty, the service was poor but the a la carte food was very bad and not worth the wait. We were a large party of a dozen, which was obviously a challenge but the food was not well cooked and two people sent theirs back because it was cold. At least we found that the microwave worked. The staff did not respond well to our gentle complaint nor did they reduce the bill, they smirked as we left.I would definitely stay here again but would dine out each night."
Jun 2017,40,"Nice hotel, would stay again","Stayed here in June for a local event and found the hotel to be very nice.  I was on a morning arrival from the airport and they were very gracious to let me check in early. The room was very nice, clean, well-appointed.  Like many hotels in Europe, your room card turns on the power and air conditioning.   I understand that this saves energy and cost for them while rooms are empty but it would be good if the A/C could maintain some basic cooling even when the guest is not in the room.  It was very hot during my visit and the A/C unit struggled to cool the room down when I first returned at the end of my day.  The bar area is fantastic, nice couches and chairs, beautiful landscaping and very nice staff.  The turnaround time on drink and food orders out there was a bit long, they could probably increase their profits in that area by staffing one extra bartender to mix drinks.  The location is convenient to public transportation and the double decker tour buses but not very walkable to the downtown area.  Not many choices for local restaurants within walking distance though.   The hotel breakfast buffet was very good, lots of choices including omelette station.  I would stay there again."
Jun 2017,50,Excellent hotel with good transport links,"I was worried that this hotel was too far out from the centre, but the Metro is on the door step 10 mins into centre. taxis are relatively cheap and waiting for you at the door.Our room was fabulous large and clean. Breakfast was fab with plenty of choice, was a little annoyed that was offered a ""special deal"" of 18 euros and when we turned up for breakfast was told it was 20 euros because we hadn't booked ! Was quickly sorted out by customer relations with apologies. Customer relations were great with suggestions for dinner, had an amazing night at a Fado restaurant that they suggested.One small gripe charging people 2.50 euros for a swim hat for cleanliness seamed like a bit of a con"
Jun 2017,50,Metro friendly,"Have stayed at this hotel regularly, it never disappoints. Easy access from the apt, you can get the Aerobus 2 for three euros almost to the door. On arrival the staff are welcoming, the rooms well equipped with coffee making facilities. Towels are changed twice a day, the breakfast is a fantastic start to the day, also afterwards a nice pool to relax in.You can purchase one two three day tix in the metro which gives you the freedom of the metro, buses, and trams in Lisboa. Their are a few restaurants around the hotel, but SetevMares is the best.Close by the Gulbenkian Museum, Cortes Ingles and a taxi to the Benfica museum, then cross the road to the Columba shopping centre for lunch on the top floor.You can be closer to the centre, but this hotel has it all, with a great bar on the terrace with music."
Jun 2017,50,Bennett's,"Our 4 night break to this hotel was fantastic.   The hotel and rooms were very clean and very comfortable.  We upgraded to include breakfast and use of the executive lounge and that was amazing.  Breakfast  catered for all tastes and  the views from floor 24 the lounge was great.  We would like to thank Monica and Fabio  in the executive lounge for  their efficiency  and their professionalism. A special thanks to Monica for helping me find a shoe shop after my sandal split.  The hotel is about 15 minutes to centre by metro,  but the station is opposite so very easy to use.  My only negative would be the hotel restaurant,  it is trying to hard to be a 5 star rating  but the food unfortunately is not  and the restaurant manager should be addressing this.  Would I rate this hotel 5 star - yes but try and upgrade to get superb standards."
Jun 2017,50,Graduation Vacation,"The Corinthia Hotel was outstanding from the moment you enter the main entrance, you were greeted with a warm welcome and very helpful staff. The hotel is within walking distance of the train and metro plus there were taxis waiting outside if you needed one.  It is located about 15 minutes from the airport. The atmoshere is very relaxing and the smell of fresh flowers is very welcoming. This is a graduation vacation for my daughter and our room was a good size that accomodated three beds, the bathroom was full of toilettes that were restocked each day and the views from the rooms were outstanding. This is a family friendly hotel and would recommend everyone to book this hotel."
Jun 2017,50,Lovely Stay in Lisbon,A quick City break to Lisbon- The hotel is very close to the Airport aswell as 2 Metro Stations to bring you in to the center of Lisbon. One across the road from the hotel and one a short walk down the street-The staff on check in were very friendly and helpful in giving us information and the gentlemen on the concierge was able to recommend where to go for the live Music and which metro station to get off at.
Jun 2017,50,"Fanatastic Hotel, fantastic Staff - good location","Although the Hotel is not central, it's 5 minutes walking to the Metro and a 15 Minute trip to downtown. The Hotel is perfect. Rooms bright and clean and the breakfast very good. The staff is fantastic"
Jun 2017,40,Enjoyable stay in Lisbon ,"This hotel is very clean and welcoming. The staff are generally friendly and the rooms are pleasant with all the little bits you need for a relaxing stay. Whilst there isn't an outdoor pool the sun Terrace is right next to the lovely indoor pool, perfect for a dip when the sun gets too hot. You unfortunately have to pay extra for the spa which isn't too clear upon booking and was disappointing as it should be available inclusive of the price for all. The breakfast buffet is top rated and worth getting included in your hotel package. The area is slightly out of the way so not too much going on around the hotel but very close to the metro. Overall a lovely visit."
Jun 2017,40,Beautiful hotel,"I really liked staying here..The rooms are small, but well appointed.  The staff is terrific, and it's a plus that have a large beautiful outdoor space on the first floor.  Additionally, they have a pool and a spa.  The pool is indoors, but there are lounges outside."
Jun 2017,50,Lisbon city trip for 1 week,"Stayed in the Corinthia Hotel. Brilliant staff, food, accommodation. Great location. 5 minutes from metro station zoological garden. Tip take the train exit as its closest to hotel.  If you take the metro line to the airport - red line be prepared for crowding as only 3 carriages whatever time u travel. Probably better by taxi. Easy to walk from hotel to riverside about an hour through safe and pleasant neighbourhoods. Great motorcycle clothing shop 5 minutes from hotel with huge selection of clothing."
Jun 2017,40,6 night stay with 4 year old,"+ very clean hotel, all the staff were very friendly and helpful+lovely big room, lots of channels on the tv to keep the little one entertained+ very comfortable bed. - the curtains were not long enough so did not block the light, had to use eye mask to sleep- poorly designed bathroom. glass panel between bath and sink blocks access. 2 sinks which we found unnecessary but not enough area to keep toiletries.+ nice indoor heated pool, the water feels a bit cold at first+ paid spa, spotless. very hot sauna, steam room not so much. the water was taken away at 9pm which was quite annoying. we were given one complimentary session."
Jun 2017,40,Quieter Experience in Lisbon,"We enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia a bit away from the tourist areas nearer to the water. The staff was very friendly and helpful, making our stay even better. Our room had gorgeous views of the city and we could easily walk to many sites, with easy taxi rides to those further away. My only complaint was that the room did not have good storage places. The only drawers were at the bottom level of the closet underneath the refrigerator. The bathroom had a double sink (nice!), but very little room to store a make-up bag and no shelves at all."
Jun 2017,50,"Excellent hotel, well situated and fantastic staff","We've just enjoyed a 4-night stay at the Corinthia Hotel and enjoyed having this hotel as our base to explore the city. The hotel is located close to the metro (which is really easy to use) and the zoo. Check in is swift, even when the hotel is busy and the reception area is lovely. The breakfast room is spacious with the option to eat outside. All the food is delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed going down to breakfast every morning. There is also a nice bar (albeit hotel prices) but this didn't put people off and again you and sit outside on the terrace or at one of the tables inside. Staff are friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 14th floor. Whilst the room wasn't massive, it was fine. The hairdryer was in the cupboard and very few plugs available to use it. However, the bed and pillows were very comfortable. You can hear some noise from other guests and there may have been some room refurbishment going on as there was the sound of a drill for a couple of days but this didn't distract from the overall feel. The pool is nice as well. Clean and well maintained. You do need to wear a swimming cap - although some guests didn't and this rule didn't seem to be enforced. Overall a great stay and I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The staff really do make you feel very welcome and have high customer service standards. Muito Obrigado Corinthia Hotel!"
Jun 2017,50,Christmas in Lisbon,Magical stay. We chose the club option because of children who could eat / relax in lounge space . Chef/male waiter there extremely helpful with requests. Visited world heritage sites from here by hired car. Memorable sites.Great pictures. Must get local Portugal app to navigate directions-accurate.Near hotel is a zoo /art gallery which we loved. Stay for New Year sale on 2 Jan at El Cortel -multi storey branded sale- get a tourist card at info desk for discounts and take Vat reclaim form for the airport. Look for roasted chestnuts-delicious/seasonal. Careful with restaurants-don't expect too much.We had two bad experiences and stuck to the hotel restaurants-safer . Algarve drivable from Lisbon - coastal experience-slow down the pace and relax here.My family loved friendly Portugal.
Jun 2017,40,Good standards,"5th stay in a corinthia hotel..Good location next to the metro.The breakfast is extremely nice. Choice is massive, fresh products, lots of local products for savoury ( cheese, ham, sausages) and deserts ( custard tart and other cakes) . You can experience in the morning what is offered in Lisbon's restaurants.Swimming pool nice although not too big. Room really clean, service from staff excellent.The only negative point, ask for a room away from the lift as they are quite noisy.Definitely recommend this hotel."
Jun 2017,50,very nice hotel,"Very nice room, comfortable bed and friendly staff. Very good room equipment and free wi-fi. Variety of food and drinks during breakfast. It was a big pleasure to spend 4 nights in this hotel. My next stay in Lisbon will be in this hotel, for sure."
Jun 2017,50,Wonderful hotel ,"We stayed for 5 nights for a family city break, we stayed at 15 th floor in a very nice room, comfortable bed and pillows , organized room with all the facilities. Tasty breakfast with a lot of choices and friendly staff . We recommend this hotel ! The only minus was that we didn't have the chance to upgrade for the lounges rooms ! Maybe next time !"
May 2017,40,An excellent hotel,"We were very pleased with the hotel, its staff and services.  Our suite was comfortable, well equipped and the access to the executive lounge was an added bonus, which allowed us to spend time resting and admiring the view from the 24th floor."
May 2017,50,Excellent hotel and very attentive staff,"This time I had an Executive room with access to Executive floor. Open from 7:00-22:00,  the staff is helping in every need, very polite, with separate breakfast buffet and service, snacks coffee and drinks until closing. Breakfast quality and variety in the regular breakfast restaurant as well, is very good, hotel public areas very friendly with a ""well being"" feeling."
May 2017,50,Make sure to book an executive room for superb views and great benefits,"We had the most wonderful stay here in April. The rooms were very comfortable with wonderful views over Lisbon - across to the viaduct, the Tagus and suspension bridge. We had decided to upgrade our rooms to executive and were so pleased we did as, as well as the higher views, we had access to the Executive Lounge on the top floor, where a great buffet breakfast is served (the chef will prepare eggs for you to order and in your preferred style) and drinks and snacks are available all day, including hot snacks around 6pm. In addition, there is a separate check-in desk for Executive Club, which means no queuing.The staff were very friendly. knowledgeable and helpful - nothing was too much trouble.Beds were large and comfortable. Bathroom was very well-fitted, with a powerful shower, decent-sized  bathtub and bidet. Loved the non-steaming mirror! Good quality toiletries and other useful items were provided and renewed. Proper coffee machines in the rooms too.The hotel is less than 5 mins walk to overground station and metro. Bus stops are about 5 mins away, right by the zoo gates.Taxis into the centre cost around 7 Euros and will be hailed for you by the doorman.All in all, we were very pleased that we had chosen the Corinthia and would stay again without hesitation."
May 2017,50,"Made the Holiday,","My wife and i have just finished an excellent  10 day executive club stay, my 4th stay at this hotel over the years . and we will be most certain to return. the Staff we found to be so helpful,professional and friendly in their interaction with you . the food was excellent  the Club bedroom was both clean ,well serviced and quiet,  the staff can not be praised enough for the  multi cultured role that they have  to deal with each day. their smiles are infectious  thank you Corinthia hotel Mr. Mrs David Mason"
May 2017,50,Amazing Hotel,"Loved the location - Not too close to the old center but easily accessible by Taxi (which are not expensive). It is also only 10 minutes by taxi to the airport.The hotel is well maintained and has a really nice outside terrace bar. The common areas are expansive and well ventilated (given that Lisbon can get hot in summer).The rooms were very comfortable, cleaned nicely and upto a really good standard. All of the staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly and I always felt welcomed here. The door man gave us a great tip for a grill restaurant in the center and there were always Taxi's outside 24/7.The breakfast buffet was huge with an excellent selection and of high quality. There is really nothing I did not enjoy here!!A little tip a few hundred meters across the road and to the right is a little supermarket which sells some nice Portuguese wine at good prices!"
May 2017,50,Perfect Hotel,"Recently visited Lisbon for a long weekend and we picked the Corinthia Hotel as it was offering a special deal at the time.   It is a beautiful hotel and everywhere is very clean and spacious.   The staff were friendly and ensured our stay was a happy one.The restaurant is very good and the quality of the food very high, although it is a bit on the expensive side.   We actually dined in a restaurant around the corner for most meals."
May 2017,50,Great hotel with perks!,"We loved our stay at Corinthia Hotel!  We were lucky enough to have access to the executive lounge - with an amazing view and amenities!  Our favorite thing to do was to go up to the executive room in the evening, as the sun was setting, for drinks and watch the planes land.  The staff were superb - always friendly and attentive.  The workout room was fantastic (I probably should have worked out more often to offset the treats from the executive room 🤣)!  While not close to downtown, we used the metro or Uber to get to where we wanted to go.  My guilty pleasure was the nespresso machine - drank my share of cafe!  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it!"
May 2017,50,Loved this hotel!!,"Spent four nights on the 23rd floor of this wonderful hotel prior to embarking on sa cruise. Our room came with executive lounge access, and I cannot stress enough that this amenity - concierge, fab breakfast, afternoon cocktails/wine/beer -is well worth the extra!  Our room was beautifully appointed and clean with a very comfortable bed.  Hope we can stay here again on our next trip to this beautiful city of Lisbon!!"
May 2017,50,Fantastic hotel,"This hotel is probably the best I've ever stayed at. The main reason for this is the attentiveness of every single member of staff. They personalise the experience for you, it was my birthday and the they went above and beyond to ensure I had a great time. I had an executive room which included breakfast and access to the executive lounge, which is well worth the price and had amazing views of Lisbon. The hotel is not in the city centre but it's honestly not far. The metro is really simple to use, alternatively taxis are inexpensive. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Lisbon and should I have the opportunity to go again, I'll definitively be staying here."
May 2017,50,Perfect hotel,"It was my first visit in Lisbon , lovely city , staying at the corinthia Hotel of Lisbon made my stay even better, Ioved it , i will say it was a great break , staff very good , lovely hotel , the service was great and Daniel at the executive lounge was great . I will be back for sure at this hotel and I will recommend it highly .I stayed from the 18 th to the 21 st of may 2017."
May 2017,50,Fabulous Hotel,We recently visited the Corinthia Hotel in Lisbon to celebrate our 47th wedding anniversary we travelled overnight on a sleeper train and arrived a lot earlier than our booking in time. We were welcomed by the most friendly young lady at the executive club desk who said it wasn't a problem arriving early she sorted out our reservation and then arranged for our luggage to be stored until our room became available. She then took us to the executive club lounge and on route explained the facilities in the hotel. On arrival at the lounge we were introduced to the staff and directed to the seating area where we were offered refreshments. Throughout our stay (4nights) the level of service we experienced was outstanding and better than anything we have ever experienced in our years of travelling around Europe. Overall probably the best hotel we have had the pleasure to experience. I would also like to mention Daniel one of the members of staff in the executive club lounge his personal attention to customer service was nothing short of brilliant and what an asset to the Hotel they should be proud of him and all the other staff who between them made our stay so memorable.....BRILLIANT
May 2017,50,Luxury stay in Lisbon ,"Stayed one week for business in Lisbon, the hotel has everything you can ask: fully equipped fitness center, swimming pool, extended breakfast, nice personnel and elegant rooms.The only drawback is the location: good for me to get quick outside the city to the office, but far away from the city center. Considering taxi rates and a metro station very close, not an issue."
May 2017,30,Good but don't use the restauarant,"The rooms are very pleasant. Clean with all expected bits and bobs.It is sometimes possible to get an upgrade to the executive lounge at no extra cost if you keep your eyes open for deals. The executive lounge serves breakfast and has a running nibbles and drinks buffet going all day long with a view of the city.The gym is well stocked and seemed clean even though there were no wipes or sprays available to wipe down equipment after use. The concept 2 indoor rowing machines are in a poor state needing servicing and bungee replacement.The reception staff are OK. They will book stuff for you but their recommendations are not always that great.There is a shortage of leaflets or information about trips etc available.Breakfast is good  - in both the dining room and the executive lounge. The Restaurant is awful. Do not go there. The food is not tasty in any way and totally overpriced. This applies to starters, mains and puds. You can get twice as good for half the price downtown. The service was also awful. We had a party of 14 and there was only another 4 diners in the place (says it all really). The location is not great. It is not a walking distance to town and even if it was, about half the walk is not at all interesting. The taxi fare downtown is 10 euros approx - which is pretty cheap for the distance. However it is just a pain to have to get a taxi when you want to go out every time.The yellow open top bus tour has a stop near the rear of the hotel and the tickets last for 24 hours. The tour is fine - once you get to downtown."
May 2017,40,"Good hotel, a bit far out ","We stayed two nights at this hotel, and the hotel itself is very nice, with excellent and very helpful staff. The rooms were adequate in size, we were high up and at the back so got a good view. The hotel is on the flight path, but the sound proofing is excellent and we didn't hear the planes, however if you are sitting outside in the bar you do.From the airport it's about 10 euros or you can get the metro which is pretty easy (red line to San Sebastián then 2 stops on the blue line to the zoo). I would recommend buying a day pass covering tube and bus for 6 Euro. We had a great stay, but there were 2 minor points that people should consider when booking, then make your choice1. Location - this is a bit out of the main town, 7 stops on the metro so about 15 mins. The service was good, so it didn't really affect us, but some might want to be closer to the town2. Spa cost: we knew the hotel was a bit out, but we wanted a hotel with a pool and a spa. The spa was very expensive 50 euro for one hour for a couple to use the jacuzzi and Turkish baths (that said it was lovely). Also remember to take a swimming cap for the pool, else you will have to buy one.We didn't eat at the hotel but the food did look good, we preferred going into town where is just so much to choose from.Overall we would recommend this hotel, especially if you want a pool and a spa as in the centre I don't think you would get this."
May 2017,40,Wonderful hotel ,Attended a business conference here for 4 nights and I have to say I enjoyed my stay. Rooms exceedingly comfortable well laid out and shower facilities very good.However the rooms have the absolute bare minimum of power outlets. None near the bed. So difficult to charge devices. Wifi was very good all over the hotel. Food was good. Service was good. Great hotel except for power outlets.
May 2017,50,Pleasant stay ,"Stayed her for three nights. Situatayed within 2mins walk of Sete Rios train and metro station. Brilliant links into the centre and surrounding areas. Room was lovely. Service brilliant. Clean rooms. The bar has a nice atmosphere, a little expensive for food and drinks but nothing we didn't expect. The pool was out of action for the duration of our stay due to maintenance however not an issue as we were given access to the spa which is just beautiful. Very friendly service from the bar staff. Apologies to the lady who was evidently new working in the bar on the Wednesday evening as she was pounced upon by another English couple staying who insisted she was thoroughly trained as she made a few mistakes. Don't take it to heart.  All in all a lovely relaxing stay in a very smart hotel."
May 2017,40,Very nice & comfortable Hotel,"Rated with very high qualifications, this Hotel didn't let us down. Very well located at the end of the Liberty street, nearby main attractions of Lisbon, was so easy to reach. Rooms were so comfortable,  very good service from bilingual staff, vast and delicious food available at the buffet breakfast helped out to make our stay an unforgettable trip."
May 2017,50,So nice,Love how friendly the staff are. The rooms are clean and tidy and pretty much anything you'd need is available. Food was nice as well. Both breakfast and room service 👌🏼with so many options. Really impressed
May 2017,50,Very good hotel,"Hotel is very good. Rooms are very clean, very comfortable bed, great shower,  there is a small minus - there are many people who hardly understand and speaks english, but this is generally happening in Lisbon"
May 2017,50,Great breakfast ,"The hotel is good and the breakfast selection is amazing. It is pretty well located, close to the zoo and only some steps away from the metro station. The pool 🏊🏻 is open from 6.30 am on so you can exercise before going to work or getting to know the city. The Gym is 24 hours open 👍"
May 2017,40,Comfortable and elegant,A comfortable hotel close to the blue line metro which takes you into the heart of Lisbon.All necessary amenities including gym and swimming pool.A little expensive and pretentious for Lisbon and where it is situated but worth a go.
May 2017,40,Very smart hotel,Rooms are large and very relaxing. Good location for the metro into the centre of Lisbon.Staff are helpful and friendly and the food is very tasty in the bar.Would certainly return if im back in Lisbon.
May 2017,50,Excellent Hotel with Amazing breakfast,"Arrived after an overnight flight from Toronto. Fairly close to the airport- about 20 mins by taxi. Easy check in and very nice room with a super comfortable bed and amenities . Friendly helpful concierge booked us a great tapas dinner spot in the heart of downtown-Taberna Tosca. The included breakfast Buffet was outstanding , including an omelette & fresh Prosciutto carvery stations!Getting downtown was a 15 min cab ride.I would certainly return in the future."
May 2017,40,Nice Hotel shame about the lifts!,"Stayed at the hotel for 3 days during a sales conference.The hotel is located about 20 minutes from the Airport and a short trip from the city centre.The welcome, checkin, facilities and rooms are very good, restaurant (for breakfast) served great food! Unfortunately the lifts are very frustrating - swipe card, press the button and wait for your allocated lift to arrive. It took me nearly 30 minutes to go from the ground floor, up to 22 to my room and back down again.Otherwise it's well worth considering for a stay."
May 2017,50,Really Enjoyed the Hotel ,"Let me start by saying that the location is a bit away from the town or central but they are a mere 100m away from the metro station which .is most convenient and suitable to me , I preferred staying away from the central area as I found this hotel great value for money and it was upmarket .The rooms are large and adequately equipped , you couldn't ask for me for the price you paying , the breakfast was awesome , I really enjoyed it .Great value for money and will highly recommend this property ."
May 2017,50,"Great hotel, great location","Great hotel, beautiful room, very cosy, great staff, amazing food. Very close to city centre and right near subway station. It was a 4 min walk (if so) to the subway and it takes you right to city centre. Everything about the hotel was positive."
May 2017,50,Good location to the Metra,"We upgraded to Executive level. Well worth it. Excellent experience. The staff was so helpful. Our room was very clean. Felt safe in the area. Able to walk to the Metra, easy to get anywhere. Great choice."
May 2017,40,A nice surprise,"Relaxing and luxury hotel. Clean facility, friendly staff. Taxis right outside. 15 mins from airport.Reasonable rates. I have simple needs, they provide conditioner! Beds v comfortable. Loads of soft pillows! Breakfast fresh and tasty"
May 2017,40,Very comfortable break,"Room spotless, bed oh so comfortable, great pressure in the shower with nice complementary toiletries. Staff all very friendly and accommodating. Food in restaurant and bar was very good. Only 4 stars due to the charges for some of the leisure facilities which I would not expect from a hotel of this standard."
May 2017,40,Almost perfect,"The good: having the opportunity to upgrade reasonably to a level with included access to the Executive Lounge on the 24th floor where Monica and Daniel treated us like royalty.  The room was lovely and large with a beautiful view of the aquifer and the Tagus River.  The Executive Lounge offered breakfast and beverages and snacks throughout the day.The bad: drilling noise in the walls during two of our four nights that definitely affected our enjoyment of the space.  We called and were told the noise would stop ""by 6 or 7"". The second night (our last) they offered to move us to a different room.The ugly: compensation for the two evenings of noise (2nd and 4th) was to send a bottle of port and two pastries to the room at  9 p.m.I would have expected more!Would I stay there again?  Probably............"
May 2017,30,Not bad but....,We had access to the executive lounge....which was not bad. But we both thought the breakfast selection was pretty average. Also.... You have to buy a swimming cap to use the pool.... And to use the jacuzzi or sauna it's €50 per hour!!! See attached price list.   Its not even an amazing spar. Its such a shame that hotels make u pay for what should be included.
May 2017,50,Wonderful service,Friendly very helpful staff. Good wifi. Spacious inviting lobby. Attractive rooms. Great linens. Wonderful shower. Fantastic breakfast buffet.  Easy travel to historic parts of Lisboa. Upper floors have panoramic views. Could see to 25 April bridge.
May 2017,50,Superb hotel in Lisbon,"Absolutely wonderful hotel. The staff, amenities and views are first class. Sitting on the Terrace Lounge was like being in a quiet oasis within a major city. Beautiful landscaping, including a water feature, made the experience peaceful and soothing. The Tipico Restaurant is first-rate with old-fashioned European service (and fabulous food). My husband and I had a delightful stay."
May 2017,50,Loved the pillows and the views,"Great interior lobby and the Executive Lounge has very nice view of the city (view over the 18th century Aquaduct). There were varieties of snacks and refreshments. Breakfast at the Executive lounge was very good. I loved that there were different types of fruit juices as well as fresh fruits. But I think it would better not serving the same types of food every days. On the fourth day, I just didn’t feel like having breakfast.Location wise, it is a bit far from city centre but we wanted to stay away from hassle and bustle but not too far to travel, so it was good location for us. Metro is just around the corner and more or less 10 mins to the city centre. Also the airport is 15 mins away but we didn’t hear a thing from our room.The staff were very attentive and friendly. The room was good size, clean, large bathroom and plenty of storage. I love the pillows there. I think they are the best I ever slept in. Plus the swimming pool was amazing."
Apr 2017,50,An excellent hotel in Lisbon,"Most hotels are nice in Lisbon but this stands above the others. The infrastructure is excellent, the gym, spa, pools are incredible and the hotel restaurant serves good food. The rooms are also very comfortable and spacious.  Everything works as expected. The only improvement I'd suggest is the front of house who are nice but come across as quite arrogant / quite aloof"
Apr 2017,50,Holiday visit to Lisbon,"I went for my first visit to Lisbon with my friend and stayed at Corinthia fr 8 days. This hotel has a nice location between the airport and the old city center and can be reached from the airport also by underground, that has a station (Jardim Zoological) next to the hotel. Also 3 different buses have their stop outside. Also taxi is reasonable price.This hotel offered a very nice room with all conveniences. It was clean and cosy. The bath towels were thick and big, the way I like it.The hotel has a pool and sun veranda with all possible spa services. Also the outdoor terrace and garden were very nice and comfortable.The staff all over was excellent and took so well care of us. When staying several days everybody seemed to know us and greeted us cordially.The breakfast has a separate price. In case you wonder to take it or not, please do not hesitate. Just take it! It is so good and a big variety of everything to eat. I really recommend to start your day with the breakfast."
Apr 2017,40,Great hotel for visiting Lisbon,"After visiting the Algarve for many years we booked this hotel for our first  visit to Lisbon. We thought the location was excellent being slightly away from the centre of the tourist areaas in the City Centre . it gave us the chance to leave the hustle and bustle behind when we wanted to. That said access to the downtown area was easy - a taxi ride cost between 8-10 Euros and the metro station just across the road gave easy access to all areas of the downtown area (cost around 1.5 Euros per person per trip.The hotel itself was excellent, the facilities were great including a very nice spa and swimming pool area with a secluded terrace for sun bathing.The inclusive breakfast was also very good and included a wide range of excellent dishes as apart of the buffet. We also had bar snacks in the bar area which were very good too.Finally the staff could not have been more friendly or informative.I would highly recommend this hotel"
Apr 2017,40,Good Place to stay,"We booked this hotel as a base for a long weekend city break. The staff were warm, friendly and very helpful. The hotel itself is a business hotel and has all the trappings that come with such a hotel. We had a superior room which was fresh and clean and had all the amenities you need.Although we didn't eat in the restaurant, we did have some tapas out on the patio. They were to die for!Breakfast was a bit expensive at 20 Euros each but you did get a large choice with it. There is a Metro station close by which takes you into the centre of Lisbon is about 15 minutes. It is worthwhile to buy the daily travel card that runs for 24 hours from the first time you use it. You can renew it at any time close to the expiry time and it will add 24 hours on to any time remaining on the ticket. This ticket can be used on the buses, trams and the metro.I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
Apr 2017,40,High Quality Hotel,"Smart comfortable hotel with lovely clean bedrooms. Efficient helpful staff. Quick check-in, good lifts, nice bar, wonderful swimming pool. But food and drinks and hotel parking are very expensive.Quite a long way out of the centre of Lisbon so either a long walk of public transport needed."
Apr 2017,40,"Very comfortable and spacious, great outdoor water garden/ terrace","We were using the hotel as the starting point to our first visit to Portugal. We arrived late from the UK so booked the hotel so that we could do some sightseeing the next day before heading off to the coast for the rest of the trip. finding it was easy and it is very convenient to the airport, with good insight parking. We traveled into Lisbon the next day using the Metro which was very close and convenient. The rooms were spacious and clean, and the communal spaces were all airy and light with loads of areas to congregate and relax. The breakfast was good with lots of choice hot and cold. We had a couple of drinks at night in the bar which were good, great service, but the drinks were slightly over priced. We drank these on the really nice outdoor area, which is well manicured and includes a waiter garden feature. Nice spot, great for a short break in Lisbon, just watch the price of the drinks!"
Apr 2017,50,Exceptional Hotel,"My wife and I have written many reviews regarding this hotel, we stay so often because we have received such wonderful service on every visit. The Corinthia delivers on all aspects as expected from a 5 star hotel and although not in the centre of the city as with all cities the attractions are spread over a wide area so having a metro/rail/coach station within 300 metres, a taxi rank on site, bus stops all around including sightseeing buses transport is not a problem.We have booked our next stay in July bringing our visits to some thirteen weeks over two and a half years indicating our total satisfaction with the the Corinthia."
Apr 2017,50,Great weekend with kids,"I stayed with 2 kids and it was a lot of fun (swimming pool and everything) highly recommended. And there is a nice Portuguese seafood restaurant nearby. Kids enjoyed the staying, the pool, the breakfast and people in the desk were very helpful (they had discounts for aquarium tickets)"
Apr 2017,50,2nd visit and still fantastic,Fantastic hotel fantastic staff. It was our wedding anniversary and the staff could not do enough to make sure our stay was perfect and it was.  My husband was poorly on the second night of our stay and cannot fault the staff of the executive lounge. They were attentive without being intrusive. Will I go back absolutely.
Apr 2017,40,Ideal hotel for conferences,"Good hotel for business trips to Lisbon, slightly out of the city centre but offers reasonable comfort. The room had a fridge, safe, tea and coffee making facilities, flat screen TV and work area. Food was quite good too."
Apr 2017,40,Great hotel but disappointing Easter Sunday Dinner,"This is a lovely hotel to stay at and I recommend you try it.  It is close to transport and walking distance to the zoo.  Rooms are great and security is outstanding.We were so disappointed with our special family Easter Sunday dinner which we had pre-booked at 7pm when the restaurant opens.  On arrival our table was not ready - even though we were the first to arrive!  It then took an hour for our meal to be ready and then three out of 6 meals were lukewarm and a fourth was cold!  We declined to come back at 9pm and ate the cold food!   How is it possible for the first customers to arrive to be served lukewarm food?  Quality control does not appear to be monitored.Service was not good for a 5* restaurant.  The restaurant manager offered us an insulting 2 bottles of free water!  We then had to see the duty night manager who after some time agreed not to charge us for the four meals which had been added to my room bill.  When we left only one meal was free so we had to then get the day manager to amend the bill, causing us all stress!  BUT the location and the hotel are lovely so if you eat elsewhere at a fraction of the cost, you will have not problems!  However every breakfast was of a good quality and we were pleased with the consistency of good breakfast food."
Apr 2017,40,"Wonderful hotel, great staff and venue","On a recent business trip I stayed for 1 night and the hotel itself cannot be faulted. On arrival the staff were very helpful and efficient and checkin was smooth and quick. Although a deposit of €100 blocked on my card was steep. The room was lovely and a good size however lack of plug sockets (only 1available beside the bed so not good if 2 people in the room) only worked when the light was on. So to charge my phone beside my bed I needed the light to be on. The hotel is in the immediate flight path of the airport and so early morning I was woken up by the first flight of the morning. Breakfast was wonderful and plenty of choice with the option to sit outside in the sun with a waiter based outside to provide coffee to us at our tableCheckout was smooth and efficient. A tip if you don't carry cash is that taxis don't take credit cards so uber is better for this purpose All in all, I would definitely return."
Apr 2017,40,Excellent hotel,"Good location - a bit out of centre but very good metro link. High standard 5star hotel, very comfortable rooms, good service, excellent hot and cold breakfast buffet, including nice table of local specialities (cured hams, cheese etc), egg station. Attractive open air bar terrace, though bar and restaurant prices high. Did not have time to try spa facilities!"
Apr 2017,50,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed for 5 nights and we really can't fault this hotel.  We got a really good deal on an Executive room which gave you access to the Executive Lounge on the 24th floor.  We decided to use the Metro from the airport and it was a doodle, apart from lugging your case up the stairs.Once we had checked in we were slightly disappointed with the room to be honest, thought it may have been a bit bigger and the carpet was a little tired looking.  However the room was spotless and the view over Lisbon from the 21st floor is spectacular.Although you are a fair way from the centre the metro system is awesome and you are literally 2 mins walk away from the nearest station and 15 mins from the centre of Lisbon.We tried to lounge before heading out and we were greeted by Guillherme who is the credit to the hotel.  So polite and courteous, he explained everything and always went out of way to ask what you had done that day or plans for rest of your stay. The breakfast could be taken in the main area on the ground floor or in the executive lounge which we preferred, really busy downstairs.  Excellent selection which sets you up for the day.The pool was great and was nearly empty each time we went, didn't get time to use the spa.All in all it is a fabulous hotel and we would love to return some time, definitely recommended."
Apr 2017,50,Luxurios oasis in a beautiful city,"We came back to Lisbon after our 5 day stay in Fatima, and Corinthia Hotel was just a 5 minute walk from the Rede Express bus station (besides the Metro). We stayed for two nights and it was truly an experience of a luxury hotel. We booked months in advance, so we got a good offer for a double room (parents and a young teenager). A few days before, we got another good offer to upgrade to a junior suite, and once in, it was wow! The suite was on the 23rd floor (the 24th top most floor is the huge Executive Club) with a panoramic view of the city. The queen-size bed was so big and firm, we could all comfortably fit (and had the extra bed taken away), and watch the sunset, or the TV (cable with so many English channels and programs and pay-per-view movies), or our iPads. There was a dresser with chair on one corner, and on another corner was a real classic office desk and chair (with plugs for all electronic equipment) and shelves in the wall, then in a wide space was a big couch, two chairs and a table. Even the entrance was roomy. The suite had ample cabinets, safe-deposit-box, mini-bar, complete coffee/tea maker/set, and even an ironing board/set. WiFi was strong and free. The toilet/bathroom had a toilet and bidet on one corner, then two washbasins complete with toilettries, then a bathtub with a glass-wall and shower. The hotel has many amenities (indoor/outdoor pools, spa/wellness, gym, lounge, etc) which we didnt have time to experience. Just entering mainfloor was a spacious and luxurios lobby with places to sit down, a well-manned reception and porters to welcome you, a huge bar/coffee-shop, a big restaurant for lunch and dinner (which we didnt experience as we went to several restaurabts just nearby the hotel or to El Corte Ingles), and the huge restaurant for breakfast, which opens outside to a beautiful terrace with dining furnitures and parasol. Corinthia is well-staffed with friendly, helpful and efficient personell. He hotel serves sumptious breakfast buffets, so good and bountiful all I have seen over the years (only thing missing was the sparkling wine to accompany the smoked salmon or even the sardines:-). Truly a luxurious oasis!"
Apr 2017,50,Lovely stay,"Went for a weekend to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Hotel is 10-15 mins in a tax from the airport, but the metro is 2 minutes outside the hotel if you want to save money and was equally just as easy. Our hotel receptionist was extremely welcoming and helpful showing us all of the main attractions that Lisbon had to offer. Our room was very clean and spacious. View was quite nice too. Our room did not include breakfast, but we opted to try it for 20 euros each. There was a lot of choice for the food, but both of us were disappointed with the quality of the food which was a shame so would recommend going to a cafe outside of the hotel or in the main town.The pool and spa are beautiful; very relaxing start to the day going for a quick dip before a day of exploring. However remember to bring your swimming hats or they are 2.50 Euro behind reception!! Our favourite part of the hotel was the outside terrace. During the day, we loved spending an hour or two outside in the hotel terrace with a beer in the sun. You completely forget you are in a city!! All in all the hotel is beautiful and would definitely recommend!!"
Apr 2017,50,Affordable luxury,"Whilst the hotel is not in the centre of Lisbon, there is a metro across the road and you're in the centre in just 10 minutes. This makes the hotel much more affordable. We stayed in an Executive Junior Suite with access to the Executive Lounge and it was wonderful! The staff were all very friendly, very helpful and we really enjoyed our stay. We would definitely stay at the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon again."
Apr 2017,50,Wonderful hotel,"From the moment you arrive this hotel oozes class. Having upgraded to a Junior Executive suite we had access to the Executive lounge which was well worth it! The whole hotel is spotless, both in the communal areas and the bedrooms. Reception staff are very helpful and all have excellent English."
Apr 2017,50,Over the top service from Concierge Vera,"We had left some important medicines at home in Denver.Vera, at Concierge desk, made some calls and actually walked us to a nearby clinic where we were able to obtain Portugese prescriptions to rescue us.  Vera was in all ways friendly, diplomatic and effective.  Many Thanks!"
Apr 2017,40,Nice hotel ,On arrival 1st impression of the hotel was very clean and service good. Rooms were clean and the maid called every day to change towels etc. The food in the hotel was nice but very repetitive and alcohol was very expensive. The hotel has a nice patio out the back which is good but apart from that there is not much around the hotel to see. However you can take a taxi to the centre of the town for around €6 and lots of nice restaurants and bars here.
Apr 2017,50,Fantastic Hotel!!,"My husband & I spent 3 nights in this amazing hotel at the beginning of April. The hotel is not in the centre of town but metro just across the road takes you straight in. Journey takes about 10 minutes. Booked an executive suite with access to the executive lounge. The room was spacious, clean & had amazing views. Found all staff to be polite, courteous & helpful espesially Monica & Guillian in the Executive Lounge. Pool was lovely as was the Spa. Would definately return to this lovely hotel."
Apr 2017,40,Lisbon anyone...,Well this was our first trip out of the US with our little one.  We couldn't have picked    better place.  In booking this hotel I wasn't thinking proximity to down town (comfort for kid first priority).  There is a metro station across the street which made it easy to get anywhere we wanted.  The room was spacious and clean.  They supplied a crib for us which was a plus.  The most important thing to us is the quality of the food and customer service.  The in room dinning and the restaurants in hotel were real good.  The customer service is what did it for us.  The staff was friendly and in top of everything we needed. Only knock is we couldn't get the thermostat to work correctly.  Otherwise we had a pleased.
Apr 2017,50,Luxury from the moment you step in...,"We arrived at the hotel in the morning before check in opened, they gladly took our bags and we ventured out to explore the surroundings. This hotel is a good downhill 45 minute walk from central Lisbon. It is in the more business district of the city as opposed to the more tourist area. This is good and bad, if you want to be in the centre of everything then this is not the place to stay. However we very much enjoyed the trip and enjoyed the leisurely walk into the city as we got to see more than just the tourist hot spots. The walk is scenic but quite hilly, you can get a taxi for around 10 Euros if you want to save your legs! We had a room on one of the top floors which had a good view out, nothing to spectacular to see but it was nice to be higher up. The room was fairly spacious, not as big as other Corinthia hotels we have stayed in but adequate for the couple of nights we were there for. The rooms were immaculately clean and very modern. The hotel bar is nice and relaxed in the evenings with live music, quite expensive, be prepared to pay around 15 Euros for a cocktail, around 10 euros for a glass of wine. In the local vicinity of this hotel there are a couple of nice Japanese restaurants that we visited and we were very impressed with, just a 5 minute walk outside. Walk another 10 minutes and there is a large shopping mall and a lovely green park with a lake and fountains. Not heaving with tourists as it is a way out of the centre so a nice chilled place to go. We very much enjoyed our stay and would stay again!"
Apr 2017,50,Liked this hotel a lot!,"Spent 4 nights in two rooms with interconnecting doors which was ideal for a family of 4.  This proved to be excellent value as the room rate was not doubled.  The children really appreciated their own space, bathroom and not having to sleep in roll away beds as is the case in most other hotels. Thank you.  This is much appreciated.  We did notice in Lisbon that adult rates start at 12 years for most tickets and attractions.The welcome was warm and genuine and gave an excellent first impression.  All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.  The concierge on the door was a gentlemen and very helpful in asking where we wanted to go and ensuring the taxi driver's knew our destinations.  The ladies on guest service were delightful and helpful. On their advice we went to the zoo next door and used the 15% discount voucher.  We also purchased our big bus tickets and had no problems redeem the voucher on the bus.The quality of the rooms did not disappoint us. The bed linen was good quality and the mattresses were exceptionally comfortable.  There was no corridor noise.  The bathrooms were well stocked and the showers powerful.We all enjoyed the breakfast buffet and even the fussiest eater enjoyed the omelets which were freshly made to order.  A good selection of  fruit, cheese, chorizo, breads, pastries, waffles etc ensured we had a hearty start to the day.The hotel is not in the historic centre of Lisbon but the overall service and standard of accommodation made up for this.  We calculated it was cheaper for a family of four to catch a taxi (around 7 euros) than buy individual metro tickets.Our city break was very successful and a lot of this was due to the customer service we enjoyed at the Corinthia."
Apr 2017,50,Lovely Lisbon,"A wonderful hotel, great staff who were very welcoming, helpful and friendly.  Our room was a good size, excellent bed, modern furnishing and quality amenities (esap toilietries) like Nespresso in the room"
Apr 2017,40,Easy access,"We spent four nights at this hotel, we found it very good for getting out and about, metro station nearby , approx 3/4 minute walk, the hotel has an elegant look once inside, I like the security aspect of it, you have to use your room card to access the elevators, made us feel safer, fantastic breakfast, sets you up fir the day, good size swimming pool on second floor, the spa area is beautiful, could have spent a lot if time there however as it was I got dragged everywhere and only managed to spend the last afternoon indulging myself,Good hotel, have a look, you won't be disapointed."
Apr 2017,50,Great hotel and excellent location ,"My family and I had a great time here during the holidays. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the hotel is impeccable with large rooms and great facilities. The breakfast is excellent, with a variety of local delicacies and delicious omelettes made to order. There's a large underground station around the corner and the zoo is a few steps away. I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Lisbon."
Apr 2017,40,Spacious and friendly,The hotel and the staff made us love Lisbon and wanted to come back again.  Rooms are spacious and clean. Bathrooms are full with excellent water pressure. We loved the double vanity which made it very comfortable for both my husband and myself to have our special time. Breakfast buffet is amazing.  Last day of our stay coincided with my 60th Birthday event and I was rewarded with the perfect chocolate cake after a delicious meal at the restaurant.  This hotel and Lisbonians and even taxi drivers make us insist on visiting Lisbon again.  Lovely amazing city with great people and wonderful hotel
Apr 2017,50,Great Hotel for a family city trip to Lisbon,We have been on a city trip to Lisbon and Porto and stayed 4 nights in Corinthia Hotel. We had book to double rooms with a connecting door as a family package. It turned out to be he ideal solution. Rooms were on the 19th floor with great views. The room design is modern and very comfortable. Breakfast was also very good and we especially enjoyed the outdoor bar/lounge after long city walks. Staff is very friendly and everything was as we expected it. Jardim zoologico Metro station is nearby and connectivity to everywhere within Lisbon is fine. Thanks for a memorable stay.
Apr 2017,40,Not as Good as Others,"We stayed at the Budapest Corinthia and had a thoroughly lovely time so when we were coming to Lisbon decided to stay at Corinthia. We had a Junior Suite deluxe and the room is lovely, spacious and good amenities. The housekeeping is very good and our room was spotless each day. The breakfast has a large selection and is fresh and very tasty, one of the highlights of staying here.The view from our room was nothing to write home about unless you like buildings and a main road! In fact you are better off saving some money and having a cheaper room as they are on the higher floors. The location is not fantastic as it is 7 Metro stops from the town centre. The staff are pretty good but unlike other hotels we have stayed at the staff here it seemed were helpful in a professional and formal manner, it was not the friendliness we have experienced before.   In summary, it is a lovely hotel, and the service is good, but I cannot say we would return there. It felt more like this hotel is aimed at the business market rather than people on holiday."
Apr 2017,50,Amazing Second Stay,"Having visited Lisbon and stayed at this hotel 4 years ago we decided to return to celebrate our wedding anniversary. From the moment we arrived we have been once again made to feel very special. We were upgraded from an executive room to a suite. In our room was a complementary bottle of champagne, cakes and chocolate covered strawberries. The spa team had given us a complementary hour in the aqua spa making this a very memorable trip where we have truly been spoilt. Monica in the executive lounge has been amazing helping us sort out our days activities. Walter makes the best omelettes and pancakes and Daniel makes us our perfect pot of strong tea with hot milk. Location of the hotel is perfect as it is close to the metro at Jardim Zoologica on the blue line making getting around Lisbon easy and economical. We have 2 more days left of our week long stay...I'm going to miss being here and miss the staff who've made our stay so memorable. We will definitely be back."
Apr 2017,50,A Reat Hotel,"We arrived quite tired,and we were  made most welcome,our room was large,comfortable and spotlessly clean.The bathroom was large and well appointed.A large very comfortable bed,desk,safe,well stocked and very reasonably priced mini bar. The public areas varied and comfortable,the bar area was most pleasant with a lovely terrace at the rear. What made this hotel memorable were the staff,who were always friendly and most helpful,nothing was too much trouble"
Apr 2017,50,Faultless and fantastic,We stayed at this hotel for three nights mid week. We booked on expedia and on arrival were ushered to a separate check in desk and advised that we were the guests of the day and would be upgraded to an executive suite. We were completely over whelmed with how friendly all the staff were and of course the upgrade. The suite was spectacular on the 22nd floor - really good sized and everything you would need in a room (except tea/coffee facilities but no problem)The bathrooms were luxurious with Elemis products. The view over Lisbon was spectacular.We had access to the executive lounge - really useful after a day of sightseeing to relax with a coffee or glass of wine. We also had access to the Spa which was extremely high standard. The indoor pool was also a good size with plenty of loungers and a door taking you outside to  a terrace which was a real suntrap. Location was fab - we knew it wasnt in the centre and it really is not a problem. As everyone has said metro is just over the road - direct line to centre takes 10-15 mins. The airport was just a ten minute and ten euro cab ride away - so convenient. We did a day trip to Sintra - rail is very easy in Lisbon it really is the easiest city to get around. Thank you Corinthia for a fabulous stay
Apr 2017,40,Good value and comfortable hotel near public transport,"One of the good things about this hotel is that it is very good value for decent sized rooms (one of the benefits of being out of the city centre). The rooms were clean, spacious and well equipped and the (good sized) indoor pool and spa facilities were a nice way to relax before heading into town for the evening. The metro station (Zoological Garden) is only a few minutes stroll from the hotel and it only took 10-15 minutes to get to the action in the centre of Lisbon (or 30 mins and one looks me change from the airport)."
Apr 2017,50,Luxurious accommodations outside of tourist district,"The Corinthia is by far one of the nicest hotels in Lisbon.  Everything is exceptionally clean, the rooms are actually nice for European standards, beds comfortable, and the staff truly has customer service down right.  It is a popular hotel for business travelers but as tourists we really enjoyed being on the outskirts of town away from all the tourist/downtown bustle.  While the lack of proximity to downtown may be a deterrent for some travelers, the hotel is adjacent to the metro which is super user friendly & takes no more than 10-15 minutes to get to all the popular stops.  We loved taking our time and walking into downtown Lisbon (~2-3 mile walk) each morning.  Also, it is a 10 (10-15 euro) cab ride from the airport.   I highly recommend upgrading to the Executive Club Level - not only did our room have an incredible city view on the 21st floor but access to the lounge pays for itself without a doubt.  It includes a full breakfast with hot and cold options as well as an Omelet station.  The staff are super attentive and make wonderful coffee beverages.  The remainder of the day has a good selection of snacks, appetizers, non-acoholic beverages, wine, sparkling wine, and beer.  We also ate at the hotel bar one evening where Miguel the bartender let us sample a bunch of different wines and the food was delicious (even better than some other restaurants we dined at in Lisbon).  We would stay at the Corinthia again in a heartbeat and our experience was so positive that we look forward to visiting their other locations."
Apr 2017,50,Just fabulous,"Everyone at the hotel were polite, friendly and always willing to help in any way I need. The location is really close to the centre of Lisbon, amazing zoo where anyone can enjoy hours of pleasure and excitement.The confort of the rooms are second to none. On top of everything, the view from the rooms it's breathtaking.It's a place to go and comeback for more."
Apr 2017,50,Fabulous Stay,"We have just returned from our 3 night stay at the Corinthia. We had booked our stay to celebrate my husband's birthday via Expedia on a fantastic deal .Our plan was to use the hotel as a base to allow us to explore Lisbon , and didn't opt to upgrade from the superior room with a queen sized bed . We had absolutely no regrets the room was very well presented and equipped and gave us everything we needed. The attentive staff and their attention to detail was a credit to the hotel.Unfortunately, we didn't experience the spa or restaurant as we just didn't have enough hours in the day to take advantage of them .The location is as agreed in many posts is not city centre central, but the superb Metro & Train links were great . Ps Patisserie just a few doors along from the hotel does an ace croissant & coffee to go for the 15 minute metro to the city centre .Thanks guys for helping to make our weekend so memorable 😀"
Apr 2017,40,Comfortable stay ,"Well presented, good quality hotel with great service. Fantastic ambience, with good access to the train and metro stations. Close to the Zoo and so the city tour buses pass close by. Had couple of minor glitches but overall stay was comfortable. Strong free WiFi. Credit cards accepted including American express."
Apr 2017,50,Vacation ,Amazing hotel!!  Friendly staff and great amenities.  I stayed 4 days and opted for access to the executive lounge which offered a comprehensive breakfast with made to order omelettes and snacks/drinks throughout the day.  The train/metro was less than a block away which provided access to city center - less than 10 minutes away.   The lobby bar provided live pianist and an appealing wine list/menu.  The spa is also worth checking out.  Sofia and Daniel exemplified customer service.
Apr 2017,40,A comfortable hotel,"We spent 3 nights at the Corinthia.  We were fortunate that a room was ready for us when we arrived before noon, after an overnight flight.  The hotel is comfortable, with windows that open and an ample breakfast buffet. The major negative to us, was the location. It is not in the center of the city but on the periphery.  There are several nearby restaurants, so that was convenient."
Apr 2017,40, Nice Business Hotel,"Good alternative business hotel in Lisbon - very friendly service, nice rooms, good food. Overall a good option if you're for business purposes in Lisbon and you don't know where to go. Will consider it again."
Mar 2017,50,"If you dont mind the location, this is your place","The best hotel i have stayed in Lisbon. We booked executive room (business trip 😜) and we had access to the executive floor (24th). It was a nice place (similar concept Of VIP rooms in the airport) but in the 24 th floor with views at Lisbon. And I was lucky because I was upgraded to a suite and it was absolutely fantastic. And the last but not the least important.... the breakfast is incredible!!!! Variety and quality of food. I only missed apple in the fruit and a smile of the ommelete cook, he didnt say Good Morning. Its no so difficult!!!! It has an area of chill out/bar with music in summer in the ground floor. It was a pity not going to the swimming pool..."
Mar 2017,50,Nice Hotel,"Stayed here in March 2017 for 4 nights.From the moment we stepped out of the taxi we were surrounded by the staff helping with the bags, escorting us to reception, efficient checkin followed by them showing us the way to the lifts, showing us how they operate and finally to our room.Had great views from the 19th floor of the city and aircraft on approach to the airport, but no noise.Nice room with huge bed and an unfogable mirror in the bathroom. We had two small problems with the room both sorted within 10 mins.Lots to eat at breakfast, however hot food was never hot just luke warm.Well equipped gym and a huge indoor pool.Found staff attentive and always willing to help.Metro and train station within 200 metres of hotel. The 24 hour ticket for about 10 euros is great value and takes you almost everywhere you would want to go. We spent a day in Sintra and another in Caicais.Hotel probably built in the 80's, early 90's and the decor reflects that style. Prices in the bar reflect 5 star rating.Really nice stay and would recommend this hotel."
Mar 2017,30,Good Hotel although not too central,"Stayed here for a week and hotel was satisfactory. There is a metro very close by which  takes you all around the city. Not much eateries around the area at night which are opened. So best to eat in town before you come back to the hotel at the end of the day unless you want to eat in the hotel which is a bit overpriced.The only thing we were not happy with was that after a 10 hour long flight, we arrived 3 hours before check in time which is 2pm. I asked if they would check us in early as we were very tired and my wife who is pregnant did not sleep well in the plane. They said that they could for a fee of 50 euros to check us in early! It was 3 hours to wait and so we left the luggage there and went out for a bite and came back and sat in the lobby and waited. What ""excellent"" customer service!For a couple of nights. the room's air cond was not cold either. It was blowing out heat although it was set to cool. We had to crack open the one window that would open a litlte to cool down the room. i did call reception to inform thsi and the girl said that she would inform a tech to look into it but nothing was done. in the end we just shut the unit off and left the window open."
Mar 2017,50,Love it,"Lovely hotel, fantastic staff and such a good location! Quiet and classy. The food is amazing and the staff extremely helpful. And the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Metro very close by, easy access to all the city."
Mar 2017,40,Nice hotel not in the centre,We stayed for one night as a family with a 2 year old. The hotel is in between busy roads not in a picturesque area. We drove from the Algarve and the hotel was easy to find just off the a2. There is parking at 18 euros a day or parking on the street if you can find a space.Staff are great and very helpful. We took our 2 year old to the swimming pool paid 5euros for swimming caps to stay in the pool for 5 minutes as the water was too cold. When I mentioned this to the spa staff they replied try another day maybe warmer! Rooms are nice although on the small side are very cosy and comfy and have everything you need. Breakfast was good and lots of variety. We ate in the restaurant in the evening it was fine I would recommend going back into the centre. There are a few restaurants around the hotel. The metro is across the road and it took 10-15 minutes to get to the main area. It was an easy journey This was a very nice hotel but next time I would stay in a hotel in a more central area.
Mar 2017,40,Great Experience!,"This was our first visit to Portugal. We arrived at the hotel before check in and was extremely tired from flying 12 hours. The hotel staff was extremely professional, and offered us early check in, which  was greatly appreciated, we were able to shower and take a well needed nap. The room was spacious with a nice view. It is not downtown, but only about 7 minutes away by taxi. Would definitely stay here again."
Mar 2017,50,Very nice medium size hotel,"We had a company meeting of about 400 people at the hotel and all stayed here.  Rooms were really nice, comfortable and functional .  Conference facilities worked very well.Food was overall very good .  Omelette station could move faster Hotel is a bit outside or at the edge  the city center but closer to the airport .Overall well recommended"
Mar 2017,50,WOW!,"amazingly stunning rooms, you wont be disappointed. the pool area is nice and relaxing just outside the spa , very nice. nice décor all around hotel, the bottom floor bar and outside area is very modern and up beat. the hotel have these amazing mirrors which don't fog up after a bath or shower. lovely beds."
Mar 2017,50,Fantastic Hotel,"We booked this hotel for a 5 day stay in Lisbon, the hotel is located outside of the old town but is opposite a metro station, it takes around 10 mins to get in to the centre. There is also an overground line at the station. The hotel is very close to Lisbon's zoo. The hotel is modern, well equipped, clean and the staff are very friendly. From the moment we arrived our stay was very special, the staff have a fantastic attitude, nothing is too much for them. we upgraded to the executive junior suite, this gave us a very spacious room plus access to the lounge, this was a real bonus as this provides all day drinks, snacks and breakfast. The staff in the lounge are fantastic and very helpful, giving advice and making bookings.We also used the spa, this is one of the biggest in europe and offers a wide variety of treatments, these are on the pricey side, but look out for the special offers which we took advantage of and had a great experience. There is a pool and gym open to all residents, both are ok - note take a swimming hat otherwise you need to buy one.Food wise, the hotel is good and as there is little locally it;s best to eat there, the nighly buffet is good value, but I preferred to jump on the metro and enjoy the delights of Lisbon.It's hard to fault this hotel, if you want to experience the old town or dont like a small commute then this is not a hotel for you, otherwise stay a small distance out and experience a great hotel."
Mar 2017,50,Beautiful,What a beautiful hotel and staff.The front of house staff are so friendly and so very helpfulThe location is perfect for the metro link.The gym is well equipped with modern machinery and the pool area is well maintained with loungers and towels.The rooms are well equipped and spotlessly clean.I would definitely book a city break using this hotel/ location again.Well done all !!!
Mar 2017,50,Very nice.,"Nice, clean,convinient location hotel. Very nice spa also. Good restaurant but a litlieHe expensive. Helpful stuff. Nice view from the room. If you smoke, they have a smoking floor. Ask for a smoking room."
Mar 2017,50,Excellent service for business travelers,"I attended a conference there, and to save money, three of us shared a room. Even the rollaway bed was quite comfortable, and we still had plenty of room to move around. We were all jet-lagged and one of our group had never traveled outside the U.S. before. The staff was very professional even when dealing with annoying questions. And, yes, the chocolates were excellent."
Mar 2017,50,Super hotel,Great rooms and very nice staff. The staff really makes you feel welcome.We loved the pool and spa facilities. The fitness room had a lot of machines and work-out stuff. Great breakfast buffet restaurant - I couldn´t see anything missing in a complete breakfast meal.
Mar 2017,50,Staff go above and beyond,"The hotel Corinthia is situated in the heart of Lisbon's business centre, but it is certainly not JUST a business hotel. My partner and I wanted a relaxing break from our busy schedules and were not disappointed one bit. I cannot commend the staff enough on their superb attention to detail and upmost courtesy. Some would say this is what you should expect from a 5 star establishment, but the team here at the Corinthia Lisboa really do go above and beyond. They surprised us beautifully when we returned from a day trip to Sintra on my other half's birthday: When returning to our room we were greeted with a bottle of bubbles and a chocolate cake. No idea how they figured that one out. The ice was still fresh in the bucket when we walked into the room, you can imagine the commitment and rush that happened behind the scenes as we made our way back through the lobby - Amazing. I never even asked them to surprise her, they just wanted to make us happy, and it definitely worked. A few things I'd like to highlight: the bar staff here really know their stuff, they deserve their accolade of the best bar team in Portugal. We were very well looked after by Rodrigo and Miguel, who's knowledge and passion for their drinks and profession makes you really appreciate your experience that much more. A jazz pianist also makes for a wonderful touch in the lounge bar every evening and the concierge team delivered on all our requests with great efficiency. By the time we had to check out we didn't want to leave. Everyone made us feel at home, and we are not your typical 5 star guests, but we were really treated like a king and queen.If you are looking for a romantic hotel to have a truly memorable experience, don't be put off by the location, you're a stone's throw away from the metro and trains, 15 minutes into the Bairro Alto or 30 to the old town of Alfama. We were in Sintra in under 50 minutes - or if you prefer to be lazy, the porters will kindly get you a driver. As much as you may want to be in the center, the gorgeous view of Lisbon from the higher rooms is far more worth it in my opinion."
Mar 2017,40,Good location,Very nice hotel. Overall very good experience. The staff was very helpful and very nice. Amazing view from our room. Plenty to choose from frukostbuffen. There is something for everyone. Maybe a little disappointed when it came to bread. A little dull.We will be very happy to return to this hotel
Mar 2017,40,Great business hotel,Stayed in the hotel during one week for business when attending a conference in the hotel.Accommodation is great and rooms are of a decent size. Breakfast is very good and there is a wide variety of choices available.Can recommend the hotel to others and will be back next month.
Mar 2017,50,Fantastic!,"Highest praise for this hotel.Location: Two minutes from the local train station with metro links.Staff: Very knowledgeable, helpful, the best staffed hotel we've been at. Room: Large, incredible views of the aqueduct and 25 Abril Bridge, high finishes all round, has everything you need.Food: Room service food, very high quality and the restaurants downstairs even higher. Buffet restaurant in the evening has the best meat I've had.For our sons 1st birthday, we called down to guest services to ask for some matches to light the candle we got for his custard tart. They came up with a huge chocolate cake for him with happy birthday written on the plate and some apple juice.This was so nice of them and really made us love the Corinthia.Brilliant time, perfect hotel."
Mar 2017,50,"Fantastic Hotel, located 45min walk from centre.","We stayed for 2 nights in a King Room on the 16 floor. It's a Corinthia Hotel so of course everything will be polished, cleaned and you can instantly become absorbed by the luxury. The hotel is located quite a way from the centre and it's a good 45minute walk or 15 minute taxi. Taxi's are cheap with a €15 price tag on a trip from the hotel to the famous Pateis De Belem. - which on another note you must visit as the Pateis De Nata are genuinely the best.It's around 15minutes from the airport and the costs was approx €17.We are big Corinthia advocates and will always choose the brand. I must say though that this particular Corinthia didn't ooze the level of opulence as some of its sister hotels, like London or Budapest.Gym is well equipped with a good  selection of cardio and machine weights. They offer daily classes too. Swimming pool was a great addition and you will need a swimming cap to use. Charged at €2.50 at the spa.If you head out of the front of the hotel and walk right you'll find a selection of restaurants and cafes, however you'll want to head further into the city for more selection. There are also options at the back of the hotel including Japanese and Vegetarian.Would choose the hotel again based on the Corinthia brand, not on location."
Mar 2017,50,Great business hotel with fantastic staff,"Excellent staff, truly world-class: helpful, professional and attentive. Good location, comfortable rooms. Conference facilities were excellent. Catering was very good (the Portuguese offerings at breakfast were especially appreciated!)."

Mar 2017,40,"Good location, great breakfast- beware late check in","After flying to Lisbon all we wanted was a hot shower and a nap. We arrived at 10 am-despite a large group checking in without issue -we were told our room would be ready at 2 pm. There was no offer of a changing room, or a temporary room to shower and change (as one is given in Australia ) nor did the front desk even offer to take our luggage in case we wanted to venture out. That said- make arrangements for an early check in where necessary.The hotel is about a 15 minute ride from the airport (7-9€ Uber) and a 3 mile walk to the water- easily done- great local flavor on the way- main shops and restaurants on the route. Wear VERY comfortable shoes as the sidewalks are cobblestone. The zoo is also quite close.A day trip to Sintra is an easy train ride from the hotel- the castles are fabulous and the train station is conveniently located across the street.The included buffet breakfast is expansive yet unchanging. It gets a bit tiresome by weeks end but provides a full meal to start the day.Rooms have limited outlets for hairdryers and the like. Adapters are necessary for US travelers. Iron and board delivered upon request. In room safes and small mini bar/fridge provided.The elevators provide great security- though initially tricky to operate- I recommend watching a fellow guest as the front desk does not provide instruction.The night manager, Andre Gois, works 21:00-09:00 and is wonderful. I suggest emailing him with special requests or needs. All staff speak Portuguese and most speak English.  Don't speak Spanish- they aren't fansOther great day trips are Our Lady of Fatima and Porto ( we rented a car and did both 08:00-24:00) but arranged trips are available. Faro is a chic resort on the southern coast and is either a 3 hr train ride from the station discussed above or a 40 minute flight."
Mar 2017,40,Great hotel but still something to improve!,"We spent a weekend in this hotel and we really enjoyed our stay. We had a room on 20th floor with the access to the Executive Lounge. Executive Lounge has amazing views over the city. Breakfast was served from 7 to 11 am and after that there was food and drink in the lounge until 22.00. Breakfast was excellent and had a choice of buffet together with freshly made omelettes and crepes which were delicious. All the personal in the hotel from people in the reception to waiters and chefs at breakfast are very professional, friendly, helpful and make you feel really welcome. Our room was nice but small, very comfortable beds and beautiful view over 25 abril bridge. Unfortunately I cant give a 5 star rating to this hotel  no matter how great were all the above mentioned things. Upon check in, when we went to our room, I've noticed that the bedding was dirty, had holes in it and what was the worst there were someone's hair on the sheets and the bedding. It looked like the bedding was not changed after the previous guests. This is is unacceptable especially in the 5 star hotels. I reported this issue to the reception and it was resolved but still the overall impression about the hotel was ruined by this."
Mar 2017,50,Perfect for weekend away or business trip ,"Hotel can be easy reached from the centre of Lisbon (10 min journey by metro and 15 minutes by cab from the airport). The main restaurant offers menu with traditional Portuguese dishes as well as international cuisine. You can also have a breakfast or snack in the lounge on 24th floor and enjoy panoramic views. There are also a few restaurants near by, where locals dine, and a grocery shop, less then 5 min walk. 5* for comport, service and the atmosphere."
Mar 2017,50,Amazing Hotel.,"We stayed here for 2 nights as a short break.  Great customer services and an amazing hotel, breakfast was buffet style and had lots of variety to choose, however evening meal was pricey and a bit disappointing.  Rooms were very clean and very comfortable.  The hotel itself was amazing, very impressed, used the swimming pool which was a nice added bonus.  Overall a fantastic stay"
Mar 2017,50,Good 4* hotel in Lisbon,"We lost a flight back home. Yeaaahhh! We could spend money in Portugal! Found a good deal for less then 100 Euros for the night for a small but nice room with a big marble floored bathroom. We checked out the spa and gym and it looked fine. Receptionist Miriam treated us very lovely and also the guy in the restaurant was very friendly even though we ended up going next door to the cheap but wonderful jap restaurant that has vegan sushi, as the very nice looking buffet in the hotel has no heart for vegans.. We arrived after 8 and left before 6, so no idea about the location otherwise the fact that it is right next to a metro station. I will not come back, as Lisbon has a lot of nice hotels that I will wanna explore in the future, but our stay was very nice!."
Mar 2017,30,Above Average at Best,"I am a big fan of the Corinthia brand. This hotel however wasn't up to par with the brand. The hotel is very nice and the interiors are beautiful but it was just another nice hotel NOT a Corinthia. I stayed for 3 nights and I complained multiple times about the AC not being cold enough and every time I was promised that the problem will be fixed. They didn't offer to change my room and when I expressed how horrible my stay was, the manger stepped in and offered to have a fan put into my room. Bottom line, nice hotel but instead of the Corinthia name maybe just call it another above average hotel chain."
Mar 2017,50,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed the last weekend in February, lovely hotel, very helpful staff, great room - we were at the back so had views over the bridge, viaduct and city and it was amazing. Everything you would expect from a 5 Star hotel (including the prices!!) but would recommend to anyone.  Only drawback not much going on around in the evenings outside the hotel, would be livelier in the old part of the city if that's what you're looking for."
Mar 2017,50,Amazing experience and staff was great,"I have been visiting places around Europe, and Lisbon has been on the list. I had the chance to find a deal with an absolutely great price for a 5-star hotel like the Corinthia is. I was reading a few comments regarding the fact that it should have 4 stars, what I can say is that my overall experience was fantastic. The room given, though as said I got a deal, was very big. As well as the toilet with a massive shower and two taps. In terms of cleaning, the standards were very good and I can't complaint. We also experienced the indoor pool, which was nice and very quiet (a quick note: the head cover is compulsory, if you plan to use the pool I would recommend to bring it rather than buying it there). Finally the staff was very nice and seemed available throughout the stay. What else can I say about such a nice hotel where I hope to head back in the future?"
Mar 2017,50,Um descanso de luxo,"The hotel is lovely, very close to the subway, well located in the city and the staff was the nicest. The view is beatiful. One of the best 5 stars I know. I'll be revisiting this summer, when I'll better enjoy the pool and spa."
Feb 2017,50,5 star ,"One of the nicest hotels I've stayed in. It's impressive from the outside. It's impressive from the inside. So clean. So modern. So professional. The hotel is a little out from the city centre but there is a metro stop within 5 minutes walk and only costs €1.45 per trip and the line takes you into the heart of Lisbon. You need to change once if coming from the airport. Check in was friendly and straightforward. My room was spacious, clean , modern and luxurious. The bed was comfortable. There's a mini bar, a safe, tea/coffee making facilities , everything you'd expect in a top class hotel. Didn't use the pool or spa facilities. Breakfast was amazing, everything you could think of that could be on a breakfast menu was on it. The food was excellent quality also, not just plentiful. It's buffet style but well laid out so no big queues. I honestly ate so much I skipped the metro and took the 70 minute walk into the heart of Lisbon (Avenue de Liberdade/Bairro Alto) to take away the guilt after breakfast. I would 100% recommend staying here if you want luxury when visiting Lisbon, don't be put off by the fact it's a bit out from city centre. It's only 15 minutes on a very efficient and regular metro."
Feb 2017,40,Luxury hotel,"Beautiful hotel. Staff are very polite and helpful. Rooms are well appointed, spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. Added to that, the breakfast was excellent. I particularly recommend the waffles.The bar is nice but ridiculously pricey. It's a fancy hotel but still! The location is a bit out of the city centre and while a nice area, is very quiet, but the metro is close by at least. I imagine it would be the perfect stop for a business trip."
Feb 2017,50,Wonderful service ,"Have just returned from a fabulous stay at The Corinthia Lisbon. The hotel is lovely and ideally located, very close to public transport.  I would highly recommend opting for the facilities of the executive lounge which is situated on the 24th floor . The views of the city are wonderful, especially at night. The best thing about the hotel was the amazing staff. Each person we met went out of their way to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and looked after us really well. I would like to mention Daniel who attended us for breakfast.  He was so pleasant  and made us feel we were his only guests. All of the staff at reception were equally excellent but a big thank you to Monica who advised us for our trip to Sintra. I  will definitely be back! Thanks to all at the Corinthia Lisbon for a fabulous stay."
Feb 2017,50,Wonderful from start to finish,"5 of us have just returned from a fabulous girlie trip to Lisbon. We had Executive rooms in the Corinthia, for 3 nights. It was wonderful from start to finish. We'd previously stayed in the Budapest hotel - another gorgeous hotel - so we knew we'd be well looked after here. The Exec lounge in Lisbon is better than Budapest - it's quieter, and more private, and the staff is amazing. We felt like celebrities because the staff was so pleased and delighted to see us every time. (We were looking around to check if there were any famous celebs behind us!) They spent time getting things right for us and giving us great tips on things to see and do. We were able to have full breakfast buffet there every morning, with omelettes and pancakes made to order. Thank you particularly to Daniel, Monica and Sofia with whom we had the most contact, although all staff were friendly, helpful and cheerful. Seems like the Corinthia found a whole pile of very cheerful people to work there!The rooms are not huge, but they are really comfortable, and pristinely clean. (But a bit hot at night) There's a mini-bar, and Nespresso machine although we never used them. We loved the little touches such as a plate of custard tarts left in our room, and chocolates in the evenings. One of our friends had her birthday on the day we arrived, which Sofia noticed from her passport. When we arrived back after dinner that night, there was a bottle of bubbly, 5 glasses, and a chocolate birthday cake complete with candle and matches! We didn't use the pool, but it looked beautiful, with plenty of loungers around. We had a look around the thermal suite area, which was small but lovely, but didn't use that either. Thought it was a bit expensive (€50 per room for 2 hours) as we'd had free use of the one in Budapest. We wouldn't have used it for more than an hour anyway, as we'd so many other things to do and see. It was deserted except for one man using it. Maybe it would be more used if it was free - even if only for Executive rooms. We were shown the spa treatment rooms, and they are very well fitted out, with an extensive and varied range of treatments available. Also a bit on the expensive side for us. The hotel is right across the road from the Metro and train station, so it was really easy for us to get into town, (7 stops) or out to Sintra. The Travel card is amazing value!! €13 credit did us 2 or 3 trips every day, and the return trip to Sintra. Taxis are cheap too - big taxi for 5 of us cost less than €10 from the hotel into city centre. The airport is very close to the hotel - less than 15 minutes (not sure about rush hour though) and there's a bus stop behind the hotel. Also, from this bus stop we were able to get onto the Yellow Bus, blue line tour. The ticket was €16 and lasts 24 hours for hop on, hop off. So - although the hotel is not in the city centre, it's 2 minutes or less from any transport connection you need."
Feb 2017,40,"Sorry, Not this Corinthia","Am staying on 11th floor in family room.  What do I think? Not as beautiful, luxurious or that absolute attention to detail as Budapest or London ( please visit Corinthia Budapest -you will never want to leave )! London is also super worthy os every one of its 5 stars - should have more!I just feel that my first impressions tell me that there is little attention to detail which makes a hotel truly 5 star. Why no turn down service or little chocolate on my bed or relaxing music playing when I returned to my room in the evening? Was my family room too cheap? I don't need these things by any means but I want to feel that I am being looked after.The quality of the bathroom fittings is poor regarding the toilet, Plastic and nasty.No plug near the bed.No digital clock - attention to detailWhy oh why is my room not worthy of a Nespresso machine ? I have stayed in Radisson hotels which were 4 star and had a machine - find this strange. Hospitality tray is lacking. Why no cups? Why only cheap IKEA mugs and no hotel crockery? Am I picky - Yes I am but We are all paying high prices and we all, as consumers ,expect the best and in my opinion, this is not the standard of a luxury hotel.One more thing, 4 people, 2 rooms, 14  clothes hangers between us, really, we are here for one week.On a positive note, rooms are large, communal areas very nice and staff so far are well mannered and helpful but sorry, this time , for me this falls short of a 5 star hotel, perhaps a very nice 4.Will visit Corinthia Malta in June... Can't wait to compare."
Feb 2017,50,Fantastic Honeymoon Destination,From start to finish this hotel was the best hotel I have ever stayed in. With excellent travel links close by it is definitely a good hotel for exploring Lisbon. The breakfast was superb with freshly cooked omelettes and eggs. All the staff made us feel extremely welcome. The bedrooms were flawlessly clean - the suites are out of this world. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend. Thank you for making our honeymoon memorable.
Feb 2017,50,This is a must,"One of the best hotels I have stayed at. First class staff and very relaxing. We had three nights. Excellent buffet at evening. Being 14th Feb great Valentine's Day buffet. The executive lounge first class with very obliging staff and helpful.,Not enough time to make use of the pool and spa. Thank you for a very interesting visit."
Feb 2017,50,Amazing! ,"Just returned from a fantastic 3 night stay in an executive room with club access. Staff are wonderful throughout hotel and the attention to detail is fantastic. Great location near metro and train lines for trips. Room was spacious with very comfy beds. Executive lounge was fantastic with great selections of snacks and drinks all day and amazing service from all staff; including a wonderful breakfast chef, who prepared delicious crepes. Could not recommend more highly."
Feb 2017,50,Mother-Daughter Trip,"We had an excellent stay.  The metro was very close.  I wish we had taken it from the airport, but it was suggested in trip advisor to take the bus.  The bus never came in the 30 minutes we waited, so we took a cab.  The hotel is very nice.  We had a small suite on the 14th floor.  It was very comfortable for my daughter and I.  We also felt very safe.  The breakfast buffet the hotel offered was wonderful."
Feb 2017,50,Fantastic weekend,"Stayed in an executive suite with lounge access. Large room with all facilities though beginning to look a little tired in places. Lounge was an area of calm in a busy hotel, with unlimited snacks and drinks all day. The service from the lounge staff was exemplary, with special mention to Daniel, whose intuitive, unobtrusive service and attention to detail could grace the best hotels in the world. Location is a little out from the centre but public transport and taxis are cheap and efficient. I would recommend this hotel highly and would return for the service alone"
Feb 2017,50,Good and quiet location ,"Visited Lisbon for a family holiday. Took the metro and it wasn't bad despite carrying luggages. The hotel is right in front as you get off, 3 minutes walk. The check-in was a breeze and hotel was quiet. The room was in 19th floor and the view was great! It's clean, and the bed was relaxing. You need a swimming cap in the pool, but the spa area is not free. I wish they could do something about the air conditioning, not cold enough and I could imagine during summertime. Didn't dine in the hotel so cannot comment. Only few restaurants near as the location is in a business district but because of the metro, we didn't mind. Overall, it was an enjoyable stay and Lisbon is a beautiful city!"
Feb 2017,40,High quality but generic,"We stayed at Corinthia Lisbon for just one night in February 2017. It's a standard 5* business hotel and I can imagine it to be perfect for a business meeting or a conference. All the facilities are in place and of good quality, staff is on point, rooms are good, location makes it hard to wander away from your business commitments. But obviously it's a big chain hotel so it's very generic (i.e. the only hint you're in Lisbon is a complimentary pastel de nata in the room) and it's very calculated (pool is free but you have to buy a pool cap, etc etc). If you're after exploring the city itself, there are far better options in terms of location, price and atmosphere."
Feb 2017,40,Very nice hotel situated within 150m of subway station. Staff all friendly helpful. Rooms clean and tidy.,"Stayed at the Corinthia 3-6 Feb. All in all had a good time but didn't try any of the restaurants, as ate out everyday.Hotel is clean and tidy, rooms much the same, though two things which I found annoying were a noisy marble floor tile which moved when stepped on and I'm not a fan of fixed head showers."
Feb 2017,50,"Excellent Hotel, either for business or leisure stays!!","Very nice Hotel maybe the best one I've stayed in Lisbon. I stayed already 2 times in this hotel on business trip and in fact it gives all you want and need - comfort, very good sleep quality, nice breakfast and accommodation. If I wanted to stay in Lisbon even for visiting, this would be definitely one of my first choices. Highly recommended."
Feb 2017,50,Great hotel,A very good hotel excellent vacillates close to airport outstanding staff can not do enough for you great base to visit the sights of Lisbon is a bit out of the way but plenty of local restaurant and bars big shopping area about 20mins walk
Feb 2017,50,The best bed I've ever slept on!,"Lovely hotel, top class.  Although not n the centre it was very near the underground so it was really easy to get about. There is a beautiful patio for outside drinking and dining but these were very expensive as you might expect."
Feb 2017,40,"Very luxurious hotel, great service, enjoyable stay but a couple of niggles",I  spent a weekend in Lisbon with my wife and daughter. Hotel is not cheap but good price for the standard. The lobby is really spacious and plush. Rooms are very comfortable. We used the modern swimming pool. Breakfast is splendid with a lot of variety.Bus 758 takes you to Cais de Sodre through Barrio Alto. There is also a metro within walking distance and the train to Sintra can be boarded from Sete Rios which is again very close.And now the minor niggles1. I think the check in systems are slow. It takes what seems like ages to do simple things.2. The air conditioning seem to want to blow warm air even though it was set to cold.
Feb 2017,30,ideal location,"We arrived on Friday morning and could either pay an extra £50 to check in early or leave our bags and explore.Having stayed at many hotels across Europe we were a bit disappointed to find that there was a charge for the spa, which wasn't worth the £50 per couple (especially when a group of 4 French people paid the exact amount!!).  Our first located room was noisy so a quick call to reception and we were moved.  Was also disappointed with the swimming pool as was told that I had shower a shower cap but when I went to watch my husband swim, none of the ladies had one on and I couldn't understand why one was needed in the pool but not the spa? hmmmm.it would have been nice also to be told that if the phone was off the hook security would wake you up (wasn't impressed especially as we'd had a very late night & the ""do not disturb"" sign was on the door).   Would I visit this hotel again, probably not............"
Feb 2017,40,Quality with a Smile,"Stayed for business in February of this year. The rooms are really nice and clean with all types of amenities: coffee, water bottle, safe, bath rope, and a lot of space. Wi-fi was good and strong in all rooms. The breakfast was complete with omelettes, fruits, breads and some local food too. The hotel is pretty close to a subway station. Staff was very friendly. Really enjoyed the time at the hotel. Fast check-in. The only thing is that elevators get pretty crowded. Will stay again."
Feb 2017,40,Nice hotel ,It is a very nice hotel clean it has a very nice sport section The staff are trained and nice both reception and services The breakfast was great you can find many kinds in the buffet  It is a good place to stay  if you have business The only  problem  for me was the location
Feb 2017,50,Relaxing Break,"We have been here many times.  We come back for the perfect staff and relaxing environment.  We had a suite on 21st floor as usual, but this time however, we were facing the side of the road and overlooking the train station..whilst the view was ok..it was however much noisier than the rear facing rooms.  The flight path was much more noticeable from this side.  The new staff we met were all lovely and helpful, Gwilliam in the Sky Lounge and his new colleague were very helpful. Monica was a happy face each morning and always had great advice of places we might not have seen.Daniel is the host of the lounge and is an asset to the hotel.  Very sharp and polite and always remembers your preferences. Perfect service. To name everyone would be fair, as all staff we encounter are friendly and helpful, which is what makes this hotel five stars in our opinion.  Domingos, Roque, Ramos and all the boys are ready with a joke or two each day.  Cannot fault the housekeeping team, always kept our room as we liked it and a ""Bon Dias"" each morning.  It was very busy whilst we were here with full occupancy, the lift system was slower so be prepared during busy times to wait and squeeze in!Overall..great stay as always.  We are back end of March so look forward to seeing you all soon. Obrigado!"
Feb 2017,40,more a business hotel,"The staff were excellent, both on the door and reception. The lobby décor was the standard of a 5-star hotel. However, the rooms were very small and there were very little of the touches that you would expect from a 5-star hotel. Definitely not a hotel for a romantic getaway.  Also, the pool was so cold as to be almost unbearable!The hotel is very handy for the metro, it is just around the corner and a 20-minute ride to the old city and the tourist attractions."
Feb 2017,30,I expected better.,"We arrived at the hotel an hour and a half ahead of check in time.  The desk personal said we could get in early if the room was ready, which it wasn't.  No problem though because we expected to wait until check in time which is 14:00.  We were advised to come back at 14:00, which we did and the room STILL wasn't ready.  Now if I was the desk personal I would have called housekeeping and informed them that we had arrived when we first got there and they could have planned accordingly to make sure our room was ready by 14:00.  But this was not the case and we did not get into our room until 14:30.  When we first walked into the room I noticed the large window and the finger prints and smudges all over the window.  Obviously it had not been cleaned that day and could have been awhile since it had been cleaned.  The next thing we noticed was the room was very warm even though the thermostat was set on 5 Celsius. I called Guest Services  and informed them of the problem.  She advised me to turn off the system and she would send a maintenance person up to check it.  After some time had passed I had to call again because no one showed up the first time.  He finally came up and said that that was the way  the AC worked and advised me to call housekeeping and request a fan, which I did. So we got the fan and opened the window 4 inches(that's all it opens).  I believe that the AC and the vent in the bathroom are controlled by the maintenance department.  I overheard a phone call at Guest services and they were complaining about the AC also.  Next the room is set up strangely.  The TV is in such a position that you can not lay in bed and watch it.  I tried to turn it to see if we could get a better view from the bed and that is when I noticed the dust behind the TV.    Next....The indoor pool is not heated and the hot tub(which was wonderful) costs 30 euros per hour.  And if you use the pool you will need to have a bathing cap, both men and women(3.50 euros purchased on site).  Next the hotel sits right under the airport glide path.  Now with the windows closed that's okay because it is double pane glass.  But seeing that the AC doesn't work your window will probably be open.  Now on to a couple of good points.  The breakfast was very good and well worth the 12 euros we paid for it.  We weren't going to get the breakfast because the original price was 20 euros each, but a few days before we came the hotel sent us an e-mail offering breakfast at a discounted price of 12 euros.  The next good thing was the king size bed.  Very comfortable!  And the last, but certainly not the least good thing, is the personal who work at the hotel.  They are very professional and courteous.  Would we ever consider coming back to this hotel?  NO!  I have had better experiences at Super 8 motels and have paid a whole lot less."
Feb 2017,30,Nice hotel with lack of details,"The hotel is nice, clean and the view from the restaurant in the top floor is amazing. However, there are some details which I expect from a 5 star hotel missing... We arrived on my birthday and even though we had to hand in our passports, nobody contratulated me on my birthday. Furthermore, some fruits at arrival in the room would have been much appreciated. However, overall, the hotel is good standard and very close to the subway."
Feb 2017,40,"Nice hotel, good location,  hospitable staff","Great hotel,   very hospitable and friendly staff. Food was ok as we were many vegetarians but nevertheless they did take special care.Their elevators have a funny logic and sometimes one ends up waiting for what seems like forever :-(Their gym and conference facilities are quite good as well, taxi right at the hotel's doorstep, etcNice place to stay in Lisbon!"
Jan 2017,30,"Conference experience, good enough, apart from one night!","I spent 4 nights in this hotel for a conference in January, overall experience was great, specially with meeting room facilities and good space management. Rooms were corect and although the amneties in the room such as coffee and tea were really at the lowest quality, i think it is what you expect from a 500+ rooms hotel. no one gets an special attention there!Like many other hotels in Portugal, there was not enough electric plugs in the room, and specially none close to bed.on the staff side, i had no encounter with them what so ever (again big hotel, you will find your way by using the signages) but i had one not very pleasant one when after a night of terrible pain and stomach troubles I contacted the receptionist around 5 am to see if they can help me with a doctor or pharmacy or whatever. I have to admit this was the first time I encountered such trouble so I do not know what I should have expected, but i am pretty much sure that an answer like ""if we call a doctor it will cost you a lot, but there is a hospital in 10 minute taxi ride"". while I did not expect a medical consult from the receptionist I am sure that in a smaller hotel of same rating you will receive much more passionate answer."
Jan 2017,30,decent hotel,"i stayed here for a conference. the hotel is modern and the rooms are comfortable. Food is quite good. however, the hotel is not in the most exciting location. I probably would not stay here were I to return for liesure."
Jan 2017,50,"Excellent venue, fantastic staff","Doing a major event here.....conference staff amazing, load in excellent, hotel staff also very good. Clean fresh, just what you need for a good event. I don't know what the rooms are like but the conference food we had during setup was fantastic.Well done to all involved"
Jan 2017,30,Disappointing,"Nothing wrong with the place- clean, comfortable, and professional.My issue was that they advertise an ""Acqua Area"" facilities, with a long list of available options including Jacuzzi, Sauna, and Steam BathBut, the website never mentions that they are PAID- unless one opens the spa brochure.I booked the hotel to get a leisurely time between flights and I expected to steam and soak for a few hours. Instead, I was told that it would cost me 30 Euros per hour to do this.  It should be clearly marked on your website- not hidden away in the spa menu, but where a typical hotel guest would see it. It was VERY disappointing. I took a bath instead.Also, I asked for a quiet room, specifically away from elevators. My room was very close to the elevators- although fortunately on a higher floor.  I heard plenty of noise from my neighbors.Finally, they have a serious shortage of power outlets in the room. I had to charge my computer on the desk chair moved to the doorway of the room... a strange solution.Hardly a five-star experience."
Jan 2017,50,Christmas trip 2016,We were surprised that we had been chosen as the guest of the day and the hotel upgraded us to junior suite. We had access to the executive lounge which was amazing. But the breakfast had much more choice downstairs (which we tried on the first day) than in the lounge (which we tried the next day). The junior suite room was pretty decent with some snacks and a tiny bottle of wine waiting for us when we checked in. We ordered from room service and the food was amazing too. Gave us a great place to stay for our christmas celebration in Lisbon.
Jan 2017,50,Nice stay,"I have visited Lisbon on two nights business stay. Carinthia hotel is located very close to underground station, where you can jump on the train 10 mins journey and enjoy the city. Lots to explore. Hotel is nice and comfortable. I liked the room and staff. I are out so cannot say much about dining in."
Jan 2017,50,"When in Lisbon, this is your hotel","I travel to Lisbon often in business and this is my favourite hotel. The rooms are clean, cosy and peaceful. I love the breakfast, the quality and details in the presentation. I also use the gym and/or pool whenever I have the time.It's home, when I'm home away."
Jan 2017,40,Nice and pro...,"Hotel is located a bit outside the city center.. you need to take a taxi for 5 euros to get to the center… Very tall building, very nice lobby, professional reception desk. The room was very nice, large, clean, a great bed, free wifi,… Breakfast is classic in such a hotel. This place is also targeting seminar and corporate events. there is also a pleasant bar, a fitness place, etc… the price is very competitive."
Jan 2017,50,Beautiful hotel with wonderful staff.,"Myself and my partner stayed for 5 days as a celebration. We were offered an upgrade to an executive room for a reduced price, and we're so happy for taking it. The sky lounge is divine. The staff remembered us by name, and remembered our preferred coffee. By the time we had sat down to eat, it was already being prepared. The breakfast itself was beautifully cooked, especially the scrambled eggs (not your usual rubbery, microwave rubbish) the selection was also very extensive. The attention to detail was second to none. The decor is minimal, yet attractive and very well put together. It really adds to the relaxed, sophisticated atmosphere that the hotel strives to achieve The selection of drinks in the mini bar was huge,  and was replenished daily by the early afternoon. The room service selection was also very large, and the chef is an incredible cook. The complimentary custard tarts that Lisbon is so famous for was much appreciated.All staff are impeccably dressed and would bend over backwards to make your stay unforgettable. It is definitely worth spending a littke extra for an executive room, the access to the sky lounge is worth every penny. The complimentary wine and canapés all afternoon and evening just topped off an unforgettable stay.My only complaint were the other guests. We were very segregated for not 'looking the part', unfortunately there are some very shallow people out there! This was by no means the hotels fault, just be prepared to have a few heads turned if you don't look minted! All in all, i would recommend to anyone who fancies a bit of luxury and we will certainly be returning again."
Jan 2017,50,A very good hotel in Lisbon,I stayed for 3 nights in a junior suite for the Temenos event. It was an excellent stay. Very nice hotel with nice common areas. Nice food and very good service. Polite and curtious personnel who were all with a big smile and a very good proficiency of english. Breakfast was rich.However we could not enjoy Sunday night football at the Bar!!
Jan 2017,50,Really upmarket hotel,"An upmarket hotel in  Lisbon. Couldn't find anything wrong with this hotel. Efficient check-in and check-out, superb facilities. Don't miss their Tapas lunch in the ground floor restaurant (Forgot the name of the restaurant)Five star service level."
Jan 2017,30,Nice but not great,"I like the Hotel pretty much, but there is also massive room for improvement. For me, the Hotel would deserve 3,5 out of 5 stars. Let's start with the good things: •	This Hotel has one of the best WIFI solutions I have experienced so far. The Internet is very fast and logging in is very easy (room number as name; last name as password). Great, that this Hotel took speed serious and made complicated passwords reluctant. In the 4 days I was there I never had to re-loggin, connection was stable. Also, watching Netflix - no problem. World-Class and a model for all other Hotels!!!•	The rooms are spacious and pretty much a Marriott like standard. With a 46 Zoll TV (slow channel Menu) and a silent fridge.•	The bed is really good - good quality mattress and pillows. (5 out of 5)•	The personnel are very friendly and helpful if you ask them. However, they are not the most attentive as you will experience at breakfast and at the bar.•	I liked the spa - pool is nice and not to cold. The gym is useable also for people who give less about cardio. Negatives •	What bugged me most was how noisy the room could get. The reason is so obviously and strange: they did not isolate the door. Whenever someone walked and talked in the hallway, I thought, that this person will be in 10 seconds in front of my bed and talking to me. I took a photo (it is uploaded) where you can see the sun shining thru a big gap, while the door is closed. I asked someone at the reception if this could get fixed, but they did not care. So, whenever other guest walked down the hallway or the room service noisily rolled along with his trolley, I was fully participating (or incorporating it into my dreams).•	Again, the personnel are very friendly but not very attentive. At the bar, it can take quite long, till you can place your order. At breakfast, you might go for the third round, till you are asked whether you prefer tea or coffee.•	While the Hotel is in general clean and in particular the rooms -> there seems to be some responsibility issues, when it comes to unconventional cases. A lady dropped a bottle of champagne in elevator ""C"", while this was swiped away within an hour, the stains remained for more than 4 days. The other occasion was close to the bar - a horrible guest puked just outside of the bar on the terrace, the big pieces were wiped, but the smell stayed.•	The cappuccino at breakfast can be described as one of the most horrible cappuccino I had in the past month. For me it tasted like machine oil found a second purpose. I am now happy, that I have not seen the machine - my assumption is, that this is either 50 years old or someone is not following the daily cleaning routine. I had it 4 times and every morning I regret after ordering it. What astonishes me, is, that responsible Management seems not try their breakfast - otherwise, I few things would change quickly, meeting international standards, I would assume. •	The fruit pieces have the biggest cut I have seen in a long time. Coffee and fruits are for me a quality gateway a Hotel has to pass, so that I would consider eating there lunch or dinner. In both categories, the Hotel failed! It was not just the enormous pieces, but also that the cut of melons was also including the not so tasty parts. In general: whoever bought the fruits did not give much about fruit quality/taste as long as the quantitative criteria was met. Disappointing - and out of the three times I could have had dinner at the Hotel, I went in one of the nearby restaurants.•	By the way: at breakfast stay away from the little round cakes. They are delicious, if you get them outside, but at the Hotel they are hard as stone and not tasty at all.•	I had very night a different cocktail at the bar. They are very expensive for Portuguese Standards 12,5 Euro up to 19,00 Euros). The taste is ok, the look is somewhat very sad. I can recall only one situation, where the cocktails looked so sad/amateur and that was in Prague, 25 years ago after east Europe just become free to travel and exotic fruits were still not available.•	The Hotel was somehow always a bit cold. That I was not the only one feeling this way, became obvious at the bar: a group of 6 French ladies and they all had their winter coats on (again, not very attentive personnel). However, if you move around and/or work, it is fine. As a guest, it might be a degree or three to low. When I read this, it sounds horrible: this is not the case. In general the rooms are really nice and the people are friendly. It is just, that, if you expect 5 star quality along with the 5 star standard, it has to be clear, that you might be disappointed. I really do not know, if other Hotels in Lisbon are better, but one things is for sure: better coffee and cocktails you will find everywhere :-)"
Jan 2017,40,Nice place. Fantastic location. Very good service.,"Cleaning room = 10; Location = 10; Subway access = 10; Reception = 10 ; Concierge = weak ; Minibar replenishment = weak ; Replacement glasses in room = weak ; General communication by site = 10. Overall, a great hotel. We recommend to our friends."
Jan 2017,50,Great birthday weekend stay,"Very beautiful hotel, wonderfully decorated and scented. The atmosphere was very relaxed even though there was a lot of people out and about. Our room was large and comfy with a beautiful view. Spa facilities were top notch and sun deck was just a slice of heaven. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Hotel location had easy access to transport and had some shops nearby. All in all, it was a fantastic stay."
Jan 2017,50,Fantastic stay,"Me and my partner had a great stay, the room was confortable, quiet and spotlessly clean. We used room service which was excellent. The hotel is very close to a couple of tube stations, only 20 min away from centre."
Jan 2017,30,Decent 80s style hotel but food is good,"Stayed there for a business conference with another few dozen colleagues. Hotel is dated and gives the impression of a 1980s establishment. Front desk service was friendly, swift and efficient. Rooms are well sized (I was on the executive floor on 20th) but could use a bit of a refresh. Mini bar was decently stocked. The inroom entertainment system was slow and pay movie system was not high quality with many hang ups and sound issues. Also difficult to control the air in the room as fresh air is pumped in during daytime and it supersedes the room thermostat. Why they do that, I don't know, but it was annoying. I had a cold and chilled air blowing on you is not a good thing. Had to get the building technician to manually shut it down. Catering / room service food was decent and the two restaurants were very good but a bit repetitive. Location is a bit out of the way but within reach of cabs and there is a train station nearby. Getting to the airport was easy and quick."
Jan 2017,50,A Wonderful Hotel,"This is our third stay at a Corinthia hotel and it is slowly becoming one of my favorite hotel chains.  The hotel is located about 3-4 miles from the center of the city but it was very easy subway commute.  The room was nice and the view was very good.  However, it is the staff that will get us back every time.  If you need suggestions on what to do in Lisbon, talk to Sofia Santos.  She provided recommendations and followed-up to see if we had enjoyed her recommendations and suggested more places to see and eat based on our experiences.  She is a gem and made our stay very pleasant.  The hotel restaurants were very good and do take advantage of two young chefs – Ram and William who cooked great food."
Jan 2017,40,Great Buffet,"The hotel is not far from the airport. We got in early before check in and was able to check in at a fee of 50 euros. The room, a king guest room was a bit small but entertainment on TV was great if you are looking to just relax in the room and watch TV. The highlight of my stay was the buffet, both breakfast and dinner was delicious. They had nice tasty dishes, really enjoyed the food. The pool was also really nice. In all, we enjoyed our stay at the hotel."
Jan 2017,50,Very nice hotel,"Lovely hotel, first experience of 5 star, didn't regret it, staff very nice, food very nice, rooms were excellent, wifi and TV excellent too. Good and drink a bit pricey for us , €7 a pint of beer, but as I say, not used to 5 star so this is probably the norm. A couple of coffee shops and bakeries on the same road offer amazing food and coffee for a lot cheaper. Location of hotel, not much around it except the zoo and the metro but the metro is so handy to use that the hotels location doesn't matter. Would visit again!"
Jan 2017,40,Elegant business stay,Hotel is conveniently located to reach airport as well as downtown. Elegant and clean it represents a very good solution for business trips. Good breackfast included in room price. Negative: available parking is charged as an extra.
Jan 2017,40,It is mostly 5 stars. It is just a couple of things which changed this...,"This hotel is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been. However, there were a couple of things that made it lose some more rating. I do still consider it a five star but I am removing one because I cannot say it was completely perfect in terms of reviewing. Everything was PERFECT and incredible except for a couple of unfortunate things. The receptionist who checked us into our rooms was not only rude but also made many mistakes. Firstly, she asked us to pay a full price for a room that already had a deposit paid. I told her a deposit was paid already and she insisted this is the price, then when I began to get my email to prove she eventually checked and said ""oh sorry, you are correct!"". She kept saying ""single room?"" ""But it's one person in other room"". I explained through email and in person already that it is a Superior Queen which was booked and that two people are using the room, not one. I had explained how the second guest would check in later. I had to repeat myself so many times and the way she kept saying single room seemed as if she was trying to get me into a smaller room than what I had paid for. If I didn't insist I stay in the superior room I had paid for, I feel that I would have been put in something smaller(if they got away with it!). Then she said she must take 100euro per room for a deposit. This is understandable that it is company policy but I said to her how we were not warned that there is such a deposit. (A couple of guests in our group are college students and it took away alot of their spending money unexpectedly.) She had a very snobby attitude and did not apologise but said ""I'm sure it's on the website""(with her eyes rolling). This check in was not very welcoming and we didn't feel respected. All other receptionists we dealt with were incredible so it's unfortunate this took away from the otherwise perfect customer service. The pool and gym are free to use and excellent. The lifts are safe and unique. The hotel is so clean and elegant. The mini bar food is overpriced in my opinion.. it was 5euro for a small bottle of orange juice and 4.50euro for a small bar of chocolate. I understand it's five star but this was a normal rittersport bar and normal orange juice. The last thing which was a problem was that we left a sign outside to make up our room one morning at about 12pm. We came back in the evening and the room had not been made up which was disappointing. But perhaps we exceeded time limit for putting sign outside?"
Jan 2017,50,Family,"Everything was perfect. Thank's a lot Corinthia Lisbon General Director and Ceo and all directors and workers. Hotel's location and service, room, cleaning ext. Everything super... Nothing negative happened. Again thank's a lot."
Jan 2017,40,Confortable average 5 star,"Nothing to say more than it's an average 5 star, room price is suited to the standing, Tipico restaurant is overpriced compared to the buffet menu, SPA services are overpriced compared to other 5 stars. Room are light and clean, staff people are kind and gentle."
Jan 2017,50,Great stay,"Probably one of the best hotels I've stayed at. I enjoyed the hotels facilities, breakfast, the room was clean and we loved the hotel smell. Very exclusive and pleasant overall. Will certainly return."
Jan 2017,40,Very nice hotel - would recommend paying for the executive lounge,My wife and I stayed here over the new year and had a very nice time. The hotel is situated a short metro ride from the city but the metro station and tourist bus routes are close by. We paid extra for a room on the 22nd floor and for access to the executive lounge on the 24th floor. In my opinion this was well worth the money. The lounge has great views of the city and has free drink and food ( soup and hot food served at specific times during the day). It was a great place to chill when at the hotel. It also served a great breakfast in the morning which meant we didn't have to go downstairs with the majority of the guests. Another highlight is the huge spa and treatments rooms it has. We enjoyed a couple of hours in the jacuzzi / sauna rooms as well as a really nice massage. I would recommend the hotel for business or pleasure. Good wifi speed too if that is important to you!
Jan 2017,30,Top Notch Service but with a couple problems,"I originally booked this property because the last hotel that I stayed at in Lisbon a couple weeks ago did not have air conditioning turned on in the room (yes, I know it's winter, but rooms can still get warm).  So, I booked a 5 star hotel (at an exceptional price) that advertised that it had Air Conditioning in the rooms.  DAY 1:  Upon arriving at the hotel, you will immediately notice that this place is nice (truly top notch), BUT the air conditioning wasn't working and was blowing hot air when turned on.  The room was really hot.  When I opened the window, the room became incredible noisy.  I tried calling to inquire about the issue, no one answered.  I repeated the call and got hung up on this time.  I figured that they were busy so I decided to call back again a little later.  When I called back the last time, I was able to get ahold of someone, and they told me that the air conditioning did work and that they would send maintenance to check on it.  I waited for a half hour and decided to quit making phone calls and visit the front desk.  I was met by the night manager who was incredibly apologetic and relocated me to a room on the opposite side of the hotel (including an upgrade to the room) where it was MUCH MUCH cooler.  I went to bed happy. DAY 2:  Not happy!  I had decided to sleep in (I hadn't got much sleep lately), but woke up before 8:30 to the sound of hammers and power tools.  I called downstairs and they responded with, ""We'll check out what's going on.""  At 9:20, I called again (since I hadn't received any answer and the tools were still banging), to which I was told again that they would look into the matter.  At 10:20 I went downstairs again and asked for help regarding the situation.  Again, the front desk manager was incredibly helpful, offered another upgrade (access to the executive lounge, breakfast, and late checkout) and reassured me that they had spoken to the workers and that work would not begin before 10 tomorrow.  I went on to enjoy a splendid breakfast and amazing customer service at the executive lounge.  Phenomenal view and service.  I am content...and a little sleepy.DAY 3:  Right about 9 AM the hammer banging begins again!  I call, get a voice on the other line who says they will check on the issue and call me back.  Guess what?  I never received the call.  At this point, who cares...PROS: Amazing service, the most comfortable bed I've slept on in a European hotel so far, nice rooms, phenomenal executive lounge and food.CONS: Terrible service (yeah, they were both good and bad...see above if you have questions), no A/C during the winter despite advertising as such, and a HORRIBLE way to wake up (unless you typically like to wake up to the sound of construction).WOULD I STAY AGAIN?  Not sure.  I was both impressed and completely turned-off by my experience there. Once you can get someone to respond to you in person, they're incredible...but don't expect any results from someone if you call them."
Jan 2017,50,Best holiday I have ever had !,"I stayed in one of the executive suites and had access to the executive sky lounge facilities. The service, food and whole atmosphere was 10/10. We have already made plans to come back ! Thank you so much ! A massive thank you to Daniel for catering to all of our needs and being so amazing. A massive thank you to Maria for providing us with such great information and an excellent service ! All staff in the executive lounge were amazing ! They all had a smile on their face and made us feel extremely welcome. This has been the best experience myself and my parents have ever had :)"
Jan 2017,50,Perfect Service,"Stayed here again in December. There have been some staff changes, but they are all very friendly and happy to please.  Rafaela and her team in the sky lounge are particularly good.  Daniel is the host of the executive lounge, and is always ready with our preferences.  We had an executive suite and was perfect for relaxing and a good space for working too. Love the bathroom with separate bath and shower. So much easier than those ""over the bath"" showers.  Great.The Corinthia Hotel is not in the centre of town, but that's its charm.  It's only 3 tube stops away of a €5 cab ride and it's great to get back to peace and quiet after a busy day in town. We are back in a few weeks...can't wait to see you all. Keep up the good work guys. 🤗"
Jan 2017,50,Highly Recommend this Property ,My family and I enjoyed a wonderful stay at this property in Mid-December 2016 and loved the spectacular views from our room on the 20th floor as well as the breakfast experience from the Executive Club Sky Lounge. We also ordered quite a bit of room service and everything was cooked and delivered to perfection. We also loved that it was very centrally located and their taxi service from the airport was superb. We are looking forward to coming back as a family and also on business. Thanks so much to all the staff we encountered and keep up the great job!
Jan 2017,40,New year,"Lovely hotel , good atmosphere on an evening in the piano bar . Only complaint , the room was far too warm and we aren't a fan of memory foam mattress ( although the mattress was quite comfortable) .good location for the train station and metro but a good walk into the city centre."
Jan 2017,50,Excellent Service,"We were hugely impressed with the service when visiting the Corinthia in St. Anton, Malta, last year and duly posted a 5-star ""Oasis of Civility and Good Manners"" on Trip Advisor.This experience prompted us to stay at the Corinthia for a short break in  Lisbon, and were pleased to enjoy the same impeccable service - genuinely warm and attentive, without ever becoming intrusive or over-familiar.We used the ""Executive Club"" on floor 24 for breakfast - it is akin to an upmarket airport lounge, with complementary snacks / light meals and wine available throughout the day.As one might expect, there are also good gym, pool and spa facilities."
Jan 2017,40,Excellent stay and very friendly staff,"Good value, excellent place when traveling with young children, clean, easily connected via subway to downtown Lisbon and close to the lovely zoo. We enjoyed it very much and hope to return soon again"
Jan 2017,50,Stay Here!,"We had a fantastic stay at the Corinthia Hotel! Located just across the street from a metro station (Jardim Zoologico), we selected it because it seemed conveniently connected to many of the sites we planned to see. The location was wonderful, but the hotel would be worth it no matter where in the city it was. The service is unbeatable- staff were friendly, polite, and eager to help. The room was big, modern, and clean, as was the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was so quiet we would have thought we were the only guests! The elevators operate only with a keycard, which adds a layer of security and peace of mind. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet immensely- great variety of hot and cold items, fresh juices, and even a local table with seasonal pastries, meats, and cheeses. The manager brought us some pasteis de nata as our meal concluded- a wonderful surprise! When we return to Lisbon this is the only hotel we will consider. Incredible experience!"
Jan 2017,50,Can't Wait to Go Back,"My husband and I spent 3 days after Christmas at this lovely hotel.  From start to finish we were treated like royalty.  I booked the hotel through Expedia VIP access and on check-in was not only upgraded, but also was randomly selected as ""the guest of the day"".  What all of that meant was that we had an executive suite on the 21st floor and access to the executive lounge on the 24th floor as well as a voucher for an hour of hydro-therapy treatment in the spa.  The prices for a 5 star hotel are reasonable and it's definitely worth the upgrade to access the executive lounge where you can relax, have a drink, appetizers, and a great buffet breakfast with a beautiful view over the city and personalized attention.  The beds are very comfortable and the extra touches, like turn down service and chocolates on your pillow made our get-away perfecf!"
Jan 2017,50,"Great Hotel, Great location","Pleasant confortable hotel.  Almost directly opposite Metro, only 15 from Airport.  Great friendly staff, especially the bar staff. Rooms spacious.  Excellent Spar treatments. Would recommend for both couples and families."
Jan 2017,50,Exelent Service to an excelent price,"It is 3. time, we are spending our New Year in a Corinthia hotel - this time in Lisboa - and the new years arrangement was perfect with very fine service.Even the band was high quality - so we were dancing into the new year 2017 !!"
Jan 2017,50,One of the best!,"Stayed five nights over New Year 2017 - having found the Corinthia from the list of Easyjet Holidays.  We have both stayed in many hotels on many continents, but the Corinthia is up there with one of the best.OK the hotel is not situated in downtown Lisbon - but it is very convenient for the Metro down to the city centre, and also the nearby Sete Rios suburban route station for the city centre - and where the very regular train service runs out to Sintra.What made the hotel outstanding for us was the friendliness of all the staff.  Not only from the welcome we received when we arrived, but also the nightly music of 'Mr.Piano Man' in the bar.    Particular credit must go to Pedro and his staff in the restaurant with their varied menu at the evening buffet.   All in all a most enjoyable start to 2017.We hope the senior management of the hotel read this note - look after your team as you have there a great bunch of professionals working at the Corinthia!!"
Jan 2017,30,Needs a Refresh,"This is rated as a 5-star hotel and seems targeted toward higher-end clientele and business folks. It was likely very nice 10-15 years ago and is now kept at a decent level but in need of an overhaul.The staff were all friendly and helpful although housekeeping did not make up our room when we went out from 11AM-5PM, which was disappointing. We were sure to request them on the following day.Room service was adequate. Again the staff were very nice but the food was nothing special and for the price, it was definitely too expensive.The biggest complaint we had was the smell of the room and condition - it smelled like a smoker lived there. Neither my wife nor I smoke and definitely did not request a smoking room/floor. However, we were definitely given one and it was not pleasant at times. There was only a small window to crack to get some breathing air though as the air conditioning didn't really work well either. Plus, we were put right next to the elevator where, you guessed it, people liked to stand around and smoke. So the smoke wafted into our room during the day, making it even more unpleasant.Overall, the condition of the room was okay but dated. Even without the smell of smoke, the comforter on the bed should be replaced with something newer; it must have been over 10 years old. And the pillows were simply alright.I thought perhaps this would be the style of Portugal over all, as it is our first visit. However, after traveling down the coast, it's clear that there are much nicer hotels around that lived up to our expectations. In fact, we were amazed at how nice our next 2 hotels were after the Corinthia so they can definitely work to improve themselves."
Jan 2017,40,A good hotel to rest and be pampered,"The Hotel is very nice and the rooms arebeautiful, especcially the suite that we were provided once we complained about the noise due to works carried out next to our first room. The staff is very agreable and eager to please. The only bad point was the slowness in the restaurant when we ordered food from the menu and not from the buffet. But in the end the disshes were really worth the wait... The fish is generally really delicious and the breakfast is royal. We were on the overall quite happy with our stay."
Jan 2017,50,The best hotel in Lissabon!,It was a big pleasure to stay in Corinthia Hotel during our vacation in Lissabon.It was was on the best view from the room in my life and the best breakfest ever!the personal was very helpful ;)thank you very much for surprise cake to my birthsday))
Jan 2017,40,Always a Great experience,"Always is a pleasure to stay in this Hotel in Lisbon.Great rooms with amazing views, great service, great people, great food...are the reasons because all years back again.We'll back again soon. Sure!!!"
Jan 2017,40,Hotel is very nice but location is not the best,"Hotel is very nice and clean but, location is not the best. Staff is very helpful and accommodating. Room does not include breakfast but looking at the buffet offered we decided not to get the breakfast which is $20/person. We slept late and went across the street to a GREAT seafood restaurant just across the street: Sete Mares."
Jan 2017,50,Best in Lisbon,"Fantastic hotel with great staff. Extremely comfy bed and quiet room. Bathroom could do with a bit of updating such as a walk-in shower. Pool good, spa area better but charged €30 per hour, a little excessive, should be free for guests even for one hour."
Jan 2017,40,Christmas stay at Corinthia,"Luxurious hotel nearby the zoo in Lisbon. Very good breakfast buffet, beautiful, clean rooms, fully equiped. Friendly staff. Good service. Small but nice swimmingpool. Exclusive spa, to our taste too expensive."
Dec 2016,40,A pleasant experience staying in Lisbon,"A great experience while in Lisbon. parking facilities were great, amazing breakfast, high speed wireless. A good swimming pool. Great service and an enjoyable experience by the piano bar. Would highly recommend to anyone who want to enjoy high quality time"

Dec 2016,50,Excellent !,"I would highly recommend This hotel. Excellent breakfast, Nice rooms & friendly staff. Good spa & massage, location is situated next to metro. Great food. I would like to come againVery Nice atmosphere and staf is attent"
Dec 2016,50,Enjoyed our stay,"We were traveling with a bus tour and this was our designated hotel in Lisbon.  It wasn't in the downtown area, but a cab was very reasonable for the 4 of us to get there (6.45 Euro). The elevators were different and one of the staff members was there to help us get to our rooms upon arrival.  We had to swipe our room card and then press the floor number on the outside of the elevator.  We had to watch for which elevator was scheduled to stop at our floor.  Our room was very nice and we enjoyed the extra counter space in the bathroom and strong water pressure in the shower.  We found a nice variety of food for breakfast.  Our favorite was the omelet station.  Guest services at the hotel was very helpful with giving us suggestions for an evening trip downtown and suggestions for dinner."
Dec 2016,50,Visit i december weekend,"Excellent hotel, lounge is perfekt :-) food was incredible, personal was very kind  and helpful, we sleep very good in bed :-), we will  come back  very soon :-), we will recommended hotel to over friends :-)"

Dec 2016,30,Free transit hotel Eva Air,"Transit hotel.Rooms are clean but lack facilities.3 star NA standard.Breakfast provided is subpar for Asian standard, with not much to choose from except carbs.Local stuff,no protein like eggs etc.Sausages tastes ""plasticky"".No Tea but only coffee machine coffees of various kinds."
Dec 2016,50,Great experience,"We loved this hotel. It was a very pleasant experience. Will definitely recommend this hotel. I will also definitely choose this hotel when I come back to Lisbon. I travel a lot but this is one of the best experience, so far."
Dec 2016,40,"Outside city center, but next to metro/train station","Very comfortable room, quiet. Bed and linens were very comfortable.  Conference facilities also very nice. Indoor pool is beautiful and calm. Swimming caps are mandatory and may be purchased at spa.  Located on a block with several restaurants, ranging from bakery to seafood.  Helpful staff at Concierge.  We took the metro and train daily to various outings, very easy."
Dec 2016,40,Clean and wellkept hotel,"Stayed for three nights in october. The hotel is nice, clean and with nice staff all around.We had an executive room with access to executive lounge. Have to say though that the lounge is way better at the Corinthia in Budapest. The gym was under some sort of reconstruction and was moved to another very small area unfortunately. Tried the pool but was too cold to enjoy really.Breakfast was really good with all everything you could ask for.The hotel is in the business area of the town i.e. not very central. Walking to the citycenter is about 50 minutes but there are public transports close by. Overall, a good hotel and as expected given what you pay."
Dec 2016,50,Classy 5 star hotel,"This hotel exceeded our expectation. Very stylish and elegant hotel lobby, comfortable &  well decorated room, nice breakfast buffet, great indoor pool for kids & adults. Lastly, the staff are professional & helpful!5-10 mins taxi from the city center, marina and walking distance to the zoo which is convenient for family traveling with kids.I would like to thank the guest services and reservation agent for their thoughtful gestures on my birthday and assisting my husband to book last minute changes for my birthday family dinner celebration. We truly appreciated your help!The Spa was with great with very nice facilities. If I may just add an observation, it will be for the access to thermal facilities. Indeed its included if you have spa treatment but sadly payable for hotel guest. I think it's a bit pricy for an hour access esp for stay-in guest.  maybe consider waving it for long stay guest. (It is not a critic but just an observation)"
Dec 2016,50,Christmas in Lisbon,"It was a last minute decision to visit Lisbon for Christmas. Based on the reviews on Bookings.com and TripAdvisor we chose Corinthia. As soon as we entered the hotel we got our Christmas Gift, we were chosen Guest of the Day and given a free upgrade to Junior Suite. This really pepped up our trip. The staffs were so polite and pleasing. The suite was excellent. The executive lounge and the canapés were excellent. The choice of food for Breakfast was amazing. We got the hop on hop off sorted from the guest services without any hassle. The pick point was just 2 minutes walk from the rear of the lobby. Our only disappointment was that we couldn't enjoy the Spa because of short duration of our trip. We couldn't use our Spa Wowcher. We would definitely visit the property again or any other Corinthia."
Dec 2016,50,Comfortable stay,"Loved everything about the hotel, comfortable stay, stylish lobby. A minor thing - coffee in the morning - had to ""work"" for it, i.e. find someone to serve it as it's not available to serve yourself as was tea."
Dec 2016,30,"Nice staff, average food, location ok.","We'vee stayed for a weekend at Corinthia hotel. The location is ok, you can easily reach the city centre(15 minutes by car) the staff is very friendly and nice. The rooms are ok, they really need to clean or change that carpet that is smelly and dirty! The rooms have good size. We've stayed in a suite connected with a double room that allowed us to have a nice breakfast in the club room. There again, the staff couldn't be nicer! They do everything to you feel comfortable specially for the kids (we have 3!) . The diner at their restaurant has a good variety but I think they miss something there... it wasn't tasty. We just ate the first night there. Overall experience was good. Maybe will return because of the service and the attractive price. They have parking but charge you for that. No pool area."
Dec 2016,50,Great friendly hotel,"Really nice hotel, excellent service provided. Do not have anything negative to say. Breakfast could be a bit improved though. Room was a very good size, bathroom very nice as well. Very close to tube and train station, so very easy to get to, even at night time."
Dec 2016,40,Fantastic,"Great experience, real nice and calm Hotel in the centrum of Lisbon.Comfortable beds and nice decor.Sympathy of personnel and relax hotel.I have a Real a nice time,great quality/value hotel really recommend."
Dec 2016,50,"Perfect hotel for business, though far from city center","Convenient and easy accessible from the airport, but a little bit too far from the city center. Rooms are well equiped and quiet, conference facilities are great. Enjoyed a lot the breakfast - broad choice and even vegan food!"
Dec 2016,40,Friendly,"Nice hotel friendly staff, stayed here many times.    Some changes need in the design of the room for lady guest.   No mirror on the table/desk to enable drying of hair.   The hairdryer has coiled lead which is not long enough and you need to request extension lead.   Room service noticed a drop in the quality of the food.    Previously pizza have been good, these are now poor quality with the base not edible they appear to be bought in."
Dec 2016,50,Thank you,"Not any special comments, everything was great, thank you for keeping so good care of your customers. We all had a real great Lisbon visit :) Smiley, helpful people.Merry Christmas and happy New Year 2017"
Dec 2016,50,"Best Hotel that I've Stayed. (Last time I counted, I've been to 164 hotels after I turned 22)","This hotel really practices ""meeting customer's needs first""!I made a reservation for a single room but , oddly in the hotel's reaervation list, two rooms were booked. I couldn't make a cancellation of the extra room because of the hotel's policy of a month prior notice for rooms at a promotional price. As I was confident at the moment that it couldn't be my mistake, I blamed the fault on the hotel. At first, because there's very low or zero possibility of glitch in their reservation system, one of the representatives asserted that I'd probably made two reservations by accident. Since we couldn't settle our differences after 10 minnutes of long conversation, I was introduced to the hotel's duty manager, Diogo Pintos. That's when I felt that I was really being heard. Even though he was also leaning toward the possibility of my mistake because it was very unlikely to be any error in their booking system, he was very paitient and listen to our reasoning and our frustration for about an hour. Respecting my opinion and willingness to accomodate my family as much as possiblr so that we enjoy our stay throughout the entire trip, he waived the total charge even though the extra room couldn't be book out for other customers right away.Just like the Duty Manager, Diogo, hotel's staffs at the guest service desk were very welcoming and explained any question that I've inquired full detail, so I have sufficient information in taking tour around Lisbon area.I cannot also leave out the exceptional service by the servers in the hotel's diner. Never lost a smile, very warm and prompt.I've travelled more than 30 countries and stayed in numerous hotels but the service and accomodation of Corinthia Hotel in Lisbon is indeed the best!"
Dec 2016,50,Excellent price/quality ratio,"Easy to reach, quiet inside, excellent facilities, friendly&helpfull staff, extensive breakfast buffet..In fact I regretted that I could only stay in Lisbon for one night this time..:-(I definately recommend this hotel!"
Dec 2016,40,Good hotel not far from airport.,"I missed my connection flight and was put here by TAP. Nice hotel not far from the airport. Friendly staff, clean rooms and very nice buffet dinner. Not fully soundproof though, passing airplanes can be heard."
Dec 2016,50,Great hotel,"The hotel is well situated with a metro station just across the street.Very nice hotel with lovely and clean rooms.Superb staff, excellent breakfast, and amazing Spa!If we go back to Lisbon we will for sure stay again in This hotel."
Dec 2016,40,Good city hotel,"I regularly stay at the Corinthia as it's the best priced 5 star hotel in Lisbon. It is located just outside the city center which means that you need to have a car, grab a taxi or get the tube (which is 2 minutes walk way) to get to the center. On the other hand, if you like running like I do, you're right next to Monsanto which is great for a run. Just ask the doorman how to get there without getting lost on the way.The standard of service is good but doesn't go above and beyond what a 4 star hotel would give. The rooms are clean and well proportioned."
Dec 2016,40,Pleasant Stay,"I stayed in an executive suite, access to the executive lounge, which offers all the usual trimmings. The suite was large, clean, large size bathroom and extra washroom. Ample space to work, internet connection worked well. Breakfast was good. The service was efficient and friendly. I only spent one night, apparently an underground station is just a few meters away, the airport run took about 15 minutes. When in Lisbon I will certainly return."
Dec 2016,50,"Great Hotel, superb staff, Amazing stay!","Booked this as a pre-Christmas break, recommended hotel from a friend, certainly wasn't disappointed!Room was lovely, Spa as amazing.Staff were amazing and we got ""guest of the day"" and got an upgraded room 😊"
Dec 2016,50,very goed/fantastic,"very good hotel, clean, good breakfast, the bus and metro station nearest the hotel. Downtown is ten minutes by the metro. The zoo is ten minutes from the hotel. This hotel have many facilites and services are very good"
Dec 2016,40,Almost Excellent,"Glamour, Charme, Elegance! the hotel is so nice and cool that you would like to stay there longer. The rooms are fantastic, comfortable, crea and well equipped!Breakfast is one of the best ever eaten.I suggest this hotel. The only not excellent point refers to staff...somebody is not prepared, sometimes even not so polite."
Dec 2016,50,Excellent service and attention to detail,We stayed at the Corinthia during our DreamTrip to Portugal. The service is excellent. Everyone is ready and willing to serve and make your stay a memorable one. My son and I really enjoyed it. Obrigada!
Dec 2016,30,City Centre Hotel,Quite a nice restaurant with a well stocked buffet for evening meal.  Comfortable bed.  Small rooms.  TV channels the usual mix of foreign languages.  Fine for a short city centre stay or overnight airport stop.  Not a lot of character.
Dec 2016,50,Its very good and comfortable hotel. Good service and the breakfast is sublime.,The room are clean and location is good near airport and only 15 min from centre. Fitness is good size and new machines:-) Service and staff is very high quality. The area of pool is very good and clean.
Dec 2016,30,A nice hotel for business visits,"I was here for three nights for work. On the plus side the service was excellent.  I couldnt fault the staff. Very freindly, reactive, professional. The hotel itself has a nice ambience even if i personally object to Christmas music being blared into the lifts. My issues lie with the facilities which i feel let this hotel down. My bed was rather hard (appreciate thats a matter of taste) the plug next to my bed was broken so had to plug my phone into the one outside the bathroom which forced me to sit on the floor to respond to messages while it was charging. The shower was very inconsistent and would run luke warm for several minutes. I requested an iron (which was delivered) straight away, but which was damaged and didnt steam. Annoyingly as well all the spa facilities were closed during refurbishment. But i had to actuslly walk down to the Spa to ve told this rather than veing given that information at reception. Dur to the short duration of my stay (and i just couldnt be bothered to move rooms) i didnt bother reporting this to the desk and if i had im sure that they would have given me a better room. And i do think it was good value for money as the room was spacious. But Lisbon has a lot of nice hotels and they need to fix these issues to raise themselves above the crowd."
Dec 2016,50,Excellent,"Perfect time as usual, the service was very good and thank you for this nice time. If you have the opportunity stay in this hotel, i am sure you ll be more than satisfied. I ll recommand it strongly.."
Dec 2016,40,Great hotel ,"Stayed for work conference. Facilities and restaurants were fantastic. Bedroom was large and comfortable. Didn't checkout the pool/spa area. Only minor point, location was further away from the main city center than I'd have liked. But otherwise great hotel."
Dec 2016,40,Great hotel with an excellent SPA and Club lounge.,"The Corinthia Lisbon is a great hotel, but their SPA and Club lounge are excellent. Location is a bit out from the city center, but with metro nearby and rather cheap taxis right outside the hotel door, this is no big deal.The only downside to the room was the combined shower and bathtub."
Dec 2016,50,Wonderful team - made the trip,"People make a holiday. Your hotel can be the best but if the hotel team is not interested then the trip can be the worst. In this instance the Corinthia, Lisbon is a lovely hotel with an amazing team, Everyone makes you feel welcome, always with a friendly smile and time for a friendly chat. Brilliant team - thank you!"
Dec 2016,50,Short stay in Lisbon,"One of the Corinthia hotels we chose to stay based on our previous experience from Corinthia stays in Malta and Budapest, We were not disappointed. Excellent room with great views of Cristo Rei and Ponte 25 de Abril bridge. Wish we had a longer stay to explore historic Lisbon....The hotel was welcoming and pleasant - it is very close to Metro for easy access to all destinations"
Dec 2016,50,Superior hotel in Lisbon,Missed my connection so was stuck in Lisbon overnight.   Arrived at the Corinthia and was quickly checked in by a friendly and caring agent who could tell I was not in a good mood (due to the flight issues that day).  She was jovial and made me smile so I appreciated that.  Room was spacious and the bed very comfortable.  Excellent shower and room service was prompt and delicious.  Would stay there again.
Dec 2016,50,Excellent stay and hotel,"Enjoyed our stay and all the amenities. They have a wonderful spa, pool, and workout area. The staff were extremely friendly and the hotel breakfast was great!. The hotel room and bathroom were very accommodating and pleasant."
Dec 2016,50,Super!,"A very beautiful and fresh hotel, the rooms are very clean. Friendly staff, they help you with everything. The breakfast at sky lounge was very exclusive we really enjoyed it. I understand why it is a 5 star hotel. Totally worth the money!"
Dec 2016,40,Great hotel,"Great hotel, amazing food, and superb service. A little lacking in character for me, but it is only a personal preference of someone who usually chooses boutique hotels. Amazing location, walking distance from the metro, close to the Zoo, in the very heart of Lisbon. Great size rooms, very friendly and helpful staff, a true 5 star service."
Dec 2016,50,A short but excellent stay,"While we did not stay very long at your hotel, we were made to feel welcome by any one we came in contact with.  All staff was extremely friendly, outgoing and helpful with advice, directions and evening activities."
Dec 2016,50,hotel corinthia,"fabulous hotel, this was our third stay there - 5 star service and excellent staff.  We really liked the breakfast and the buffet dinner.   the hotel is situated very well for the metro, railway and even the Praca da Espanha bus station.   We look forward to returning there again."
Dec 2016,50,fantastic yet again,second time at this fantastic hotel on a city break and just as good staff very frendly and helpful we booked executive again personal check in and access to sky lounge and rooms with superb viewshotelis located a few kilometers from main area but not an issue metro staion over the road cost just over a euro for any 1 trip or 6 euros for 24hrs metro bus and trams the beds in this hotel are so comfortable breakfaast very good would highly recomend just got there as they were putting up christmas decorations so beautifull and professional done
Dec 2016,40,Good business hotel,"Spent a couple of nights in this hotel earlier this week and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. There was a slight mishap at check in when my club access hadn't been recorded but it was quickly rectified. The room was quite small and a little bit dated but it was very comfortable, the toiletries were good quality and the wifi connection was quick. The breakfast in the hotel was excellent with lots of choice, an omelette station and even a leg of iberico ham. The executive club on the 24th floor is a nice place to relax in the evening, with complementary wine, beer, soft drinks and snacks until 10pm. This is a good business hotel. The size makes it slightly impersonal and if I was on holiday, I'd probably choose something slightly more boutique but I'll definitely stay here again when travelling for work."
Dec 2016,50,Such a amazing hotel and staff!,"I like to thank first of all to reception staff Rita,Joanna,and hotel GM who really helped my stay more pleasant,they offered me top floor as requested and also extend my checkout time without any charge which is amazing and i visited other countries in corinthia and they are also good like this one,overall hotel is so good as location and transport link all are so close from hotel,i really recommend this hotel as overall service from entry till checkout all the staff are so friendly and helpful."
Dec 2016,50,Fabulous Hotel,Returned from a fabulous stay at this hotel that certainly offered a 5 Star service. The staff were very welcoming and accommodating from start to finish. Really cannot fault our stay here at all. The executive lounge is a great touch & would certain encourage a return visit to this chain of hotels. Staff were exceptional &  a real credit to the Corinthia in Lisbon.
Nov 2016,50,Everyone and Everything Exceeded Expectations,"From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with friendly smiles and greetings. Check in was quick, and soon we were in our room on the 22nd floor. The view of Lisboa was breathtaking and whether Day or night, I had the drapes drawn to take it all in. Loved the bathtub, where soaking and unwinding after long days of touring was welcomed. The shower head pressure was strong which we loved! There was music in the wash rooms which could be made silent if desired. Ample closet space and shelves/drawers for clothing. A massage recliner. The Executive Lounge... wow, we had breakfast daily. Teas, Portuguese coffee, Pastries, Fresh Fruit, Toast, Continental Buffet Breakfast... the list goes on! Thank you to the wonderful staff."
Nov 2016,20,Not a 5 star hotel,"My husband and I recently spent a weekend at the Corinthia Lisboa. It was our first trip as newly weds and so we splurged for a 5 star hotel. We were able to check in early after a very long redeye flight, but we were put in a room riget next to maintenence so it was very loud and hard to sleep. We decided to just go enjoy our first day and go to bed early to make up for the lack of sleep. The first night our room was incredibly hot, but we were very jetlagged and assumed we had misused the heat.The second night we made a point to turn on the air conditioning on high to make sure we were cool enough. We both woke up to the ACT spitting hot air. We couldn't get it cooler, so we just opened the windows. But the traffic was very loud and made it hard to sleep. The next morning on our way out we spoke to the front desk about the issue and were assured they would send maintenence up to fix it. We returned that night to a room with no AC that was still very hot. We called the front desk and they promised to send maintenence right up. 30 minutes later still no maintenence so we called the desk again. This time we were told all the heat was on a main system and there was nothing that could be done. We asked to speak to a manager who had us moved to a new room. The second room was an upgrade to a suite and was much nicer,  but it was a smoking room so we switched again to another suite. We were much happier until we once again woke in thr middle of the night sweating even though the AC was on full blast. The next morning on our way out we asked to speak with a manager. He was very apologetic and embarrassed. We said we understood the heating system issue, however we had paid a 5 star price for this hotel room and needed to be able to sleep so we atleast needed a fan. He said he would take care of it. We returned late that night ( it was our final night in Lisbon so we went out for a nice dinner.) We have a nice note and a bottle of wine on our room...but no fan and still no working AC. By this time we were exhausted from 3 sleepless nights and just wanted to get home so we didn't call to complain again since obviously nothing was being done. This hotel has a great location across from the metro and is very clean and the staff is friendly, but it is absolutely not a 5 star hotel. If you stay here you will pay 5 star prices and it will not be worth it!Save your money and stay at a lesser quality hotel closer to the city center. Not worth it!!"
Nov 2016,40,very good,"Very Good except the room temperature was hard to adjust.  I felt  the temperature was too warm inside the room and it seemed no way to cool it off thru the adjustment.  Meanwhile, the cigarette smoke smell was very obvious in the hallway and elevator waiting area."
Nov 2016,50,Relaxed and comfortable stay,"Modern, relatively new hotel. Well maintened. I had space  and comfortable room at 18th floor with lively city view; large bathroom with basically all you need for a perfect stay. comfortable bed and sofa, mini bar, relatively expensive."
Nov 2016,50,Very Comfortable,"Stayed here for work and it was great other than not always sufficiently hot water for a bath.  The bed was comfortable and the breakfasts were amazing.  Great location for the metro which is cheap and easy to navigate, we never waited more than 6 minutes for a train. Think if I was to come again for a holiday, I might choose somewhere less anodyne, more Portuguese..."
Nov 2016,50,Gerry,We had a very good stay and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. It was very simple and cost effective to simply take a short taxi ride into the city centre. The staff were knowledgeable about where to go depending upon what it was that we wanted to do.
Nov 2016,50,Best,Very nice Hotel in a very strategic location. Very kind Personell excellent service.Room was very clean and we hand an excellent view from the 16th floor.Nice SPA pool and gym even if we didn't use them we went to see them and they were beautiful.
Nov 2016,50,super,excellent services by very good instructed people. the room was very clean and luxury. wewill never forget the super good breakfast. Even the fitness room and the pool were very good. the restaurant quality was average;
Nov 2016,50,GOOD,"Very nice hotel, in a good place.Near the metro SETE RIOS o JARDIN ZOOLGICO to arrival in tehe centre of city.The staff are excelent.The executive level is perfect n the floor 24.Complimentary Wi-Fi throughout the hotel."
Nov 2016,50,Very Good Hotel,"Great hotel and staff! Location is steps from the Metro station and very convenient to go anywhere in Portugal. Staff is A+ for  tours, taxis not too expensive, and food, drinks are superb. Indoor pool, big and beautiful with all the spa treatments to go with. Fantastic view comfy bed. We will certainly return!   Loved Our Stay!!!"
Nov 2016,50,Business in Lisbon,"Hotel accommodation, facilities and staff combine to deliver the perfect location for any business activities in Lisbon downtown.  Access to the Discovery lounge is an added bonus of executive level accommodation, as it is an ideal location to meet business associates outside of the office."
Nov 2016,50,Great Hotel ,"Beautiful luxury hotel located on on heart of lisborn, Big lobby and very comfortable bed in the rooms, the staff are really professional to deal with customers we enjoyed the hotel view and facilities and the delicious breakfast in the morning, I would obviously recommend thos hotel to all everyone looking for relaxing and spend beautiful vacation in lisbon...Special Thanks for Ms Rita she is very helpful lady and providing excellent services in such  professionalism way..Regards.."
Nov 2016,50,great hotel and wonderful staff,Lovely hotel and excellent stay in the Executive floor. Room large and comfortable with all amenities. Guillermo and Monika were wonderful to talk to and helped us in planning our days in Lisbon. Staff best assest of the hotel
Nov 2016,50,Great Hotel and great service,The hotel is great although location is not amazing and you will need a taxi or a hire car to get to the town centre. It is worth to upgrade to a junior suite as the views we had were amazing and the upgrade is not that much more.Breakfast in the main restaurant offers a larger selection than in the executive lounge but the choices are pretty good.Staff are very friendly and really helpful. Nothing seemed to be a problem for anyone.Parking is a little expensive when you hire a car but other than that it is great and we would recommend a stay here if you don't mind taking a taxi to town.
Nov 2016,40,Large Hotel outside of the main tourist areas,This is a large hotel situated outside the main tourist areas of Lisbon but convenient for the airport. Unfortunately it is beneath the flight path and noise was a problem for us. Hotel is often used by tour groups. Good buffet breakfast and buffet dinner quite good. Rooms are of a good size and beds comfortable. There is a metro stop within a few minutes walk of the hotel as is a stop for the on/off bus. Tickets can be obtained from the hotel.
Nov 2016,50,another excellent stay,Extremely good value.  5-stars for Lisbon for sure.  Pay the little extra for a king room or a junior suite - well worth the small price.  Easy access to the airport and business centers.  Nothing to really complain about.
Nov 2016,40,Very good suitable for business conferences,"I had a chance to visit Corinthia hotel and review the meeting rooms. I find hotel Corinthia an ideal place for a high-level business meeting.  It has its own conference spaces, many meeting rooms and capacity to accommodate many participants."
Nov 2016,50,"A+ for hotel, B- for location!","Great hotel, everything inside out was excellent. No complaints really, except the room was a bit on the smaller side. Parking is 18 euros a night, so I recommend parking on the street where weekends are free and weekdays free after 7pm until 9am. Hotel was definitely a 5 star property but location was about a 8-10 minute drive from downtown where all the restaurants and shopping are. About a 8 euro cab ride away from the action."
Nov 2016,50,Fabulous place to stay,"Arrived to a very warm welcome staff in reception are extremely good at there job.we were lucky to get upgraded and had an amazing view of the city.also access to executive lounge on top floor is a great bonus.Lisbon city has a lot to see and  do and the corninthia hotel is the right place to stay, *****"
Nov 2016,50,great Location and lovely hotel,"Just got back from a 3 night stay. we had access to the sky lounge which was well worth the extra the 3 staff that looked after us all deserve a commendation as nothing was to much trouble, Monica, Daniel  and Guilherne ( william). Breakfast was excellent and the views amazing from the lounge. Room was very clean and bed very comfortable. Very easy to get around Lisbon on the Metro. The daily 24 hour ticket was 6 euros which allowed unlimited travel on the Metro Buses and Trams, we went to Cascais up the coast and the fare was 4 euros return, nice place to visist"
Nov 2016,50,Great place to stay,"This hotel is comfortable, the staff is courteous and the food is great.  The tapas in the bar are wonderful.  They are perfect for a couple - one bite for each.  The location is very good also.  Our room was very clean and the bed was comfortable."
Nov 2016,50,meeting/leisure,Excellent hotel and amenitiesLovely poolGreat food and meeting spacesClose to Metro and yellow bus toursClose to airport with easy accessQuiet and comfortable roomI would return and recommend it to all.
Nov 2016,40,Very comfortable - good breakfast.,Stayed here for 2 nights whilst on a business trip.Very comfortable room and bed. Breakfast excellent. Recommend the fish restaurant directly opposite.Impressed with the lifts which only operate with a room card swipe.
Nov 2016,40,excellent hotel with problems of booking/check in,"we booked a siute.Plus:excellent executive lounge with good variety of beverages and food throughout the whole day, very nice staff people in the lounge. hotel close to metro.Minus:long queue for check in and not sufficient people at reception resulted in 10 min waiting time. Althoug booked more than 5 month in advance, our request for a remote and quiet suite in the highest posdible floor was not taken into account, we got a suite on 22nd floor where the service area with elevator noise was directly behind our beds, i.e most probably the noisiest site. luggage was delivered to the wrong room and we had to wait a long period of time until we received it."
Nov 2016,50,Birthday treat ,"I booked a room some months ago in preparation for my wife's birthday, when we got to the hotel they very kindly upgraded us to a junior suite.Check in was highly professional which included a smile from the lovely Rita, chocolate and a 1:1 demo of the lift - lovely.The room was amazing, comfortable furniture and bed. The breakfast was plentiful with a wide selection of hot and cold foods and coffee on tap 😀It is very easy to get around Lisbon from here with the metro a 5 minute walk.Couldn't fault the service received and highly recommend this touch of luxury!"
Nov 2016,40,A nice executive hotel that is reasonably close to everything,"Nice stay in a typical 4 star hotel. Decent location and comfortable rooms.Breakfast was a bit pricey at 20 euros each but was good quality, although I found Portugal to be above average quality generally wherever we ate.10 minutes from airport and across the road from the nearest Metro.Happily stay there again"
Nov 2016,40,"Good location, friendly  staff, Piano in the bar in the evenings- relaxing stay.","Sumptous breakfast, friendly service, excellent  knowledgeable conceirge  staff. Good healthy food served in  amicable sorroundings.Tea lounge had egg tarts- very fresh and inviting.Wish you all luck- keep it up till my next trip."
Nov 2016,50,Stunning Hotel,Excellent hotel and very professional staff. The trip was business so didn't eat in the evening but the breakfast was second to none. The rooms were to a very high standard with extremely comfortable beds.
Nov 2016,40,good value,"For food allergy sufferers there are plenty of options at breakfast,  but eat out in the evening.  As a gluten intolerant person I felt I was playing roulette at dinner.  However, there are plenty of good restaurants in the vicinity.  Dairy and Egg containing meals were clearly labelled,  Hotel facilities good, excellent sound proofing and generally good value facilities.  Near end of metro line from airport (and zoo metro stop)."
Nov 2016,30,Just looks pretty,"The hotel is beautiful but...that's just about it. To make a long story short, the front desk was relatively nice with the exception of two people. Two of the outlets didn't work in the room which were key outlets in convenient locations. The right sink in the room was leaking when you turned the water on. I called and asked them to send someone anytime after 11am since we would be gone during that time. I don't know if they sent someone because it was still leaking when we came back. The hairdryer sounded like a chainsaw. The worst though was the AC situation. It got so hot and stuffy in that room so we turned on the AC the first night. Nothing. So we called downstairs. They said it was something with the computer and that they'd send a technician upstairs. We said okay. They did so and it worked. Fine. The next night, we woke up in the middle of the night sweating again. Called downstairs, same story. The third night, before the night even started, we called down and told them this has been happening and to change the computers now. They said okay. Then my dad went downstairs to make sure it was done. They said it was. 12:30am hits and we are all sweating yet again. Called down, same story. This was supposed to be a nice vacation for us but I can't say we got one decent night of sleep."
Nov 2016,30,Nothing extraordinary,"Stayed here with my pregnant wife to visit Lisbon and have some quality resting time in the hotel. Highlights were the pool and a comfy bed, the least to expect from 5* hotel. Check in and out was slow and I missed the smiles from the personnel. Gym was being refurbished and poorly equipped, bubble bath is part of spa and therefore not accessible for non spa guests. Website should have mentioned this."
Nov 2016,50,Excellent,"Wonderful hotel in very convenient part of Lisbon   Pilote staff, amazing breakfast every morning. Included fresh and delicious pastries, cheeses and meats. Highly unique and efficient elevator system was also very interesting."
Nov 2016,40,Great hotel in beautiful Lisbon,"Excellent conference hotel, well located with easy access to beautiful Lisbon by cheap taxis. After little trouble at checkin to get the proper room great stay, excellent breakfast and good conference facilities."
Nov 2016,50,Definitely 5-Star Hotel,We were very impressed with not only with the hotel but the staff were all friendly and helpful. The hotel is very close to the Metro so it was easy to get around. We upgraded to the Executive Sky Club which was worth every bit. We would like to give a special thank you to Daniel and the rest of the staff at Sky Lounge.
Nov 2016,50,beautiful hotel,"Very convenient location, clean, modern, breakfast is very good. My friend an dI were really enjoying staying in the hotel. The only problem was hairdryer was not working, and took long time for them to check the problem and brought a new one to us."
Nov 2016,40,Will recommend this hotel,Very nice hotel executive club and friendly guest servicesSurrounded with one of the best good restaurant in Lisbon called AmbassadorAlso courte the Ingles one of the best malls and also hotel has very convenient location close to the transportation of all kind and Zoo
Nov 2016,50,Lovely Lisbon Hotel,"Beautiful hotel with excellent service, friendly team members and great food. I came for a large conference with many people staying there and they treated me like a star. I found the room to be very comfortable, the amenities excellent, and well-suited for business travel. The only thing I would change would be to have the hot tub included in the stay with the pool, since you had to pay extra to use the hot tub. The pool itself was beautiful though, and indoors. I loved this hotel."
Nov 2016,50,Luxury stay,Great facilities for business or family break. Friendly & helpful hotel staff Good choice in cuisine & dining Generous room size with quality furnishings . Very clean & well maintained. Would definitely return for a short break with family.
Nov 2016,50,Smiles,"My stay was due to a medical meeting in the hotel. With hundreds of people there, what impressed me more was the fact that everybody was gentle, calm and smiling. Everybody of the hotel staff had his/her own function so you could rely on prompt answers to your big or small problems.Rooms were cleaned in an ""invisible"" way but very effectively. The sleeping quality was very good.The hotel is near the airport for easy transfers. If you are there for tourism this could cause some problems but there is a metro station at a walking distance. I would absolutely suggest this hotel and come back in the future."
Nov 2016,30,"Fancy, but too many frustrations","The marble floors, the doorman in a top hat, the large and friendly staff, and the table of elegant snacks in the lobby make one think ""Oh, this will be great!""Then one registers; it was probably the slowest ever. Clearly they need a new computer system. One gets to the room, and finds that there are TWO unused electrical outlets, under a door in the top of the desk. That's all.It's bedtime, and one learns that the AC is underpowered, and the cover on the bed is a duvet that would keep one warm in Helsinki. The mattress was good, as was the noise control (as long as one keeps the window closed--the hotel is beneath a busy flight path to the airport. Plane-spotters should be happy).The bathroom is fine, though the tub is so high and deep that it can be tricky to get in and out. The wi-fi works well. The breakfast offerings are excellent, but it can be hard to get a cup of coffee on a busy morning (they have servers running around to pour it into small cups from small pots--why not just leave the pot on the table?)The most frustrating part of my stay was having the AC quit overnight; I would go to sleep in a comfortable room, and awaken in the wee hours with the temperature 24C or higher and hot air blowing on me (even though the thermostat was set to 5-10C!). They ""fixed"" this a few times until I complained to the manager, and was given another room.The location is okay; the Zoo is less than a 10 minute walk away, and there is a Metro station that goes ""downtown"" about a 5 minute walk from the front door. The hotel is in a web of highways, though, and going almost anywhere else involves a taxi or Uber."
Nov 2016,40,Amazing experience!,"Stayed for 2 nights as a coule, accompanied by my elderly mum.  Natacha at reception when we checked in was a true professional.  She was efficient, polite and showed empathy towards my mum which was over and above her call fo duty.  Thank you.Also, housekeeping were efficient and professional to adjust the room to my mums needs (mattress change, chair in shower).  Thank you.Accommodation was awesome took out breaths away, views were amazing.Car valet service is a must as we had no worries about parking and every time we stepped out the car was waiting for us.  Totally worth the daily rate for parking.Restaurant lacks a-la carte vegetarian options - the hotel needs to work on that.Thank you Corinthia, we will be returning."
Nov 2016,50,enjoyed our stay,"Attended for a conference. Excellent amenities, great location. Metro was very convenient. Gym area was very nice. Meals were excellent and the service was very good. Concierge staff was very helpful."
Nov 2016,50,CTOS,"International conference, met some wonderful people/ colleagues. Educational/ sponsors were amazing , we were looked after very well. Gala dinner held at Kais , absolutely amazing. Went to the beer museum , traditional Portuguese food, fabulous place."
Nov 2016,50,***** worth it,"Excellent hotel, worth its *****. Friendly staff, eager to make your stay as Nice as possible. Clean rooms, bathroom with a bath. Excellent breakfast and deining faciliteren. Metro nearby, in 10 minutes you can be in the city center (1 line)."
Nov 2016,50,Good location,Great location from which to walk around the central part of Lisbon. Not noisy at all.Comfortable beds and room a good size. Lovely pool and bar area. Gym and sauna are small but no time to use it anyway. Not far from the Sky Bar which was fun for cocktails
Nov 2016,50,The best stay for long,Good quality and great service for the money Food and rooms services fantastic. Cleanness super Easy access to transport and near to restaurants outside hotel. Thanks for great stay! See you another time!
Nov 2016,50,First class modern hotel,We thoroughly enjoyed our four night stay in a junior suite. It was stylish and comfortable.  The staff were polite and helpful and I was delighted to find a bottle of bubbly and a chocolate cake in my room on my birthday.   It is very convenient for the metro and if you dont want to eat in the hotel has one of Lisbon's best fish restaurants nearby.
Nov 2016,40,Tony  10th November 2016,"Everything about this hotel was great except breakfast, more thought and a better quality hot selection would have been better, though I would stay again.Location and distance from the centre was a little far, but no fault of the hotel. The Metro was handy and a local bus guide would have helped but I did not think to ask."
Nov 2016,50,Outstanding hotel,"Premises, people and food excellent. A must in Lisbon. Either for business or leisure is a really convenient hotel. Good transport close to the hotel. Full equipped in terms of spa, pool, gym and restaurants"
Nov 2016,40,"Our stay was relaxing, this was partly due to the help of the hotel staff. Our room was nice.","Our stay was relaxing, this was partly due to the help of the hotel staff. Our room was nice.Breakfast was very good. The metro near the hotel is perfect. When we are going back to Lisbon we are going again to this hotel."
Nov 2016,50,True Masterpiece with Seven star Customer care.,"Corinthia Hotel Lisbon , situated in heart of Lisbon ...Am bit speechless and really can't gather words  regards  thoughts ,memories and experience of my stay with  Hotel Corinthia .Decor very modern n stylish front desk very efficient smiling and always helpful , actually the hospitality starts from moment you step down your car welcomed by gentleman's with hat . We stayed in executive suite room and room was perfect spacious looking the beautiful Lisbon city .The executive sky Lounge is all together different platform of customer care with utmost personal touch n care taken of whatever expressed .I would just not forget to mention about Mr Daniel who works at the Sky lounge His greeting good morning to good evening is the same with same smile and energy difficult to make out when his day begins and day ends.Aparts all staff is really very very good smiling and helpful , Housekeeping is itself taking away few stars out of Seven stars I have rated  hats off to them.I can go on and on writing about Corinthia Me my wife and son we all loved this place and sure to stay with you next time when in Lisbon.Worth recommending for me it's not a Five star But a Seven star with its upscale customer care."
Nov 2016,50,Our home from home,"Every year i attend the music festival NOS alive , for the last 4 years we have stayed at the  Corinthia , i cannot recommend it enough . The staff are friendly , professional and efficient , the rooms look and feel luxurious which is a huge bonus coming from a festival site !. The outdoor bar area is the perfect spot to  pass away the afternoon with a refreshing cocktail and the spa is my favourite part of the day !! . I look forward to staying there again this year"
Nov 2016,50,"Great hotel, great location","A friend and I stayed here for 3 nights. It was very clean and they actually change the sheets daily. The staff were nice and spoke a lot of languages. It's removed enough from the city noise but a 10-15 minutes cab ride gets you to a few places, from where you can start enjoying the city. There is cab stand and a bus stop right outside the hotel."
Nov 2016,50,ARISTON,Staff w/happy faces and willing to help. The bed was perfect. Restaurant food very tasty + reasonable prices. Breakfast had everything. Metro next to the hotel.For sure I would stay there again and highly recomment for Lisbon.
Nov 2016,40,Great hotel,"I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights for a business event. Very nice hotel with attentive staff. Rooms as to be expected, very clean and no surrounding noise. Close to the airport and on the other hand also close to the city center. Taxi needed however."
Nov 2016,40,No bad!! ,Very nice hotel for doing business  with a lot of meeting room very elegance and large.. Nice spa for relaxing if you can.. Nice work out room if you can do it.. Need to take taxi for visiting center but also you can walk.. Price is acceptable for many reason.. Room are comfortable and clean.. Service very good.. Breakfast can be better.. At the end good rating from my side.
Nov 2016,50,Corinthia Hotel Lisbon,"Excellent hotel, a bit removed from the Old Town but cabs are plentiful. Really worth upgrading to access the Executive Lounge where the staff, particularly Daniel and Monica are most helpful and professional."
Nov 2016,40,Up to expectations,"We stayed four nights in November. The staff were all efficient, attentive and cheerful. Everything was well organised. The décor and furnishings in the room were up  to expectation. The swimming pool was pleasant and the gym useful, the bar was attractive but perhaps lacked a buzz. Breakfast in the mornings was excellent. We did not use the restaurants. I was surprised at the mix of clientele. I had expected this to be purely a business hotel but I would guess that whilst we were there more than half the guests were couples or families. All in all we were very pleased with our stay."
Nov 2016,50,"Excellent breakfast, good location","We enjoyed our stay in the hotel. The breakfast was excellent, five star quality. Good location near a metro station, easy access to the city center. The room was nice but not spacious. Lobby classy and elegant but room maybe needs better care to small details."
Nov 2016,50,High class,We were in Lisbon for a conference then stayed on for vacation after.  A lovely setting and very high class.  The lobby is beautiful with desserts offered in the afternoon.  The rooms are very modern although not overly large.  The staff are so polite and helpful. Not located close to the downtown or the conference center - but not a problem as the cabs are quite reasonable and readily available.
Nov 2016,50,Top Notch,Our group stayed her for 5 nights.  All of the amenities in the hotel were excellent.  The gym was being renovated so I didn't see the typical arrangement.  Temp was pretty limited in machines and space.  Included breakfast was excellent and service was excellent even on the 2 days when they were at capacity.  Location within a couple of blocks from the subway was convenient   In hotel restaurant and nearby restaurants were very good when we needed quick meals.  Room was spacious and comfortable.
Nov 2016,50,Great hotel,"Definitely recommend this hotel, ticks all the boxes and also has a great location near to train/metro and the zoo and just far enough from the main touristy areas. Also the Executive suite is well worth the additional expense."
Nov 2016,40,Great Hotel,"really good hotel with great service and all small details you'll expect from a 4 star hotel. The room was big, well appointed and clean. Room service is pretty good and not so expensive. As there are not so many restaurants in the area (mostly meat only restaurants) we have also tried the hotel's restaurant ( buffet)...great service but the food was disappointing. We got there after nine so there was not a lot of choice and it felt a bit like it was closing time. The hotel is close to a subway station, street parking is easy. Lisbon is a small city so you're never far from anything."
Oct 2016,30,Excellent staff and service,"The ser Service is very good and the staff are very polite and professional. They tried their best to resolve your problems. Anything that we had problems with their resolve it there and then. If you go to the set up you must try the spa treatments as they are very very good, it's worth every penny!  The staff are brilliant at the spa and the treatments are amazing."
Oct 2016,40,Great hotel located in a great place,We came here for couple of days. The hotel is very close to the zoo. The staff are very nice and helpful. Rooms are big and clear. Don't forget to ask for coupons for the main attractions in the city. Highly recommended.
Oct 2016,50,Giulio,"Unfortunately my stay in the hotel was very short therefore the evaluation is based on the bref observation. Definitely would recommend this hotel and will return in the first opportunity. The location of the hotel is good for business traveler not far from the airport and enough far from the center, which could be reach by nearby underground. For the traveler seeking to experienced local cousin there is varriors restaurant around the hotel."
Oct 2016,50,"Fabulous hotel, good location","We stayed in April 2015, so this review is a little late. The hotel was beautiful. We had two connecting rooms which were well-appointed. My son's birthday occured while we were here and they brought him up a cake, which was very kind.  The breakfast spread, which was included with our room, was good. There were plenty of options and all members of our family were happy. Other reviews had recommended taking the bus from the airport to the hotel, which we did upon arrival but found crowded and difficult to know how to get to the hotle from the stop.  However, we soon realized there is a metro stop half a block down across the street from the hotel.  This made it convenient to get everywhere in the city. It also made it easy to return to the airport. I wish we had known that upon arrival, as the metro is right outside the airport as well."
Oct 2016,50,Excellence,"A wonderful hotel, very high standards of service, nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The food was excellent and plentiful. We would be happy to stay there again. Whilst the hotel isn't really near the centre you can travel by underground which is less than 100 metres away."
Oct 2016,50,LISBON VISIT,Hotel and all staff were wonderful.  Breakfast was excellent.   Hotel location near the metro and the zoo was great.  I look forward to my next business meeting at Lisbon to stay at the Corinthia.  Best hotel in the area.
Oct 2016,50,First time in Lisbon...,First impressions are lasting ones.  We will never forget the wonderful Corinthia hotel and its staff.  The Concierge helped us with tours.  We stayed for four nights and went on 4 tours...all very informative.  The hotel managers were very helpful.
Oct 2016,40,"Real 5-star service, for a good price but in a business area","Hotel offers real 5-star service. Accommodations are large and comfortable, but overall are a bit outdated. Carpets and sofas on the breakfast area have lots of stains. The hotel is in a business area but we were driving so it was not an issue at all to visit Lisboa. However, you don't feel too much of the Lisbon atmosphere, etc. Parking is available at the hotel, but it's expensive. We were able to park in the surrounding area overnight for free every night. Area seems to be safe. Overall, a great experience for the price. Would definitely stay again."
Oct 2016,30,Pleasant Hotel not far from the center,"Good hotel, elegant, a little crowed at breakfast. Rooms nice, not exceptional (sockets, facilities, etc). We were three in a double room, with addictional single bed. Space scarcely enough. Anyhow not noisy, comfortable bed, big beatiful bathroom."
Oct 2016,40,Corinthia hotel Lisbon,"We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is nice, and even though is not located in Lisbon center, near by there is a stop of the blue line Yellow bus that takes you to a tour through the main sites of  Lisbon. Rooms are very comfortable and very clean, service was very good. Nevertheless we experienced two problems: 1. Although we booked two rooms via the Discovery Club that the hotel belongs to, they reserved only one room and we had to wait some time until they found another room (same quality). 2. We had 3 times dinner buffet in the hotel restaurant. The first two were excellent with large variety of different food but the third (same price) was removed to another restaurant in the hotel and was relatively poor. In spite of these two problems we certainly recommend this hotel."
Oct 2016,40,Very Nice Hotel,"All staff were very helpful; nothing was too much trouble.  Easy check in.  Concierge very helpful with maps, recommendations, etc.  Rooms very clean and well equipped.  Comfortable beds.  Bathroom very nice - large, fluffy towels.  Toiletries all included.  Hairdryer in room.  Very convenient location for the underground station which was about five minutes walk away.  Very nice breakfast.  Only complaint was the time it took to get a fried egg - all freshly fried, but always a long queue."
Oct 2016,30,Expected more...,"We chose this for a 5 night stay based on an incredible experience at Corinthia London.  There's no comparison but that's our fault for setting those expectations, not theirs... So, we booked a family room which comprises 2 interconnecting rooms. One of the 2 rooms wasn't ready when we arrived late afternoon.  No hint of an apology and when I asked when it would be ready,  I was told collect them on your way up when you return from going out - strange given that we hadn't planned to go out.. we all wanted to nap after 9 hours door-door travel but we couldn't as three adults and 2 kids couldn't nap in one twin room!! The hotel is a €12 taxi ride to the city centre so that needs to be factored in as there are no restaurants in the area (more accurately,  there are 2 with v mediocre reviews).  We therefore had to get taxis in the day for sightseeing and again in the eve for supper.  The pool area is ok but the hotel charge hotel guests  €30 to use the sauna....The rooms are clean but tired. Breakfast is ok but only basic filter coffee offered and missing things like birchers, museli, porridge, pancakes so relatively limited selection. Products in bathrooms are ok but not the nicer Espa range they have by the pool. Would poss recommend if they charged 4star prices as doesn't hit the mark for a 5 star."
Oct 2016,30,Disappointing,The gym was in the middle of a refurb - which was not advised before booking - and the temporary gym was inadequate in both facilities and environment ( tiny room with no air-con ). This was reported to the front desk who were very apathetic about it.
Oct 2016,40,Birthday surprise.,"My wife booked a four night break for me and my family. We had an executive lounge giving us access to the executive club lounge. The staff are amongst some of the most attentive that we have come across, nothing was too much trouble. The room was very nice, a huge double bed in the main bedroom with a separate room off it leading to the lounge, this was where my sons bed was put....still with plenty of room. The use of the executive club lounge was especially welcome with complimentary nibbles, soup, cheeses, cakes and more, together with soft and alcoholic drinks. The breakfasts were plentiful with a wide variety of food available from bacon, beans, sausage...the usual English concoction, but also plenty of other foods from cheeses, sardines, omelettes, salmon and more. The location of the hotel is not central but with the metro literally a 2 minute walk away, access throughout Lisbon is not a problem and a great way to explore the city.The only negative thing I would say is that the swimming pool area is not befitting with a 5 start hotel. The use of the Acqua area, which contains a sauna, steam room, various showers, whirlpool and pools with differing applications should also be included within the cost of the hotel, maybe on the same basis as the executive club lounge. When paying 'x' amount for a certain kind of room I would expect activities mentioned above to be included. Overall, a very pleasant stay and a hotel that we will definitely be returning to."
Oct 2016,50,Amazing Staff & Hotel,"This hotel is excellent. The staff cannot do enough for you, Diago the Duty Manager was extremely helpful and courtes and the staff member Daniel in the executive lounge was brilliant. From start to finish the whole experience was most enjoyable."
Oct 2016,50,Great hotel,"Good location, very close to the subway,secure hotel  comfortable room,   easy check in and out,  staff very helpful and friendly, would definitely stay again.The only downside was the lack of English speaking channels on the TV."
Oct 2016,30,Disappointing,"The standard of cleanliness in the bedroom and bathroom on arrival fell short of what one might expect of a hotel of this quality. Although remedied promptly, one should not expect to have to call housekeeping, on arrival, to hoover the carpet and again, when wanting to use the bath, because it had not been cleaned after the previous guests"
Oct 2016,50,Exceptionally good hotel,"Wonderful three days stay at this lovely hotel. Staff are some of the very best I have found anywhere in the world.  Nothing is too much trouble. Comfortable bed with lovely soft pillows. One small gripe, they have a strange electrical power supply in the bedrooms.  It took us ages to find a power supply for a laptop and then it only worked when a particular switch was on.Breakfasts were superb with a very large selection."
Oct 2016,50,By Paddy 20/10/2016,"We very much enjoyed our stay, the staff were attentive and helpful, the facilities good and the breakfast excellent. The room was quiet .... carpets help in this! Excellent bathroom, and we enjoyed the pool."
Oct 2016,50,5 stars means 5 satars,"Although the location was not the best (but you were only 5 minutes to the nearest metro station, 10 mins to the nearest tour bus stop and 15 mins to the nearest mall, walking) The walls of the rooms were also a little thin and the radio/tv channels were limited. You did get your complementary tea/coffee and bath products (the tea/coffee/milk was refilled daily). The service was excellent, rooms clean and comfortable and the breakfast superb. So if you want to splash out for a better hotel, this one is worth it. (bio-shock fans will love the lifts)"
Oct 2016,40,Comfortable hotel with good connections to both airport and downtown ,5* hotel within walking distance of the Sete Rios train station and the Jardim Zoological Metro station as well 10 minutes by taxi/Uber from the airport. We had a pleasant stay here from which we explored the city. The rooms are not very large but clean and comfortable. Breakfast is expansive and staff is most friendly and helpful.
Oct 2016,40,Good hotel for conference,"Hotel has a good location near a metro station. It has good facilities for a conference .The service is prompt and food served is good. The breakfast platter was good. The check in /check out was comfortable. The AC controls were not so good. The mattress I am used to is different , of orthopedic grade. Here it was soft and affects sleep. Overall good!"
Oct 2016,50,Vacation in Portugal,My husband and I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel for a week and had a wonderful stay the entire time. We stayed in the executive room which came with access to the executive lounge. The whole team was very courteous and helpful. The hotel was clean and beautiful. The breakfast was great with a lot of choices. I would definitely stay here again.
Oct 2016,50,Great Hotel with hearty staff,"Dear AllWe was very Happy in your Hotel in Lisbon. Many Thanks for this great service. It is one of the best 5 STar Hotel, where we have been until now. Keep going and maybe the next timeBest Regards T. and S."
Oct 2016,40,Excellent base for exploring Lisbon,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights and had a very pleasant stay.  The hotel is 3 or 4 mins walk from the metro/train station which meant we could easily get about the beautiful city.  We bought  a Viva  Viagem travel card each and topped them up with €20.  Using it in this Zapping way like an Oyster card means that bus or train journeys are only €1.25.  The Corinthia is a well equipped, maintained and present hotel.  The public areas are very smart.  We only had breakfasts in the restaurant and they were plentiful in choice and supply.Our bedroom was on 7th floor.  It was  compact and very comfortable although the pillows were a bit springy.All of the staff were very pleasant and friendly.  Check in took about 15 mins and was not as efficient as I would have expected."
Oct 2016,50,Great hotel,"Just spent 4 days at the Corinthia hotel. We can thoroughly recommend this hotel, ideal location, beautiful rooms and the food is excellent. Staff also very pleasant and helpful. It was our wedding anniversary while we were there, it was a lovely surprise to find a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates left in our room. We really enjoyed our stay in this excellent hotel."
Oct 2016,50,4 Days in Corithia,We had an excellent 4 days in Corinthia. The hotel was very good and the reception staff were very welcoming.Room was great and gym and pool were very good. The security system is excellent .Food was very good in the restaurant
Oct 2016,50,Best of the Best!,"Our stay was outstanding.  The staff have total top quality customer service.Highly recommend this hotel.  Food was good. Near public transportation. The bar had entertainment, which was terrific. Everyone was super!"
Oct 2016,50,Such fun,"Had a great stay, staff attentive but not to over the top.Natasha at reception made our arrival smooth. Even  though we were early she called Monica in the executive lounge. Who was waiting for myself and husband as we stepped out of the lift. She showed us around the lounge and made us feel very welcome. Last but by no means least, the bar staff. Cocktails great,staff remembering you from your previous night."
Oct 2016,50,"Cozy, Perfect","Clean and Very Comfortable, Good breakfast,  Friendly and helpful staff - notified us about the Taxi strike and help organise transport to the Airport, Great Location; Proximity to the bus & metro stations.  Was convenient for our stay."
Oct 2016,50,Luxury with excellent service,Staying at the Corinthia at the moment.The hotel is very conveniently located near the metro and only a few stops away from the main tourist attractions near Baxia-Chiado. The hotel is very comfortable and the service is excellent.Would recommend it to anyone.The Spa and swimming pool are definitely worth a visit.
Oct 2016,50,Very friendley atmospher.,"Very satisfactory overall.,Open and enjoyable surrounding.Plenty  of food variatablity Central loction safety is reliable.poor sockets for electric sockets for example to charge telephone and I pad.good luck."
Oct 2016,50,Very nice hotel,Hotel is situated outside city centre but 100m away from metro. Therefore very easy access. Very large shopping mall colombo can be reached by metro within 5min. Very friendly stuff and amazing breakfast
Oct 2016,50,Visit in  Lisboa,Very nice visit in Lisboa with friends. We had an excellent stay at the Corinthia. The Metro was situated just a couple of minutes from the hotel so it was very easy to come to the central part of Lisboa.
Oct 2016,30,Loyalty?,"Nice hotel. Slow to check in. After spending 8 nights in the hotel, disappointed to find out that NONE of these count to the loyalty program, 'because they were not booked directly on the website'.  What kind of loyalty program is that?"
Oct 2016,40,Lisbon 4 days,"Hotel was very comfortable and the room temperature was great because the aircon would stop once it reaches a temperature.However- you have to pay separately to use the spa. You only have swimming pool included for the average room price.  So that was slightly disappointing as other 5 star hotels I've been to includes not just the pool, but also the steam room and sauna in the room price.I chose through last minute secret escape - and I recommend to go do this mysterious cheaper choice for 5 star hotels. If its for 4 star hotel- I ended up getting a room in Barcelona that I would rate as 2 star only (The Barcelona Ilunion)"
Oct 2016,30,Average,"Location- is a little bit faraway from main  sights , room service - food variation is very poor and price is too expensive for the quality , housekeeping service- very good. Laundry and dry cleaning- very expensive."
Oct 2016,50,Outstanding!,The best hotel experience ever. When we checked in we were told that we were the 'guest of the day' which meant an upgrade to an executive suite and access to the executive lounge for the duration of our 3 night stay. We were also given a complimentary spa treatment! The staff are very attentive and friendly. We will definitely be returning.
Oct 2016,40,First time city break in Lisbon,"The location was a little further away from the centre than we liked but the public transport was quite close by, once we got to grips with the ticketing system, it was not a big problem. Apart from a few little issues, the hotel was a very comfortable stay, the staff friendly and good value for money when we booked through ebookers.com"
Oct 2016,50,Very friendly staff great hotel,"The staff went out of there way to be helpful and we're always friendly, the pool was lovley and the bar and garden made a lovley place to relax in the evening with piano being played or music, the rooms are lovley and very clean."
Oct 2016,50,Great stay in Lisbon,All perfect from welcoming to end and especialy at executive lounge. Clean and spacious room. Great location between Airport and city... on the metro line for weekend gateway. Recommended adress in Lisbon...
Oct 2016,50,Excellent base for a city break,"We (a family of 4 adults) were visiting Lisbon for the first time.  The Corinthia is not only a very short taxi ride from the airport, but also near a metro station offering rapid access to the city centre.  In five days, we were easily able to see all the main sights as well as visiting both Sintra and the beach at Cascais.  The hotel staff provided excellent advice and assistance on getting around.The range of options at the buffet breakfast was excellent (although we would have preferred to have pots of coffee at the table rather than having to summon a waiter for every cup), as was the choice of buffet or a la carte dinner. But the best catering facility was the Executive Club Lounge, where delicious drinks and snacks were available at any time, along with superb views over the city.We did not make use of the spa or the pool, but found the gym very good indeed."
Oct 2016,50,Business Followed by Pleasure,Our company had 4 days of meetings here and then my wife and I stayed afterwards and enjoyed ourselves. It's not too close to downtown but close enough for a quick Uber or cab ride. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and overall our stay here was quite enjoyable.
Oct 2016,40,Expensive corporate type hotel,"If you are looking for a high end corporate type experience, this is your place.  Cocktails are chique but pricey. At the Típico restaurant the buffet has a great selection, but the quality ofthe seafood is not as high as what you will get at seafood specialty restaurants in Lisbon.  Service is top notch, and wines a good value.  The a lá carte menu is also pricey, compared to smaller establishments that specialize in seafood."
Oct 2016,50,Clean and besutifull,"It was nice hotel , i liked there Hop on hop off station it was near the hotel and we use it as a public bus and it was easy for finding historical places with hop on hop off and visit them and back to hotel again , in while i like to go that hotel again"
Oct 2016,20,Extremely disappointed.,"I must start by saying that based on other reviews and the hotel's reputation, I had very high expectations, which unfortunately, were not met at all.I tried to book an Executive Suite at the last minute as I hadn't yet confirmed my travel plans and was travelling for business, and unfortunately I was not able to book any room online via their website, and when I called to check on room availability, they said that no rooms were available at all (not even regular rooms), which was unusual for a Sunday and Monday booking. Therefore, I booked a regular room (at a similar rate offered by the hotel itself) through a third party who suggested that I upgrade when I arrive at the hotel.I chose this particular hotel as I thought that it would be conveniently located to the major attractions and accessible; however, I was disappointed. I took the Aerobus from the airport to the hotel which took approximately 20 minutes and dropped me off right outside the door. When I arrived, although I had a confirmation number and had paid in advance, they had no confirmation of my booking on their end, which led to a very lengthy delay. Furthermore, I was unable to upgrade to an Executive Suite or even to any other room aside from the one on the 6th floor I was given, with a view of mostly a concrete wall. I asked about access to the Executive Lounge so that I could hold my meetings, which was 50 euros/day, and ultimately did not feel that it warranted the cost just to have a meeting, so I opted out. During my 2 day stay, I had additional issues attempting to obtain room service, where no one would answer the line, despite me waiting for up to half an hour. Similarly, the reception desk agents were unable to provide me with information regarding transportation or the city in general and referred me to the Information desk that was unattended. Furthermore, despite me hanging the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on my door, my room was entered by housekeeping and I had to phone the reception desk to inform them of such. I am always cognizant of keeping my business documents and electronics protected given the requirements of my work, and thus I typically request that housekeeping not enter.The room: Although my room had a poor view, it had a comfortable bed with a nicely equipped bathroom with a robe and slippers provided. There were hardly any outlets in the room to use at all which made it difficult for me to charge my electronics. There was a hot water kettle with instant coffee, but no coffee machine, and no ice machine available.The hotel itself: The highlight of my stay was the fantastic gym, and although I didn't use the spa or pool, these seemed quite nice. Outside, there was a lovely patio/bar area that you can actually see from the gym, and at the time I was there, they had a very large TV outside in this area as well. There is wifi in the hotel, although it did cut out sometimes. I did not eat any meals at the hotel itself, but I attempted to order room service, although there was no answer. I did not observe that the restaurants or bar in the hotel were particularly busy at any time, and although the outdoor patio was lovely, this also remained empty.Surrounding area: The hotel is located approximately 15-20 minutes driving time away from the hotel, and although it is located to the zoo, there isn't much else nearby with limited dining options. They do have a metro station that is a few minutes walk from the hotel itself, where you can catch a train to Sintra (approximately 40 mins) or to Baixa/Chiado/Rossio (approximately 15-20 minutes). I preferred to walk to the downtown area, stopping at the Gulbenkian museum which is approximately 15 minutes away walking, Marques de Pombel Park and El Corte Ingles, which is about the same distance. It took me approximately 45-50 minutes to walk to Rossio and the downtown area, but it was a very pleasant walk down the main avenue that is lined with high end luxury boutiques.Upon leaving, I attempted to obtain directions on how to make my way back to the airport (aside from taxis which I had had bad experiences with in Lisbon and decided against) and was given inaccurate and poor directions by multiple staff on how to get there by Aerobus and Metro.Overall, although others may find this to be a 5* hotel, my experience (as someone travelling for business and pleasure) was not the same, and my expectations were not at all met. I cannot justify the cost of staying here, nor would I recommend it, especially if you would truly like to experience Lisbon."
Oct 2016,50,Very comfortable and enjoyable Stay,"Had a wonderful stay here. The location was excellent a little outside the city but this should not worry you in the slightest. It is only 10 minutes to the airport, Has a metro stop about 5 mins away and it conveniently located on one of the hop on hop off bus routes if your looking to do some sight seeing around the city on a short time frame. The service we received at the Corinthia was excellent minus one small misunderstanding relating to a getting some hot water to take some medicine (Bar man came out with just a pot of hot water but no cup to drink it from). The Breakfast buffet was amazing and probably one f the best I've come across. Had dinner in the Tipico restaurant on our final night and kind of sorry we didn't dine there every night. The prices were extremely reasonable. We selected of meal from the al la carte menu and it was just divine. We weren't far off from licking our plates clean it was that delicious. Would happily recommend the Corinthia for both business or pleasure. Thank you very much for an enjoyable relaxing stay."
Oct 2016,30,OK Hotel Nothing Special,"Check-in was easy, especially as we had a funny reservation where there were two of us one night and then three of us for the following nights so we needed an extra bed in the room.  Outside bar is pretty but service was average and you are paying hotel prices.  Breakfast buffet was good with a decent selection of hot and cold items.  Check-out there was quite a queue so we were waiting a while.  Hotel is a bit out of the way so if you are looking for lots of nightlife then this one probably is not for you."
Oct 2016,50,"Excellent hotel, great restaurant, coeliac friendly!","The hotel bed was one of the best I've encountered. I slept really well, which is normally a struggle for me in hotels.The rooms were great, air conditioned, good amenities. Truly a 5 star experience.Most of the staff had good English and they were all very friendly and helpful.I have coeliac disease and need strictly gluten free meals with no cross contamination. When I arrived, the woman at the customer service desk asked the chef at the hotel's restaurant to come out and speak with me. I was attended a conference that provided catered buffet style meals, and I'm nervous about eating off of buffets. He offered to prepare me a separate meal each time, and asked about my tastes and preferences. The meals he prepared were simple (as requested) and delicious. The staff even created a gluten free table for snacks, when we had breaks during the day, so I could enjoy the breaks. The buffet food was also labeled with gluten/meat/dairy content which was useful for the other attendees.Most importantly, I didn't get sick from the food!There was a supermarket and green grocer across the road as well, and a minibar (without sensors) in the room to store food."
Oct 2016,50,Our Stay in Corinthia hotel Lisabon,The hotel offeres generous space which is tasty furnished. Stuf act professionally and provides excelent service. View/panorama over Lisbon from lodge on 24-TH floor was fantastic. Breakfast was of highest class.
Oct 2016,50,Elegance,Old world elegant hotel catering to customers who expect top notch service.  I made the hotel aware that we were celebrating our 43rd wedding anniversary.  They were very gracious/generous with a room upgrade/chocolate dipped strawberries/champagne.  I booked a room with access to the executive lounge (much better than the red level lounge at Gran Melia colon in Seville).  A short metro ride to major tourist area.  Highly recommended!
Oct 2016,50,nice hotel for business and relax,I was there for business trip but would reccoment this hotel for couples or family relax vacation. Food in the hotel are good - it tasty not expensive and have local flavor. SPA bit expensive but reasonable. Pool are free of charge and has a sunbathing terrace. Elevators are programmed outside of the cabin so no expect floor buttons inside.
Oct 2016,50,The best hotel !,Fabulous ! Situated next door to a main underground hub station puts everything in reaching distance including airport transfer by train too. The staff were super friendly and we received an upgrade to the sky lounge on arrival. We had an amazing view of the bridge and Christ the Redeemer replica. Breakfast was plentiful and tasty. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Not a bad word to say .
Oct 2016,40,"Lovely stay, made to feel very special indeed","It was my wife's 30th birthday and they made us feel very welcome, gave us a complementary bottle of wine, chocolates and a free hours experience in the aqua area, which was totally amazing. We had a lovely massage and had access to the executive lounge which is a must as all day they have drinks, bites to eat, a fantastic view, it really is brilliant. Also the breakfast there is unreal, really really good, one of the best I've had. I will say our room which was an executive needed a little upgrading, carpets wallpaper etc, Im being fussy to be fair for the price but it is called executive!Its a little bit out of the way to the downtown areas of Lisbon but when an Uber is only 7-9 euros and a train station across the road its no problem for us. Also a direct train takes you 30 mins to Sintra....which you HAVE to see. I would recommend this place to anyone and have no hesitation in coming back. The staff were great, well done Corinthia:)"
Oct 2016,50,Very Good Hotel !,"I enjoyed very much  my stay in the Hotel. Great hotel, spacious rooms, prompt and friendly staff. The Corinthia is an excellent choice to stay in Lisbon. I spent 5 nights at this hotel and the staff made my stay a pleasant one for me."
Oct 2016,50,By Mellors,"My husband and I visited Lisbon and stayed at he Corinthia hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary. What a gem! We had the most wonderful time, right from the hotel limousine pick up from the airport, and a lovely surprise of bottle of champagne and strawberries! The staff were helpful and friendly, the service excellent and the food in the hotel restaurant and buffet breakfast great.  Great hotel, would recommend.  We spent 3 nights at the hotel and wish we stayed longer, so plan to go again soon. Easy access to city centre by bus or metro."
Oct 2016,50,Fabulous hotel in a great location,"I took my wife here for a birthday treat.  The hotel exceeded all my expectations with friendly staff, fantastic facilities and an excellent breakfast each morning.  I picked a city view room and we were rewarded with lovely views.  Anybody who is concerned that the hotel is some distance from the city centre should not worry. Almost next door to the hotel is the railway and metro stations.  We travelled all over the city using the metro which is both efficient and clean.  It is also very reasonably priced at 1.40 euros for any length journey including the journey from the airport to the hotel.  We would recommend going to Sintra whilst in Lisbon; a truly wonderful place to visit with so much to see.  The journey takes about 30 minutes with regular trains going from the station over the road from the hotel.  The fare again is very cheap by UK standards."
Oct 2016,50,a very pleasant cosy stay,we had room 1807 a spacious large room well apointed with good amenities.  fine daily maid service. good beds and towels.excellent breakfast with a rich variety of all you may desire. the swimming pool and spa are recomendable.  overall had a most enjoyable stay.
Oct 2016,50,Great family stay,"We booked a executive queen and got upgraded  to a junior suit for our weekend stay. Airport pickup was really comfortable and prompt. Executive floor definitely work the extra few euro. View amazing. Lovely relaxing environment to chill with our baby for a while in the afternoon and evening. Food and drinks were perfect for our needs. Good variety. Restaurant buffet in the main restaurant was good quality and the a la carte menu was also good. In general, staff in the hotel were wonderful, couldn't do enough to help. Atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming. Hotel only about 100m from metro, train and yellow bus (hop on /off stop). Pool amazing but busy in the afternoon.I was very impressed with this hotel and the service we got."
Oct 2016,50,"A large smart, business Hotel.","The location, some 15 minutes from the Centre of Lisbon on the Metro*(Jardim Zoologico, Blue line nearest entrance 3 minutes walk) is good if you do not like being in the hectic centre of a city. It is near a main railway line (Sete Rios) and a motorway - However I was on the 16th Floor and it was very quiet. There are a few restaurants near the Hotel - but little else. The Calouste Gulenkian museum is 10 minutes walk away and with it's gorgeous gardens a must (entrance €10).The reception area is very smart and the staff at the desks friendly and efficient. once I had worked out that you have to select your floor and touch your room key before entering the elevator whose number you are given, I made it to my 16th floor room. I had a superior double, which was spacious and well appointed. the furniture all good and the views, whislt over the more modern part of Lisbon, very good.Service of the rooms was very good. The pool area on the 2nd floor, very smart and clean. I did not use the spa services but the list looked good. BE ADVISED. you have to have a bathing cap to enter the pool.(they sell them but I had one).Breakfast, a full buffet, was very comprehensive and good quality. As this is a business hotel, if there is an event on the breakfast room can get very busy before 9am.The restaurant 'Tipico' has a buffet lunch/dinner or 'al la carte. I had the Buffet (€29.50) with a glass (125ml) of so-so wine. I t was just above ok, but good value. The Bar is great with an outside section and the waiting staff efficient and friendly.Also the prices are reasonable for a 5* Hotel. Bar food good.I enjoyed my stay and rarely did it's distance from the centre bother me.If you like to be in the heart of it all, this is probably not your first choice, but a hotel of similar quality nearer the centre, would cost a fair bit more.*Metro - buy a card €0.50, similar to 'Oyster' in London and load it with cash, which can be topped up at any machine in stations and balance checked. This makes ALL journeys in the large central zone (which INCLUDES the airport) only €1.40 a journey. You can use it on all forms of transport in Lisbon, although some trips will be more (there are 5 zones)"
Oct 2016,50,Business conference,"The hotel is a good place for a conference.Unfortunately our agenda didn't allowed us to enjoy spa, swimming pool and other recreation resources but the hotel seemed well organized, efficient and clean.The staff is very kindGood restaurant"
Oct 2016,40,Perfect stay in Lisbon.,"Great hotel, spacious rooms, prompt and friendly staff and good food - of this is what your are looking for then Corinthia is an excellent choice to stay in Lisbon. We spent 5 nights at this hotel and the staff made our stay a pleasant one for us."
Oct 2016,40,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel, ideal if needing a hotel close to the airport. Rooms are functional with very comfortable beds, and breakfast has so much quality selection of foods it's difficult to chose what to eat!Buses for downtown Lisbon departure from outside the hotel, taxi's too are also readily available outside the hotel. If you would like to take a train to Sintra, the train is a few minutes walk from the hotel.All in all, this is a great hotel to stay for any purpose, business and holidays."
Oct 2016,50,First Visit to Lisbon,"My stay was amazing from start to finish.  When I arrived, I did not realize that there was a separate check in for the Executive level.   I was escorted to a representative that made sure was check in went smoothly.   My daily trips to the Executive Lounge was great with a great panoramic view of the city.  The location was ideal to get me to various parts of the city.  Would recommend this location."
Oct 2016,40,Airport closer than the city centre,"Well staffed, and nice rooms with good views from the higher floors.  However the swimming pool is indoors on the second floor, and the bar prices were exceptionally high ( small beer 7 Euros, bottle of average white wine 60 euros!).The station is nearby, but the hotel location out of the city centre means that a taxi (not expensive) or the metro is needed.  Breakfast at 18 euros is also best avoided.  Local cafes were ideal for breakfast.Minus point were the bedroom windows that were in great of need more regular cleaning.A decent rather characterless 'city' hotel, that could have been anywhere in the world really..."
Oct 2016,40,"Clean, comfortable and lovely staff","We loved the hotel but found that some of the amenities shown on the website required extra fees. Obviously one would expect to pay for spa services and beauty treatments but the jacuzzi should be free. Likewise the bar at the top of the hotel was only available if we paid an extra €69 per room. Given that drinks in the bar were €12 each it seemed pretty far fetched to ask for a fee to just visit the roof top bar. I would also recommend a more reasonable,lunch. We noticed most people went out to eat as the restaurants were too expensive. We went to another hotel and had a three course lunch for €14.50 each. By the time we bought wine the price had risen and they made a tidy profit. The Corinthia could generate more business with a mid price menu each day. We also had two rooms booked together. However we were placed on the 8th and 18th floor. I would have expected to be at least on the same floor as the rest of my family. Still this is a good hotel, lovely staff and comfortable rooms."
Oct 2016,50,vIERA,"Very nice hotel with vey nice room and excellent service,nice location and hotel is close to metro station and zoo,rooms are clean and comfortable with perfect internet and wifi connection :-),:-),:-).:-),:-),:-),:-),:-),:-),:-)."
Oct 2016,50,Quality of sleep!,"Having a good sleep makes or break holiday. Corinthia scored 10/10 on that. Room is spacious and fresh. Thanks for the free bottle of water that was handy as it was so hot outside. View from my room was not dull nor interestingLocation is perfect for touring as it is close to both the train and metro stations,  Main bus terminal is also close by.Very close to main road and also surrounded by small roads, once inside you hardly notice or hear any noise. Staffs are professionals and friendly."
Oct 2016,50,Very nice hotel,"Rooms are very  clean and comfortable. You can have a relaxing sleep in silence. Hotel is very close to metro station, but to go to the downtown I recommend to take a walk. Meeting venues are well designed. Hospitality and kindness are the most powerful things that make the hotel preferable."
Sep 2016,50,"Modern, high-rise elegance","One of the reasons I decided to stay at Corinthia Lisbon was that a year earlier I was a guest of Corinthia Budapest which I enjoyed very much. This time around, I also was not disappointed. Unlike the stylish, 19-th century Budapest hotel, its Lisbon counterpart is very modern. My nineteenth floor room was extremely comfortable, quiet, and afforded a beautiful panorama of the Portuguese capital (including the airplanes approaching the airport). Upon arrival in a taxi, a porter quickly whisked my luggage, and without even asking my name, made the suitcase appear in my quarters. The receptionists were very handsome ladies, speaking commendable English, courteous and efficient without being bombastic (which sometimes may be the case in a 5-star establishment). The very tasty in-room breakfast which I ordered for next morning, arrived promptly at the desired time on a sizable cart (I was rather hungry), and was even a bit less expensive than the lavish Budapest buffet breakfast. The only detail that I found somewhat difficult was their elevator system; the elevator is supposed to read you card key and decide on that basis which floor it will go to... some kind of ""avant-garde"" approach which was not fully comprehensible to an old-timer such as myself. I would have much preferred the traditional buttons-with-numbers system.As for price - I found it reasonable given the standard, however, it might have had something to do with the fact that I booked with them well in advance - which usually is much easier on your wallet."
Sep 2016,50,Excellent Lisbon hotel,"Location, amenities, accommodation, food and service were all outstanding for our three day stay.Check in and out processes were flawless.Cleanliness and room size and bed comfort were excellent as was the food."
Sep 2016,50,Vacation,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia Hotel, from the moment we started getting messages on hotel information from the staff on-line. To when we were picked up from the airport desp[ite delays that occurred during our flight that were out of control. I really want to thank everyone for their kindness, and professionalism. I would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend this hotel to my friends."
Sep 2016,40,Great place to stay in Lisbon,If you want a reasonably price good location hotel this is the place - good restaurants both in hotel and nearby. Also easy to get around close to downtown and shopping - el cort ingles and major mall not far.
Sep 2016,40,Great Lisbon Hotel,"You are spoilt at the Corinthia from the moment you are met at the entrance by a top hatted porter until you leave. The reception is efficient and the lounges light and filled with flowers. Our room was clean and housekeeping seemed efficient. The outside Terrace lounge is a great place to relax after a long day, listen to the live music with a glass or two of wine. Make sure you take the breakfast buffet option as this is excellent with a good selection of hot and cold dishes. A small point, it might be an idea to have someone from the spa on hand to make sure that the pool regulations such as wearing a cap and stopping people from jumping in are obeyed. We would certainly return to the Corinthia on our next visit to this wonderful city."
Sep 2016,50,Very good choice for a 5 star,"There are several 5 star hotels in Lisbon but truth be told some of them don't deserve the status and some others are way too expensive ... This hotel has probably the best service I've ever seen while keeping the prices reasonably for common people like me. The restaurant is excellent and the choice of wines is really good. Also, if possible go check the magnificent SPA. The breakfast is expensive is not included in the stay; is included you won't be disappointed. In short a good choice."
Sep 2016,30,This is no Corinthia Budapest ,"Our first experience with the Corinthia hotel chain was at the Corinthia Budapest. It was an exceptional hotel and we were therefore expecting a higher standard when we booked the Corinthia Lisboa. The Lisbon hotel lobby is beautiful. The reception was pleasant and the staff in the Executive Lounge were terrific - very, very helpful (esp. Monica). The rooms were small and poorly appointed. The carpet in our room was worn and paint had stripped off the wall in places. There were only two electrical outlets and they could only function when the lights were on - forget about charging your iPhone overnight AND getting sleep. There was no iron and ironing board (although the housekeeping staff brought one when requested). But the room was so small that there was little space to iron the clothes anyway. And the elevator system was unnecessarily complicated. You are expected to present your room key card when calling the elevator and punch in the number of the floor you intend to reach. The console then directs you to the correct elevator for your journey. This neither saves time nor reduces the number of elevator cars required but I saw staff explaining its operation to several guests. And one of the two consoles on the 11th floor didn't work."
Sep 2016,40,Lisbon Holiday,"The Corinthia Hotel is excellent and our bed in the Junior Suite was very comfortable. Breakfast is very good with lots of fresh fruit and full English, all of the staff are very friendly and could not have helped more. The only small problem is that the room we stayed in had only one spare electric socket which for todays connected world is not enough, I bought a 4 gang extension for 3 Euros from a local shop but this needs to be sorted out. The Dinner Buffet must be tried with a Chef on duty to cook your meats and fish there and then. Nearby there are some excellent cafes and restaurants, with access to the Metro and main line system 150 metres away."
Sep 2016,50,Great stay!,Daniel and Maira in the Club Lounge were outstanding and were wonderful to us! Sonia at the front desk was helpful and made sure we were attended to after a long trip! Room was amazing and real comfortable. Overall service was exceptional!
Sep 2016,50,Another great visit...,"...back again, as we always have such a great time and the staff are extremely friendly and accommodating in every way.  As a seasoned guest at this hotel. I can honestly praise all the staff here.  Although we have seen some changed in staff over the summer, they have always been most helpful and friendly. The front of house staff in reception are always there to help with any queries, Domingos and Roque on the door are happy to welcome you. Sky Lounge is worth the upgrade to access. The staff there again cannot be faulted. Monica, Maira, Rita, Margarida.  Ana Rossario also very helpful and her team.  Valter is the chef and always has my preferred eggs ready each morning. Daniel - Exec Club Host is superb.  Always remembers our preferences, and is always keen to serve all his guests.  One the two evenings he was not working, it was obvious by his absence.  He definitely has the lounge running like clockwork. Finally praise must go to Sandra Abrantes who runs the guest services team and must be proud of her staff. All have great customer service skills and good knowledge of Lisbon and surrounding attractions. The hotel itself is well appointed out of the main noise and bustle but easily accessible by metro and taxis are very reasonable.  There are a variety of eateries, Tipico serves each evening a buffet style and also alacarte. Also, the terrace lounge bar has a good menu and always enjoyed out meals there.  They have a large outside terrace bar which in this weather is great to sit outside and enjoy a cocktail or two...The rooms we have always found to be of great standard.  The housekeeping staff do a great job and always have our room ready for when we return in the afternoon for a break from the sun. Spa: the hotel spa has recently been taken over and is now run directly by the hotel, which is an improvement.  Excellent choice of treatments, swimming pool is relaxing and there is also a sun terrace for those who want to dry off in the sun.  There is only one negative comment I would make - the ""piped"" music in the executive lounge and lifts is atrocious.  We have been coming here for two years and it's the same loop of jazz and so called easy listening, but it's very annoying. Please change the tape!!Anyway...can't fault the hotel and its staff. We are back in December."
Sep 2016,50,"My wife and l have recently returned from a four day stay which was excellent,","My wife and l have recently returned from a four day stay which was excellent, we were upgraded to a junior suite which is always a nice start to a break. Breakfast ,service and the room cleaning were all excellent, positioned close to the metro and armed with a Lisboa card we visited all the sights, the highlight of Lisbon for us has to be the food simply exceptional. Well worth a visit. Mr and Mrs Lee."
Sep 2016,50,Excellent service and amazing beds.,"Recently returned to Corinthia Lisbon for a second stay.  The service of this hotel is outstanding.  Every member of staff has service in their hearts.This hotel may seem ""out of the way"" but its location to the zoo (5 min walk) makes for an excellent day out.  The Metro stop (2 mins) is also very convenient for getting into Lisbon central (10 mins on the blue line). Proximity to city centre IS NOT a reason to avoid this hotel.The Executive Club is a pricey addition to your stay, but I would recommend it.  It is great to have an escape to tranquility for a drink and some snacks (the bar is not cheap!).  The breakfast is outstanding and the chef-on-hand is a great additional touch.  I would say that the snack menu requires more thought and variety as after 2 days of crudites and cheese only it is a little boring.  Introduce more salad items would be my suggestion."
Sep 2016,50,Corinthia hotel visit,"Corinthia hotel is a great hotel for business or for Leisure. it was nearby the centre so you didn,t have to travel long. the room was Always clean and there was Always nice staff. the pool was clean and the gym was open for 24 hours so it was quiet when you wanted to work out. overall it was a excellent hotel and i'm coming back soon."
Sep 2016,40,Great hotel! ,Lovely hotel with fabulous rooms. We were really lucky to have a room on the 19th floor and had a stunning view of Lisbon. The bar area and patio is great and the food is good. The pool area is lovely and very relaxing. Would highly recommend a stay here!
Sep 2016,30,Not up to 5* rating,"First of all, the positives: polite check-in and check- out staff, timely room service, housekeeping was polite and friendly. Turn-down service was pleasant and the hotel provided a good range of toiletries and replenished frequently. Very close to the Metro station which was great for day excursions and it is well situated from the airport- about 15 minutes maximum. Negatives: the morning breakfast didn’t have the best variety for a 5*. Lacked in quality. Tea and coffee were served lukewarm to cold. Most of the staff, although pleasant, were unable to speak English which led to some confusion! The on-site restaurant for dinner, Tipico, was not much better. The buffet looked disappointing so we ordered a-la carte. This led to an hour wait for our starter- and the restaurant wasn't busy! Drinks also took over half an hour to arrive and I had to prompt the waiter to bring me a drink and wine list. We also found that there were little things which let the overall experience down.  In our suite, the furniture was scratched, one day the pillowcases had holes in them after being changed and the carpet had some stains on it. I also read in another review that there were not enough plug points and I can confirm this- we had one plug point to rotate our electrical items with! I had very high hopes for the hotel and overall experience, but unfortunately they did not live up to 5* standards. For the cost of the hotel and facilities, the service and quality wasn't there. Disappointing."
Sep 2016,50,Exceptional,Fantastic service. The staff were polite and helpful.Conveniently located. Not too far from the airport and a stones throw away from the metro.The room was lovely and so were the restaurants and bars at the premises. The spa facilities were the icing on the cake
Sep 2016,50,100% success,"Very good organization during 4 days for Business, all the Teams were very professional.A place to go and go back. Good service at all the levels. Nice meeting rooms. Good restaurants even when you have food restrictions! Thanks to everybody!"
Sep 2016,40,Superb for business conference,"Excellent all round experience for our company conference. High quality, stylish, professional without being too corporate. I liked the high tech lift system too. Very efficient. One small suggestion is to provide an iron and ironing board in bedrooms."
Sep 2016,30,Beautiful Hotel for Lisbon Visit,"Lovely hotel, great amenities, nice pool and gym. Executive lounge is superb and has a breathtaking view of Lisbon City.   All the staff is courteous except the guest services head who refused to give 2 bottles of water for 3 guests staying in a Junior Suite...this is on our 3rd night here just randomly they decide to give us 1 bottle of water at the end of the day when we are too tired to go out to get water.  All is fab but they need to be polite & understanding of certain issues.  It's sad when poor response by 1 or 2 staff pulls down the over all hotel rating! The corinthia in Budapest is par excellence compared to this Lisbon one!"
Sep 2016,40,Very nice stay,"Very nice modern hotel, very courteous and helpful  staff. Room was very clean and service was excellent. Great location for public transportation across the street. Easy to get to and from the airport. Would recommend for business, couples or by yourself."
Sep 2016,50,Top notch visit to a great hotel,"Spend 4 days in Lisbon at ten Corinthia.  What a great hotel.  Top notch staff, facilities, great beds, wonderful restaurants.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Each evening, after a hard day slogging  up and down the hills of Lisbon it felt like we were coming home.  Hotel is a short walk to the subway (blue line) so you can be in the action is a few stops.  It's also a very short drive to the airport (12 Euros)"
Sep 2016,50,Excellent and inexpensive,"A beautiful hotel with excellent amenities.I stayed there for business and was impressed with the quality at a much lower price than I would have expected. I would definitely stay there again, for either business or pleasue."
Sep 2016,40,Absolutely fine ,"Stayed here three nights for a business meeting and no complaints. Meeting facilities were good and the staff were attentive. The hotel had one of the best WiFi connections I have experienced in a hotel.  There is a good bar area with nice outside seating.  Rooms are comfortable with no issues, apart from a chronic lack of electrical sockets in any useful place!"
Sep 2016,50,Incredible Hotel,Extraordinary staff. Beautiful hotel with outstanding service. I wanted to stay in Lisbon just because of the hotel. Would be perfect if hotel were closer to the city center. The outdoor patio bar is wonderfully relaxing in the evening.
Sep 2016,50,A true dream,"We spent there seven beautiful days in our Honeymoon. A dream!The hotel is very well placed and it is a real five star hotel with all facilities and more.The employees are friendly and helpful. The Executive Club is warm, comfortable and excellent maintained by amazing people. Special thanks to Monica and Daniel!We will miss the very tasty omelettes made by very good and friendly chefs.The room was always clean and tidy. Thank you Ecaterina!The are careful at details.Thank you to all people working there!"
Sep 2016,50,Fantastic stay,"Stayed with a friend for a weekend break and what a fantastic hotel this is. The hotel is clean, modern and the staff are so friendly,helpful and approachable. I must mention all the staff in the Executive lounge who made us feel so welcome, and especially Daniel who greeted us every morning for Breakfast with a smile. Cannot wait to return."
Sep 2016,20,Rude Bar Staff Tarnished Stay,"Nice rooms, clean hotel and good wifi.  Unfortunately the attitude of some of the older male bar staff upset us so much that it tarnished the stay. The rudeness and lack of customer service was appalling and I wonder how someone could get away with such atrocious customer service.  It occurred on more than 1 occasion and really was unbelievable how rude someone could be to a paying guest.  It was only the older male bar staff.  The females and younger males obviously had a better attitude and valued their guests and employment."
Sep 2016,50,Very good hotel with tasty food,"There is a very good hotel with good breakfast and helpful staff. Everything was good and comfortable during our 5 days business trip. Breakfast is perfect, Wi-Fi works good, there is a swimming pool with a terrace. Don't forget a swimming cap ( anyway u can buy in a spa center).  taxi is always available , metro is near:-)) there is a big shopping center 15 min by walk; and the biggest art museum of Lisbon -Calouste Gulbenkian also 10-15 min by walk"
Sep 2016,50,Fantastic stay ,"We spent 3 nights at the wonderful Hotel Corinthia Lisbon last week.  It was simply fantastic for our family of 3  (including 17 month old daughter).  I was in touch with the hotel a few times before arrival to arrange our airport transfers (including toddler car seat); specify a non-smoking and to arrange champagne and chocolate for my husband as we were arriving on his birthday.  Each time I contacted them they replied quickly and fully. We'd decided to upgrade our room to an Executive one before arrival as the price wasn't that much more than just having breakfast at the hotel and this would give us access to the Executive Club.  On arrival we were met by Margarida who was looking out for us.  She checked us in and informed us that she'd upgraded us to a suite as they didn't have any non-smoking rooms available.  This was a lovely gesture and it was helpful having the two rooms with an active toddler to entertain.  Whilst we were checking in the doorman was making our little one laugh which helped keep her entertained.  The room was on 22nd floor and the views over the city were amazing.  Our little one enjoyed watching the planes flying over (no noise).  As requested, they'd left the champagne and chocolates in the room.  About an hour after we arrived they also sent a birthday cake up to the room courtesy of the hotel - again, a lovely touch.  A cot was set up in the room for us - though she preferred our king size bed - and they even left some baby friendly toiletries in it for our use.  The room was cleaned well every day and we enjoyed the chocolates left on the pillow. The Executive Club was a lovely quiet space which we used in for breakfast in the morning and for downtime in the afternoons after sightseeing.  There was a range of lovely food, hot drinks, beer, wine and soft drinks.  The staff seemed to work long hours but we're always really friendly, professional and helpful.  Our little one was spoilt with attention and we found Lisbon generally a really child-friendly place (though it's best to use a baby carrier as the hills, narrow streets and cobbles aren't particularly suited to a stroller). Whilst the hotel isn't in the old city centre, it was really easy to get there via the metro which is a regular and cheap mode of transport.  It was easy to work out how to navigate it and the ticket machines all had English options so we could use the self-service options.  We also did a day trip to Sintra and the train station above the metro has a regular direct service there.  The neighbourhood around the hotel seems to be a mix of business, medical and hotels.  There was a little supermarket just up the street and a few restaurants around.  A huge thank you to everyone at the hotel for helping to make our first family holiday abroad so special.  If we ever return to Lisbon you'll be our first choice and we'll also recommend you to family and friends."
Sep 2016,40,Lovely hotel - but short of ironing boards,"Decor of hotel extremely nice and staff very friendly and food very tasty. Only problem was that a lot of people had turned up at the same time for a conference, and there were not enough ironing boards to go round, which meant that my shirt was unironed the next day which was a bit embarrassing."
Sep 2016,50,Chic & Great Service,"When you visit Corinthia Hotels it’s difficult to ever book another Hotel.  Lisbon Corinthia I just experienced and it’s top notch, fantastic rooms, great service in every department I visited, food to die for and super friendly staff which makes you feel at home.  I highly recommend this Hotel if you are looking for a nice and welcoming stay in Portugal."
Sep 2016,50,Do not go anywhere else!,The hotel is very comfortable and within easy reach of the centre. The service was excellent throughout - every single member of the staff being friendly and the same time highly professional. The room was equipped with all amenities and the view was excellent. Don't miss out on the spa and the indoor pool  which are amazing.I hope to go back soon.
Sep 2016,40,Great stay,Great stay large 5-star hotel. Well located in easy reach to any destination in Lisbon. Modern facilities with a great friendly atmosphere so characteristic o Portuguese hospitality.  Breakfast was phenomenal.
Sep 2016,40,Good stay,"Hotel is nice. Staff are friendly. Room was nice and clean, everything working. Bar and restaurant were good. Outside bar was nice!Although did not use the gym, spa or pool had a look at them and they seemed very good."
Sep 2016,40,Elegant hotel,"Hotel is very elegant. Service was good. People are very proper, however, I did not feel the warmth on some of the employees that already experienced in Portugal at other hotels. A great restaurant across the street, the Sete Mares restaurant."
Sep 2016,50,Great place,"Excellent location, not a center but very close, 10 minutes by underground.Quiet environment, the staff is very helpful and friendly. At any time any information is available. The room is good with all necessary facilities especially for those who plans to make a coffee in the morning. We stayed here with a boy, 5 years old and the room was ready with additional bed according to our request.I would like to suggest to clean the room.Cleaning the room has been done after the afternoon, it was a little bit strange but we have asked to do it in the morning and so was done. To sum up, it is very recommended place with a good price, a fine location, quiet atmosphere and a very friendly staff."
Sep 2016,50,Week away in Lisbon,"This is our second visit to this hotel in fact we like it so much that we will probably visit every year.The staff are amazing particularly in the executive lounge where full credit must go to Daniel and Monica who go overboard to make your stay an unforgettable experience. The bedrooms are really comfortable,and the views breathtaking.With the metro so close it is easy to get around Lisbon,and putting 6€ on a day pass allows unlimited travel on nearly everything including the elevator and trams etc.Breakfast in the executive lounge is a must with personal service from the staff and really nice food.Also throughout the day and evening there are unlimited drinks and snacks, including wine and beer.We were really sorry to leave and will soon book again."
Sep 2016,50,Excellent hotel - perfect - in the centre of Lisbon.,"I would rate this as the  best hotel of all the hotels  I have stayed in. Lovely rooms with breathtaking views of the Aqueduct and Monsanto Park, this hotel is just 10 minutes from the international airport .The staff are professional, courteous  and most helpful. They will go out of their way to attend to your every need and desire. The hotel is a model of cleanliness and elegance, both inside and outside.Their restaurants offers a variety of choices, to suit every palate,  at reasonable prices. They will willingly arrange to provide you with any additional request, be it lunch,  dinner or breakfast. As well as a luxurious spa and indoor pool. Together with a lovely outside area  for relaxation and recreation, including an outdoor bar.Looking forward to our next visit."
Sep 2016,50,A superb hotel with all the amenities,This is an excellent hotel with all the comforts of a  5 star establishment.  Staff were attentive and professional and the rooms well appointed as were the hotel amenities.  I would highly recommend this hotel.
Sep 2016,50,High precise standard,"Exactly what you expect of standard 5 star hotel chain. Clean, friendly, almost robotic)). I was greatly surprised with breakfast policy. People were coming after the end of the declared ending time and every one was welcomed. What was more surprising: utensils were refilling up to the last guest. Great!Located in the sky scrapers hotel and business zone. Good for doing business not for the Lisboa city experience))"
Sep 2016,40,Fine hotel with some pluses and minuses.,"We stayed here on pre cruise offering combined with an additional day for sightseeing. The hotel is in an OK location near the zoo and it is necessary to take the metro to many restaurants and attractions. The metro is easy to use. The rooms are spacious and generally comfortable. However, the hotel has rigged the A/C so that it is on or off based on your room key inserted in a slot as you enter the door. Ergo, if you take you key and go out the A/C is off. Not very pleasant in the hot Lisbon summer weather. You can game the system but housekeeping will probably pull any card you have substituted while you are out. While we were there the A/c blown the room and for the first time in my traveling experience they were able to make a repair in short order. Kudos to them. The breakfast is plentiful but really lacks in anything of appealing taste. Strange that the fruits were not very ripe given the country and their access to ripe fruits.The fitness center is well equipped and the staff was very helpful at all times. Like many other European hotels this one could use a face lift but is remains a reasonable value for the price."
Sep 2016,20,Corinthian dissapoint,"I considered this hotel because of the image I had about the London hotel, big mistake, nothing in common, not good, far better hotels for lesser prices than this one. Location is not good either, speccially if you want to know the city a bit, and like to walk, very few not good restaurants, the rooms are very standard rooms, we chose a junior suite that seemed like a standard room, food for breakfast is not good at all.Hotel seems outdated, and has a few nice perks.Like the indoor pool, or a terrace lounge that seems nice, but I did not use.Service is not good either, lots of srvera each minding their own bussiness, they lack a serious leadership and true commitment to Service.I wish this hotel the best, but it was my first and last time there."
Sep 2016,40,Good hotel near the zoo,"Overall impression: great, clean hotel with friendly staff.  Location: Easy drive from the airport and located near the zoo. Few minute walk from the metro and train station.  Half hour metro-ride from the main restaurant area which was annoying. There's a seafood restaurant across the street (Setes Mares) which I don't recommend though.Amenities: good, clean pool (btw, you need a swim cap, if, unlike me, you have hair); free wi-fi.Would I stay here again? I probably would pick a place closer to the downtown area to avoid having to take a metro every night.  BUT, the metro is easy to navigate and cheap."
Sep 2016,50,Wonderful Hotel,"The room was wonderful: perfectly quiet, incredibly comfortable bed, and luxurious feel to the entire hotel. The location of the hotel is convenient for a daytrip to Sintra as a metro center is directly across the street. I hope to return to Lisbon and would definitely want to stay at the Corinthia again!"
Sep 2016,40,First stop before cruise,"The hotel was part of a precruise package. Good service, room are clean free breakfast was plentiful and varied, Sat on the veranda which was beautiful staff spoke English well so it make communicating easy."
Sep 2016,50,excellent value for visiting Lisbon,"Very warm welcome followed by a well equipped wide room.The breakfast was remarkable rich and well served/The friendly and warm  attitude of the personal trying to help  uswith practical problems as were to find a restaurant, were to visit and how to get around in the city ect' were very helpfull"
Sep 2016,50,we will be back,we enjoyed our stay very much and we will return to the hotel and to Lisbon. we found food is excellent people friendly transport excellent The hotel staff very helpful at call time. Facilities bars restaurants wonderful
Sep 2016,40,A fair hotel in Lisbon,"Good location though a bit out of the city centre. The Staff are friendly except it is such a huge hotel with 500 guest rooms, but too few staff. The lifts are too high tech and confused to use. The lobby is very grand and high class. The room also very comfortable. The area is however surrounded also by so many clinics and hospitals. If you look for medical tourism, this is the right area."
Sep 2016,50,Friendly and clean,"Very good English by all staff. Very friendly and welcoming, shame I only stayed one night on business would like to come back and visit on holiday.Clean rooms lovely view and good choice at breakfast."
Sep 2016,50,5 Star Hotel with 6 Star Services and Facilities,"An unforgettable stay in Corinthia. Very Impressed with the service from checking in, service staff, house keeping, room service and facilities provided. Rooms are extremely spacious and cozy. Very prompt and helpful services from the front desk, information counter, restaurants, pool and spa counter. We had a friend that fell at the front door of the pool and she was attended by your staff promptly by taking ice and place it on her knee immediately to sooth down the swell. An amazing experience."
Sep 2016,50,Really good service,"Stayed here on holiday and found most if not all hotel staff, from the maitre d'hotel to the housekeeping staff really friendly and helpful. As a non-Portuguese speaker myself, the hotel staff often went out of their way to make my stay perfect, and I appreciated how most staff could speak near perfect English. The hotel seemed busy the whole time I was there, you could put this down to the place being quite popular, but I must say that all staff seemed to be going about their duties quite efficiently and with a smile, regardless. I particularly enjoyed the aqua spa which is a good value for money really, and the swimming pool, although small, is not too bad itself, given you can access it quite easily without having to travel too far. There is an exclusive lounge on the top floor too for premier access guests. The hotel is located quite close to at least 2 metro stations and operates a taxi rank outside which offers a variety of travel options into the city centre. The rooms did not seem to be too big nor stately, but expect them to be really clean and furnished to a 5-star standard. I also enjoyed the in-house pianist who plays between Wednesday and Sunday. But most of all, I appreciated the service offered by the hotel staff which for me is a make or break. Thank you Corinthia hotel and keep it up! I will definitely be coming back here whenever I come to Lisbon again."
Sep 2016,30,This property is so so with less than average service,"The hotel is clean and basic--definitely not a five star hotel. The front desk check in process was painfully slow, however the attendants were friendly. Upon arrival, we ordered food on the patio restaurant. An hour an a half later, we didn't have our lunch despite our continual requests. When I complained to management, they said they would handle it, however the lunch, which came out cold was still on our bill. The indoor pool is a little strange. They require you to wear a swim cap which I found to be unusual. The location is a little far from the center of town so we had to cab back and forth. This was fine, except there isn't anyone at the hotel that is helps call a taxi. Overall, this hotel is clean but they definitely need to step up the service."
Sep 2016,40,Borderline 5* but still good,"Stayed for one night with the kids, rooms were small but clean, bathrooms and towels good and the bed was very comfortable.  The pool was a bit dissappointing as it was indoors and the outdoor lounge area felt cramped. We did not eat there but the hotel was good value, close to the zoo and metro system. I have been to Lisbon a few time and will probably look elsewhere."
Sep 2016,20,Not a 5star hotel,"The room is kind of dirty. Don't they vacuum every day? Probably it wasn't vacuumed the night I checked in. Even though I had breakfast included in my reservation,   the hotel didn't give me any information about it when I checked in. I chose this hotel because it was a 5star, but it's only a 3star service. It's close to the station and that's about all the hotel is good for."
Sep 2016,50,Almost perfect!,"Two of us stayed here for three nights from Sept 1st.  From day one when I first made the booking and emailed the hotel with a few questions the level of service was outstanding.  The Guest Services Team; Sandra, Antonio, Ana, Joana, Rafaela & Maira were friendly, knowledgeable, and able to answer all my questions quickly.  When we arrived we were upgraded to a Junior Suite with access to the Executive Lounge which was a real treat.  The service from Monica and Daniel in the Executive Lounge was really wonderful, Daniel seemed to be there 24 hours a day and while keeping in the background he always seemed to appear exactly when needed. The hotel is very close to the Metro station with easy access to the city, I would absolutely stay there again on my next trip to Lisbon.  We had a small issue with the spa which wasn't dealt with very well, but the massages when they did take place were wonderful.  Our stay was pretty close to perfect.  Thank you!"
Sep 2016,50,Fabulous,"This was our second stay at the Corinthia (first was 6 years ago) for a 3 night break and it was fabulous, from the moment we were picked up at the airport to the moment we had to leave to come home.Everything you would expect from a top class hotel, we stayed in an executive room on floor 21 with access to the executive lounge on floor 24, amazing food, atmosphere and staff.  The breakfast in particular was a highlight with everything you could possibly want and more!Everyone was so helpful and friendly throughout the hotel, the Terrace Bar is great to relax with live music on an evening, a great range of cocktails and amazing bar food, especially the mini salmon burgers (not so mini!) and my partner had the mini beef burgers (again not so mini!), very reasonable.The hotel is conviniently situated for the Metro, a 5 minute walk and no more than a 15 minute journey to the main square and beyond, excellent transport links.I cannot recommnd this hotel enough if you want to stay outside the centre but with easy access via public transport and of course plenty of taxi's on tap to take you out and about.We cannot wait to return for another break."
Sep 2016,50,Excellent hotel,"High class hotel, i loved the breakfast :) We had just slightly problem with our hotel card. Sometimes i could not enter the room. And the only thing that i did not like was the deposit of 100€ for the bar, i think that is not necessary since you can afford the stay-. The employees were so nice and professional."
Sep 2016,50,Great stay at Corinthia Hotel,"Enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Corinthia, room on 23rd floor comfortable with views towards the centre, worth upgrading to executive room which gives access to executive lounge on 24th floor, staff very helpful, special mention to Monica who recommended a couple of things to do during our visit and was most helpful during our stay. Hotel is conveniently situated for the underground 5 min walk, then 15  - 20 min journey to centre. Would recommend if staying in Lisbon."
Sep 2016,40,Even better than I had thought !,"I was confused about what was included as it seemed there was an executive part at the top of hotel not available to everyone . I knew there was an indoor pool but wasn't sure about any outside space to enjoy the sun in.But I was delighted to find that the pool which was lovely ( you have to buy swimming hats to wear in the pool ) has a table with chilled water topped up regularly and a great sunbathing deck ! We used the spa once and enjoyed the clean and luxurious facilities of sauna, steam , invigorating pool, jacuzzi and more .We couldn't get a treatment as it was fully booked - so if you want one book in advance ! The room itself is clean and comfortable but not like the picture and somehow lacked something .None of the rooms seem to have a balcony ... And it just felt a little standard though the view was good and the bed comfortable .The hotel facilities , inside and outside bar are lovely .The staff are all polite, helpful and nothing is too much trouble .I decided to pay in advance for the breakfast and I'm glad I did - it was brilliant !All the usual sausage , bacon , rosti potato , delicious creamy scrambled egg and boiled egg, or individually cooked omelette with a choice of ingredients .Also waffles ,pastries, great breads , meats , cheeses, fruits and even sardines ! It's not far into the main part of Lisbon - if you go on the metro be careful not to buy train tickets by mistake( like we did) but head down beyond the train part of the station that has lines marked 1,2,3 etc whilst the metro has coloured lines .Taxis aren't expensive either though .We really enjoyed our stay and would go back !"
Sep 2016,50,Service with a Portugese smile,"Have stayed at other hotels in Lisbon, but since our discovery have returned always to the Corinthia. It is a lot cheaper than the London experience but the staff from chambermaids to guest services are as good.Request a high floor as the views of Lisbon at night are phenomenal. As stated previously the breakfast is great value for a day of exploring also the Tipico restaurant is great value.You can purchase a Lisbon rover ticket at the. Metro Jardim Zoological for seven euros a day, allowing access to metro, buses and trams, a great way to get around. In the area their are quite a few good restaurants.Ideally situated close to the airport  for a quick departure.The hotel is well maintained, and very clean in all common areas, we shall yet again return"
Sep 2016,40,Great Stay - one with one minus,"Fantastic stay. The staff are so nice and helpful. The Service in Top. The hotel has all you need. The Breakfast Buffet amazing. The only minus is that the Wellness department did not have their affairs in order. They rescheduled over and over. Cancelled. Did not have products home, did not have staff available. One masseuse was Great, another not so good. Is was a joke. We ended up only having 1 treatment each, instead of 3 each as planed from home. Also the swimmingpool area was a bit boring compared to the standart of the hotel. It could be more nice, with a jacuzzi for all and another decor. Also do not charge for a swimming cap, when it is a demand to swim there, and people are paying good money to stay at the hotel. So all in all great stay - but do something about your SPA."
Sep 2016,50,5 star service at a 5 Star hotel,"I came and stayed here in a layover and decided to make the best of my stay actually touring the city and enjoying this hotel, I stayed in the upper executive level and I do not regret the decision.The upper levels of the hotel are amazing with a dedicated executive lounge and dinning area that makes the extra money paid for the room worth it.The hotel was ever so accommodating And were even able to arrange for me to book a private Mercedes to tour the city at night for a very reasonable price. When back in Lisbon, I will be staying here again!"
Sep 2016,40,A fabulous stay in Lisbon!,About a minute away from Jardim Zoologico metro which takes you right to the heart of Lisbon. I would opt for the breakfast to be included as it was very good and offered a lot of choice. Very nice clean rooms and we had a good view to the north and to the zoo. They also offered us the late checkout when asked. About 7 - 8 euros by uber to the Santa Apolonia station (we arrived from Porto via train) and about the same to the airport. Free wifi. They provide a complimentary bottle of water every day which I found was a nice touch.
Sep 2016,40,Very nice and clean hotel,"We stayed here for 4 days in Juny. Our room was clean and quiet, beds were comfortable also. The hotel was near metro station and it was easy to get to the centre. The hotel had also nice terrace outside to sit and watch football. I could recommend this hotel."
Sep 2016,50,A true 5-star hotel!,Friendly and helpful staff.Well-organized elevators.A wonderful view of the city from the upper floors.Very Modern and well-designed rooms.Comfortable beds.Constant playing of musics (from music channels) in the bathroom was awsome.Facilitated equipments in the training room.Great indoor swimming pool.2 minutes walking distance from the subway station. 4 stations (about 15 minutes) from the city center.
Sep 2016,40,5 Stars,What a lovely hotel with amazing views. We were so impressed with our stay that we retuned back a month later. What I did notice was how clean every thing was... the common areas were always so tidy and spotless  !!!
Sep 2016,40,"Great hotel with great service, but one thing about the pool ....","The hotel and staff were great. The room was beautiful and the bed one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. It was absolutely huge (we stayed in the deluxe room). The only thing I didn't like was the fact that you had to wear a silly hat in the pool. Not a swimming cap- it didn't keep your hair dry. Just a fabric black hat and you had to pay for it. I don't really remember seeing that anywhere when we booked it. And if it's a must have it should be given to you free. Not like we'll ever use it again. Even a baby had it on which I think is extremely silly. Also to note- you won't have access to anything but the pool and gym unless you book a spa treatment. Only then can you use the steam room, sauna, etc."
Sep 2016,50,"Lovely hotel, comfortable stay","This is a lovely hotel, with very friendly and helpful staff. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which had an amazing view of the beautiful city of Lisbon. We ate dinners at the hotel and it was excellent. It is located a little far from the main attractions, but Uber made it very comfortable and easily accessible, also the train and metro stations are 1 min walk from the hotel, so that was perfect. We took the train to Sintra and it was very comfortable. Sintra is a must visit if you are in Lisbon.Not to forget to mention the bed was one of the most comfortable one I have slept in, in a hotel ever. My only complaints about the hotel is that they need to keep their drinks on the executive floor in a mini fridge or something, because they were never cold. The ice buckets aren't just enough to keep them cold. Beer is warm, and so were all the other soft drinks. Also, the TV in our room was placed in such an awkward position that neither could the 2 of us watch from the sofa straight nor from the bed. Besides, it was a great stay. If I ever return to Lisbon, will definitely stay here again!"
Aug 2016,30,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel but unfortunately not given the room booked. Booked a twin bed room but was given a double bed room twice.Other than that location was good, hotel was clean and new. Can't fault it too much"
Aug 2016,50,Lovely hotel in a beautiful city,"The hotel was wonderful! The staff was very helpful, and made our stay very pleasant. The room was lovely, with a stunning view of the city! The room was even cleaned twice a day. And it was very quiet. The wifi worked perfectly. The excecutive lounge offered great food, and wonderful service from the staff. We absolutely loved it!"
Aug 2016,50,The true 5* experience,"The hotel is wonderful, starting from the excellent decor, continuing with a very attentive client service expetience, ending with the strategic and quiet location. It was my sixth stay at Corinthia and would return any time. The hotel is located neas a metro station that connects all important stations, it is near the Zoo, and you get discounts for the entrance at the zoo. All personel is very professional and committed to make the clients happy, always finding elegant ways to deal with any situations, and I must say I am a picky person :) The decoration of the rooms is elegant and you might be lucky enough to have a view at the imposing aqueduct. Plus, you get a candy every day :)) In Paris a 5* hotel didn't even bother to give us a map,  let alone sweets!"
Aug 2016,50,Good value for very friendly service in good ambiance,They realy do everything to make sure that you enjoy your stay at the hotel. Excellent facilities including executive lounge room. Close to metro so no problem in getting into city center (10 min). Good aircondioneted without noise.
Aug 2016,50,Great Spot for Post-Cruise layover,"Our cruise line (Regent) booked this hotel for us as part of a post-cruise stay in Lisbon.  The hotel is near the American Embassy in Lisbon.  We arrived at the hotel from the ship well in advance of our designated check-in time and rooms were not yet available, but the staff did their best to keep everyone relaxed while we waited.  In the end, we had our room almost two hours earlier than the posted checkin time, which was excellent because we had a tour pre-scheduled and didn't want to have to lug our hand luggage around on a tour. Although we had arranged our tours privately, the hotel Concierge staff was most helpful in connecting us with the  tour guides.  Our most enjoyable experience at this hotel was casually dining in their very nice outdoor patio area at night to the accompaniment of an excellent pianist.  The service was excellent as was the food and wine.  We were quite happy with the size of our room as well as the size of the bathroom.  The room decor was low key and the amenities provided were most appreciated.While the hotel isn't exactly located in the heart of Lisbon, it is very well located for relatively easy airport access which was fine for us."
Aug 2016,50,Still one of the best hotels in Lisbon | Sigue siendo de los mejores hoteles de Lisboa..,"Es un hotel excepcional. Desde las habitaciones, hasta el servicio, mobiliario.. y el mejor buffet de desayuno que he tomado en Lisboa. Esta vez probamos a movernos en metro. Con un billete de 1 día (6 Euros) tienes acceso a todos los transportes de la ciudad, tranvías incluidos. Desde el hotel, a 2 min andando hay una estación que deja en el elevador de Santa justa en pocos minutos. Muy muy recomendable. | Really outstanding hotel. Quality of sleep, services, furniture, etc. It's great. Also.. the best breakfast buffet I had in a hotel. Location... this time we tried to move around by metro. You can purchase a 1 day ticket that includes all transports in 24h (trams, subway, etc). From hotel, 2 mins away walking, you can find the metro that connects you to Santa Justa elevator in minutes. It's worth it.Lo peor...La piscina creo que está descontrolada. No vigilan lo que la gente hace (o no debería hacer). Es una piscina no muy grande. No da pié a tirarse de cabeza y demás. Eso debería controlarse, así como el acceso de la gente (sin calzado de piscina y gorro obligatorio). | I think the pool needs to be controlled carefully . They do not check what people do (or should not) . Since It is a not very large pool, it doesn't have sense to jump, etc. That should be controlled, as well as access of people ( without shoes pool and mandatory cap) ."
Aug 2016,50,short break,most enjoyable stay at hotel. Very close to metro. Added bonus of sunterrace and pool after a long day sight seeing.Would recommend upgrading for use of executive lounge.would stay here again on any future trips to Lisbon
Aug 2016,50,Portugal paradise,Words cannot describe the services and hospitality at this hotel. World class. I will certainly return to this hotel only. The people are friendly and will go out of their way to cater to your every need.
Aug 2016,50,hotel excellent,"We enjoyed our stay and will return if we are in Lisbon again.  The staff was outstanding.  We had breakfast, dinner and drinks at the hotel, all of which we enjoyed.  We will recommend this hotel to friends."
Aug 2016,50,Brilliant Hotel & Staff,"The hotel has brilliant staff and is in a convenient location. All staff spoke english and were helpful. I had a small birthday cake request  for my partner which was met with a bottle of champagne, a on-demand cake and a personalised message! Would recommend to anybody staying in Lisbon."
Aug 2016,40,Good hotel but some slow service,The hotel was fine with most aspects being very good. Service at  meals was inconsistent however. For example at breakfast we had to ask three times for coffee and then be quite firm with a senior member of staff who told me that one of the staff would bring the coffee despite my having asked three members of the already.
Aug 2016,40,Enjoyable Stay,Wonderful staff and facilities. Only comments regard availability of ice and confusion about lighting - sometimes lamps work and sometimes they don't. I couldn't figure that out. Soft drink bottles very difficult to open with the openers provided in the bar. Suggestion: get better bottle openers.
Aug 2016,40,"Nice hotel, bad location","This hotel is nice enough but if you wish to be in the heart of the city, go elsewhere.  The room is clean.  Was there with my husband.  Ended up with twin beds.  Thank God it was only for one night, then on to a cruise."
Aug 2016,50,Stay at the Corinthia Lisbon Summer 2016,"A truly beautiful hotel, excellent location although a little further out of the city centre its right on the tour bus and underground route.A must if you are visiting Lisbon!Its a vibrant colourful and youthful city, all round an excellent stay."
Aug 2016,30,Worst hair dryer ever,"Location too far from the city center.  Staff is excellent.  Restaurant Tipico better than expected.  Would have received a higher rating if the hair dryer had t been the worst I ever experienced.  It could not be used in the bathroom, had low power and you had to keep your finger constantly on the power button or it wouldn't operate.  Extremely annoying."
Aug 2016,50,"""World Class""","The Hotel Corinthia proved to be a ""World Class"" hotel in every way . The hotel is a 10 minute drive from the airport and a short drive to the city center. We opted for the metro, located right across the street, 6 or 7 stops and you are in the center of town. The metro ticket system is easy to operate, english option, and is safe and clean. Parking is available under the hotel for 18 euros a night. The staff were true professionals who would go out of there way to ensure all of your needs were met. The whole hotel was spotless and the rooms have every amenity you could possibly need; plus great wifi throughout the whole building. Indoor pool, bring a swim cap, or buy one for 2.5 euros, fitness center and spa. Lisbon must be the Hotel capital of the world if there are 40 hotels ranked higher then this one."
Aug 2016,40,Very impressive with staff,"Stayed here two nights before leaving on a cruise.  Many other Americans were at this hotel before going on same Regent cruise.  We dragged in Tuesday morning after an all night flight and our Executive Queen Nonsmoking room wasn't ready.  The lady at the executive checkin deck asked us if we would consider a smoking room and offered to show us four choices.  The second one we saw was just fine - no odor - nice room 2016 with beautiful view.  For a reasonable cost we had full access to the Executive Club Floor.  We loved that room.  They served a wonderful breakfast with made-to-order eggs and omelets, soup, bread, cheeses, desserts etc for lunch and appetizers for dinner.  Beverages were available all day until 10 pm, including wine and beer (no hard liquor).  The staff could not have been nicer.  Our room was fine except the hair dryer doesn't work in the bathroom.  The bathroom was spacious and included washcloths (not always found in Europe).  The location was very quiet - away from downtown - but near the subway.  Taxis in Lisbon are quite reasonable.  Taxi from the airport should only cost 15 euros but we were charged 20.  Taxi to the cruise ship was only 13 euros.Again I want to say how nice the staff was at this hotel."
Aug 2016,50,Fantastic hotel :),"Stayed in the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon and have to say it was brilliant. Staff were so friendly and always helpful.. We emailed them prior to our arrival and the amount of information they provided to get there made our trip so easy. We celebrated our 1st Wedding Anniversary while there, was upgraded to a junior suite & given access to the executive lounge. We had champagne and cake in our room on arrival. Such a lovely, lovely surprise. Rooms were cleaned daily.Metro station about a 3 min walk from hotel and so handy for getting around! Beautiful hotel and a massive thanks to all the staff for making our stay and 1st Anniversary an extra special one. We will be back :) Bernie & Chris Ireland!"
Aug 2016,50,Corinthia Lisbon delivers!,"From the moment you are met at the door of the hotel, the welcoming staff, the cleanliness of your room, I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. With 100% occupancy you did not realise and quality of service did not slip. We will definitely come back."
Aug 2016,50,Five star service +++++,"We stayed here 3+5 nights on our Portugal holiday, us parents and our 10-month-old baby. We were upgraded both times, first to a junior suite and to on the second stay to an executive suite. Both rooms were really nice and spacious. Common areas are nice as well. Staff was really friendly and nice on both stays. Extra thanks goes to the housekeeping lady on 21st floor - she is absolutely charming! Taxis are cheap and also the metro goes nearby so no need to accommodate to the centrum. Five star hotel!"
Aug 2016,50,Fantastic stay in Lisbon,The hotel was wonderful and we got to enjoy an executive junior suite which was very comfortable and with a wonderful view. The staff and especially the ones attached to the executive lounge were incredibly attentive and made our stay even better. We will definitely be back.
Aug 2016,40,very nice hotel close to center,"The hotel was very nice , stuff friendly and breakfast good as usual.  The hotel located a bit off the center , and you need to take taxi ( that is not so expensive in Lisbon ) or use underground .  The only issue was an elevator that is always busy ( there are just four elevators for very big hotel it's not enough) ."
Aug 2016,50,Absolutely Fantastic,"Stayed here for 5 nights in July, booked junior suite and it was amazing.  One of the best hotels we have ever stayed in.  Champagne, strawberries and traditional custard pastries were in the room on our arrival as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.  The room, decor and amenities were excellent.  Staff were so helpful and obliging.  Breakfast was really good, had room service which was excellent and ate in the restaurant one evening which was excellent.  Thumbs up all round.  Thank you so much everyone at the Corinthia for making our stay so special and memorable."
Aug 2016,40,Favourite hotel lovely!!,Fantastic staff great roomsLovely terraceGreat for couples or singlesDownside no facilities to shower on late check out be warned!!This is one of the top hotels in Lisbon in my opinion They will go Out of their way to ensure you are looked afterMuito Obrigada Corinthia
Aug 2016,50,Corinthia Hotel,Spacious and stylish 5 Star that easily absorbs the number of guess and lets you feel that this is all about you. After a heavy day's sightseeing a cocktail in the outdoor bar listening to a virtuoso live pianist is the perfect end to a sunny day.
Aug 2016,20,Poor Hotel,"I have to agree with some of the more negative comments on Tripadvisor regarding this hotel. No one single point makes me negative, just the whole feel of the hotel was wrong . I definitely would not rate this a 5 star hotel and the price should have been a giveaway (£150 in high season). A few justifications for my comment : Chaotic check-in and check it, robotic staff, absolutely no soul/character to the hotel. Our 'Non-smoking' room smelt suspicious of cigarette smoke, which my kids really did not enjoy. Located in an 'interesting ' district under flight path of airport. €10 cab ride into town centreSeems like there are many other nicer options for similar price but centrally located.Treat as an 'airport hotel' I will never stay there again ."
Aug 2016,50,Great Hotel and Superb Staff,"Fantastic hotel, great for both business and leisure.Staff are welcoming, attentive and most helpful at all times.Definitely would stay here again. Good location to get into and out of the city, metro right across the street, taxis readily available."
Aug 2016,50,Wonderful stay,"The staff upon check in were extremely helpful and assisted my partner and I in getting into Lisbon and back. The room was clean and spacious including a fridge, hair dryer and air conditioning. Although the location was not in the center of Lisbon, the Corinthia is located close to both a bus stop to town, to the airport and a train station - ensuring easy transportation. The staff were extremely helpful, in particular Rafaella - who assisted my partner and I in exploring Sintra, Cascais and returning to Lisbon in a day. We thank Rafaella and the rest of the Corinthia staff and hope to return sometime soon!"
Aug 2016,50,Worthy and Well Run,The Corinthia is a fine hotel with a well trained staff. We arrived painfully early and the staff was able to direct us to breakfast and nearby attractions.  Our large and well appointed room was ready early. We were on one of the executive floors and had access to a lounge and breakfast floor on the top floor. Modern decor with good local art. The hotel is very close to the Lisbon efficient subway system.
Aug 2016,50,Lovely stay,"This is my second trip to Lisbon and second stay at the Corinthia. The staff couldn't be more pleasant. Rooms are comfortable and the executive lounge is very pleasant. The hotel is very close to the metro, making it convenient to get around the city."
Aug 2016,50,Above and Beyond,We stayed here for my wife's fortieth and they upgraded us to a suite which had a bottle of champagne and later a chocolate birthday cake. And the hotel was amazing. Great breakfast and very nice decor.
Aug 2016,50,Very friendly hotel with great outdoor space,"Lovely hotel with very friendly staff that can't do enough to help you. The hotel is just across the road from the Jardim Zoologico metro and Sete Rios train station with easy access to all of Lisbons main attractions. In our opinion the metro was easiest way to get around. We got a Lisboa card at the airport and you use can use this on the train, metro, trams and buses. One of the biggest selling points of this hotel is the outside space, that is a big bonus for a city hotel. They have a lovely terrace area where you can eat and drink and in the mornings we also ate our breakfast outside which was much more calming and relaxing than sitting inside in the restaurant. The pool was very busy and being August full of kids, the spa's adult only relaxation area was well worth the extra 20 Euros and a lovely way to cool off after a day out sight seeing in the heat. I definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Lisbon."
Aug 2016,30,5*...?,I have booked this hotel on the Booking.com website and selected the Family room. Upon arrival we were offered a normal superior room with an additional small bed for my son. Breakfast was not included but could be added for 20€ pp/day! Children pay 10€ additional charge...
Aug 2016,40,"Good service, clean rooms","Enjoyed three nights there.  There was 5 of us sharing two rooms.  Easy access to all key areas of the city.  Check in was easy, friendly staff.  Good room service.  Enjoyed our stay there.  Lots of taxi cabs at the taxi stand.  Enjoyed restaurant and food."
Aug 2016,50,Excellent,"Excellent, and looking forward to going their next year, the children loves it and can't wait for another holiday their, Excellent staffs and they all speaks English. nice pool, clean rooms and very nice location."
Aug 2016,50,it was a very memorable experience,"I think this is one of the best hotels I have ever been.  Very friendly, lovely staff, very clean, delicious food, I will stay again and will recommend to my family and friends.  I most likely come back next year."
Aug 2016,40,Comfortable hotel,"My stay at the Corinthia was quite a mixed experience.Door men were friendly but check in was a lengthy and painful process. It is a large and busy hotel and when I arrived there was a substantial queue at check in. There were four members of staff but three were helping out on one problematic booking, this left one other person to keep a huge queue moving along.I was early to check in but the staff member informed me they would have a room ready in an hour.  That was fine so I decided to wait in the hotel, when I re-queued an hour later, that staff member had gone and another told me it would be another hour and 30 minutes until check in at 2pm. I would not have waited around if I had known that to be the case.Service was generally massively inconsistent, sometimes wonderful and other times massively short of what you would expect in a 5 star hotel.The food I ate in both restaurants was good. The pool and gym were good and staff were friendly.It is located within minutes of the metro station which takes you to the city centre and also not far from the airport - cost 8 euros to the airport in an Uber.Room was comfortable but nothing ""wow"".Overall, my stay here was good but they really need to streamline service and also add more people to reception to make check in and check out quicker. It's not a hotel that wows you but rather more so like a good 4 star hotel."
Aug 2016,50,great hotel,"fantastic hotel, staff very helpful, large clean rooms, great beds nice and large crisp white clean bed linen  we all had a  very relaxing sleep great hotel for family holiday swimming pool was great, great security at hotel, also spa was great was treated to a relaxing massage felt like a new woman...... the hotel is a little bit further out from the main attractions but 5 euro taxi ride sorts that out, it felt alot safer with kids as only peolpe staying in the hotel were using it......would stay there again"
Aug 2016,50,Excellent option for city visit,"The hotel is a little way out of town but it is only 5-10 minutes to the metro and then 5 stops into the centre. The hotel is modern and is all you would expect from a hotel of this standard; spotlessly clean, tidy, attentive staff, air-conditioned. The rooms are large enough and those on upper floors have good views across the city. Air-conditioning works well but best was the ability to open a window even 21 floors up.Staff in the executive lounge were generally helpful and the light snacks were kept available throughout the day which enabled us to pop back during the hottest part of the day to somewhere relaxing with refreshments. Daniel, who served coffee at breakfast and was present in the late evening always addressed us by name and was happy to make us feel at home.A buffet breakfast is served in the Executive Lounge and it has plenty of choice.The pool was OK but the aqua-area of the spa seemed a little expensive given that we have had free access to such in other hotels in the group.  We arrived very late in the evening and I was surprised that I was not offered concierge service for the cases to the room, not that this is a problem for me. A coffee station with cereals and pastries is also available from 5 a.m. for early departing guests (which we were). Fortunately, having found out we were leaving early, Daniel advised us about this, the only one who did.In comparison to the cost of some of the traditional 5 star hotels in the centre of the city, this was good value as long as you are happy to travel on the metro and the services in the executive lounge certainly outweighed the disadvantages of location.Interestingly, whilst we normally book travel elements direct, this time we booked via BA and got a better overall deal."
Aug 2016,30,Poor service by day. ,"I stayed here mid week and was alone. I arrived ltd evening and enjoyed a drink on the terrace. My server, Beatriz, was excellent. She offered her insights on the wines and had an amazing character. I hoped the rest of my stay would follow this pattern. My room on the 19th floor was well appointed and the bed was very comfortable. The plug situation left a lot to be desired. I had to either charge my device by the main door on the floor or unscrew bulbs from lamps to then be able to charge any device closer to the bed. Quite the phaff. The following day I wanted lunch and waited 35 mins to be served. I ended up leaving and going to a quaint bar 3 doors down. I also tried to pay my bill early to help expedite my departure but after waiting 25 mins I was met with apathy and very poor service and I wasted my valuable time. Over all a very mixed experience."
Aug 2016,30,Summer Stay,"I visited the Corinthia from the 3-10th August with my friend and God daughter. Prior to my arrival I emailed the hotel and informed them of this to ensure that we did not get a double bed as we are 2 women and asked for single beds as well as a bed for a child and a quiet room. They emailed and said that they would try to accommodate this request. The email was prompt and courteous. On arrival we were greeted by the grandness that is the hotel. The footmen were polite and took our luggage and we went to check in. At check in I was told that yes they had given us a quiet room on a high floor but this had a double bed. Even though I had specifically asked prior to arrival that this not be the case. Instead of this we had to settle for a room on the 4th floor to ensure we got single beds. The hotel will also take a copy of your passport and secure your credit card for incidentals. None of which I was happy about. The hotel lobby is grand and they have obviously spent a lot of money in doing it up. The lifts were a bit confusing at first as you have to place your room key card under the buttons then press the floor you want to go to and then it will tell you which lift will open either ABCD and it takes some getting used to. Upon entering our room I was slightly disappointed. It was okay but the decor is very old. The bathroom was nice and had complimentary toiletries however there was no walk in shower just a bath with a shower head. The room was so tiny and when asked for the single bed we then realised that to have it in the room with 3 people would be a tight squeeze. So I rang reception to complain and they were able to upgrade our room however had they just of followed my request in the first place they would not have had to of done it. They also made it feel as though they were doing me a favour!! It took over an hour for someone to get back to me and by this time we were exhausted and just wanted to chill out after such a long flight but we knew we couldn't because we would be moving rooms.We then moved to the 11th floor. The room was a lot more bigger but also had a lot more outdated furniture. The beds were very comfortable and we were able to place the single bed in the room my god daughter. One of the things I did notice was the smell of the pillow cases and towels. Now yes they were clean but they had a frousy smell to them each day. So every night I had to take off the pillow cases and spray the pillows with body mist to try and take out the smell. At one point I asked for new pillows and they smelt exactly the same it is then I realised that it must be the soap powder or something that they use to clean the bed linen with, however it smelt disgusting and I spent most of my stay sleeping on my travel pillow. The cleaners never once did a good job cleaning the room. The lamps and tables were filthy and covered in dust always. My friend had some green soap which she had been using and left it on the side. Because it was wet it left a green mark. Now supposedly the cleaners had cleaned our room but the stain was still there and the bath was still dirty. They never took our rubbish out even though we left it in the centre of the room to clearly show that it was rubbish. All they seemed to do was make the bed and replenish the towels. Some days you would get complimentary chocolate and other days you wouldn't. You would also get free bottled water but not always. The cleaners never took notice of the do not disturb sign either. One morning we went to breakfast and left all of our belongings on show and our suitcases opened knowing we would be away for half an hour tops we came back our beds had been made even though we had the sign up. We were absolutely fuming!!!! When we did leave the sign up asking for our room to be cleaned it wasn't and took them forever to do. It was so frustrating. There is a small flat screen TV in the hotel however ever single channel is in Portuguese!!!!!The only channels in English are the news channels. Which is ridiculous. You go to any hotel in any country in the world and there would be both English and non English speaking channels. We decided to buy a HDMI cable to hook up to our tablets. Well that was a waste of time as the hotel have blocked the use of the cables so we couldn't even do that. We didn't turn the TV on again after day 2. Such a disappointment. There are SO many children that come to the hotel with their families and it's sad to say that the hotel does not cater for them at all. There is only one swimming pool and that's about it. There is no crèche or children's facilities or children's club or children's area or entertainer.There is nothing to keep the children amused whilst being at the hotel and that is a shame and the Corinthia should think long and hard about rectifying that. One of the nicest things about the hotel is their food. We stayed bed and breakfast and I'm glad we did. Breakfast is really amazing. It has everything. From hot waffles to pancakes to cereals to fruit to cakes and pastries to bread and rolls and to hot food like eggs, omelettes, bacon, sausages etc. There's a variety of different juices and teas and water and hot chocolate. You can go up as much as you want and eat as much as you like. Different cheeses and jams and butter and meats it's absolutely brilliant and one of the highlights of my stay. One thing that did annoy me was you were not allowed to take food out of the dining room......what a silly rule! Another brilliant thing about the hotel is the spa. It is only €20 euros for 2 hours to use their spa facility if you are a guest there. It is amazing. The pool the jacuzzi the sauna and Turkish bath, absolute bliss and would definitely recommend. There is also a gym and swimming pool which again are brilliant additions to the hotel and would recommend. I ate at the hotel a few times and the food is so good however very pricey. It is like €5  for a can of Sprite which is extortionate however the food is very nice as well as the cocktails so I guess you get what you pay for. The hotel staff are so kind and friendly and really go out of their way to help. The doormen are just brilliant and were always on hand whenever we needed to hail a cab or speak to the driver in Portuguese to tell them where we needed to go. Overall would I stay at the Corinthia again? My answer would be no. The food and staff, spa, swimming pool and leisure facilities make this hotel what it is. It is close to the airport which is brilliant, probably a 15 minute drive maximum but overall the rooms are worn and dated and lacks attention to detail. It needs a image overhaul. The TV situation needs to be addressed and the cleaners all need a lesson in cleaning. The hotel have spent a lot of money on the lobby and dining rooms as well as the spa and leisure facilities but have forgotten about the rest of the hotel. I did not go to the sky bar so I am not sure about how that is but no doubt is probably a nice area within the hotel. This isn't a family friendly hotel and children will suffer as a result of this as there is nothing to do and not being able to access English speaking TV channels may cause a bit of an issue especially if you have not brought anything to keep your child occupied. It was an adequate stay in a semi decent hotel however I have been to better. Too many things and the lack of attention to detail made this place sadly a hotel I would not return to and its a shame as it has the potential to be great."
Aug 2016,40,Lisbon 6 day leisure trip,Very nice hotel but you need to use the metro to get around but that said the metro has an excellent service so easy to use and get around If you like walk you can walk in to city centre through the park and along the streets about 5 K just remember it's all down hill so walking back to hotel is all up hill make sure you visit the time out market both day and night it is at the end of the green line out the door and its facing you A MUST see city enjoy
Aug 2016,50,Lovely hotel in Lisbon,"Located about midway between airport and CBD - easy access to central Lisbon via metro which is easy to navigate, cheap using 6€ day pass. Staff cheerful and helpful; rooms comfortable and spacious. Good restaurants close by- great breakfasts to be had at nearby patisserie for less than 10€ per couple for coffee and pastries."
Aug 2016,50,nice stay at Corinthia,"Nice and claen hotel. Nice and verry kindlley staff . Willing to do the best for theire customers.We enjoyed the breakfast: nice various choise of food.Room was clean , but pitty it was not form the beginning in good orde for the made reservation.."
Aug 2016,40,Comfortable stay,"We had a comfortable stay for eight nights. Nice rooms, knowledgeable staff and good cleaning. The rooms had a shortage of power outlets in convenient locations and the room service took long even thou it must be said the pizza was ordered at a late hour."
Aug 2016,50,Exceptional Service,"This is a beautiful hotel in a convenient location. The staff are 5-star. The Sete Rios train station and Jardim Zoologico metro station is literary across the street from the hotel. The train and metro stations are in the same building. We were at the 22nd floor and the view is amazing. The pool is also very nice, but you are required to wear a swim cap. If you don't have one, they will sell you one for $2.50 Euro. There is a sun desk where you can sun bath. We did try the buffet dinner at the hotel. The food was good, but not great. There are several restaurants nearby offered better food.I wish I have more time to enjoy this hotel and will stay here again."
Aug 2016,50,Excellent hotel with amazing staff,"First time to Lisbon, this hotel was excellent. The hospitality and service is great. We had a veruit good time staying here. Also the location is just perfect. Zoo, shopping mall at walking distance and metro/train station around the corner."
Aug 2016,40,Luxurious Hotel,"The breakfast was amazing with a variety of things to eat and drink, the rooms were big and comfortable and there is also a swimming pool that is for free. However, the room was not as clean as it should for a 5star hotel and we had some problems with the cleaning service which were immediately solved by the reception. Unfortunately the hotel is not near the old city center so you may use either the subway which is relatively close by or take a taxi."
Aug 2016,30,"Great pool, but 4 star hotel","Nice hotel, great pool, great outdoor lounge with music and good location. Definitely not a 5 star experience though. It's the little things that are missing. No alarm clocks in the rooms!, Chairs are used/dirty, bathroom are average. Staff is nice, but don't try to anticipate your needs. Food is mostly overpriced for what it is. Overall we had a good time, kids really enjoyed the pool."
Aug 2016,50,Consistent good service,This was our third stay at the Corinthia and it did not disappoint - staff consistently attentive and wanting to please.  Rooms comfortable - very quiet and best sleep in Portugal.  Nice to have a place with a pool and a gym.  We enjoyed executive lounge.  Metro conveniently nearby.  My only downside was that there is very limited English channels available on the TV.
Aug 2016,50,Above and beyond,"This hotel was wonderful! We were traveling with kids, which anyone with kids knows can be stressful but the staff made it much easier. They provided me with a bottle warmer for our baby and had little chocolates for my toddler just to name a few of the ways they made our stay more enjoyable. Every need I had during our stay was met perfectly. The executive lounge and the room service were perfect as well! No complaints and can't wait to go back!"
Aug 2016,50,Beautiful Hotel in an amazing city!,"The staff was wonderful. They were attentive to all of our needs. The food and wine were excellent. It was simply a beautiful hotel with wonderful amenities in a fantastic city. The Corinthia is close to public transportation, but we had transportation included in our package so we did not use it or the hotels transportation options. When we return to Lisbon, we will definitely stay here again."
Aug 2016,40,Corinthia Lisbon,We stayed at Corinthia Lisbon this summer and had a great time at this hotel. The location is not in the center but close to the metro and the hop on hop off bus stop. Room was great! Perfect place for families. I'm definitely coming back!
Aug 2016,50,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed in this hotel for 6 nights. Upon our request They provided us with a cot for our 6 years old with no additional cost . The  hotel is very clean and newly renovated. You can't beat the location , 5 minutes walk takes you to the metro station on the blue line which is close to everything from shopping to downtown and even airport. There are couple of very good restaurants around it and u can have a very nice breakfast for a reasonable price. The hotel itself serves breakfast in the morning which is 19 euro and half price for kids. I found it to be a bit pricy for kids as they don't eat much.They have a fantastic spa and a very clean pool. We used it twice and loved it.Overall our experience in this hotel was fantastic. I do hope that they keep the same level of fantastic customer service . We had a great time and will go back again if we are back in Lisbon in future!"
Aug 2016,50,5 Star Luxurious Delight,"I stayed in hotel Corinthia Lisbon with my wife and 16 year old son for 5 nights from 4th-9th August 2016. We stayed in a junior suite and breakfast was included in the price. From the moment we checked in to the time of departure it was a wonderful experience. The check in staff were very efficient and very friendly. Guest relations staff were always on hand to help with enquiries on transport and sightseeing in this wonderful city, and again were very helpful. Nearest Metro station is only 200 metres away and city centre is only 10 minutes away. The metro is very easy to travel on. Our room was magnificent with stunning views from the the 19th floor. The room was very spacious. Complimentary litre of water every day and the breakfast was excellent and catered for everybody's needs. The hotel itself is located in the business district of Lisbon which is a very quiet area and with only a few restaurants nearby so it is advisable to head into city centre for a fine range of restaurants and bars. Two points of note. We were charged €20 for taxi from airport to hotel and the return journey to the airport was only €9.80 so we were ripped off by the taxi in the airport. Secondly most of the junior suite rooms have a door to an adjoining room. Overall a beautiful hotel with efficient staff, a great experience and we will be returning in the future."
Aug 2016,50,Great stay in Lisbon,"We stayed a total of four night at the hotel, in one of the Junior Suites which also gives access to the 24th floor Executive Lounge. The hotel is fantastic, the staff extremely nice and helpful, especially Daniel on the 24th floor who after two weeks was able to remember and anticipate my breakfast habits: a true professional! The room was spacious with a stunning view over the city, especially by night. I loved the rich breakfast - the 24th floor lounge also offer the best view over the city and a chef was in the breakfast room to cook just in front of us some omelettes - I love details as such. Room amenities are also excellent, as the hotel uses Espa. It is so easy to reach the property from airport and from Baixa or Alfama. I would definitely like to go back and would recommend the place to friends."
Aug 2016,50,Nice Hotel,"Very nice hotel close to Metro, bus station, staff quite good, rooms spacious, variety of cold and hot breakfast, would highly recommend the hotel when visiting Lisbon, also do not miss the open hop on hop off bus."
Aug 2016,50,What a wonderful hotel,"We stayed at the Corinthia on Sep 2015. Although our stay in this hotel was not recently, we decided to enter a review for this hotel as we enjoyed very much during our stay and the hotel deserves a good positive reviewWe visited Lisbon for full week city break and stayed in the Corinthia Hotel which provided excellent accommodation and food.This hotel is 5 star high class hotelThe room, a junior suite was fantastic, with an excellent view. We enjoyed the access to the executive lounge which was included in our reservation.It is a large nice hotel not far from the city center with very comfortable transportation to the city center. There are train and metro stations nearby which will take you to down town Lisbon or any part of the country.The room was spacious with comfortable King size bed and pillows. The Breakfast buffet was excellent. We could choose to have the breakfast either in the breakfast restaurant or at the lounge club. Both were excellent. The Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, from the moment we checked in the hotel with the nice welcome by the lady (which we forgot her name) in the executive front desk reception throughout the staff at the executive lounge club and all other service providers and especially to Sandra Abrantes the Guest service manager that we had the privilege to meet her personally in which she did all her best to make our stay at the hotel and at Lisbon most enjoyable.I would strongly recommend this Hotel for anyone planning a city break in Lisbon.We will definitely choose this hotel only for our next stays in Lisbon."
Aug 2016,50,Lovely Lisbon,"A return visit, this time with the children. Superb hotel, fabulous breakfast and great comfort. Highly recommend this as a destination in Lisbon and the metro is just around the corner so travelling into the city is easy too"
Aug 2016,50,great stay in magical city,"Good value for the price.  Excellent service throughout the stay, and especially in the lounge. Great metro/train access made navigating Lisbon easy and quick.  Good restaurant areas for locals, not tourists, are nearby and easily accessible.  Negatives:  caps mandatory in pool - we didn't use it.  Buffet restaurant for evenings not great and overpriced."
Aug 2016,50,Relax out of the city center,"Quite, Silent, with very large rooms, huge huge huge breakfast choice, very close to the underground that leads you in the city center in 5 minutes.Staff is very gentle, smiley and helpful.Suggestion: choose the high floor rooms looking to the old bridge. They got a stunning view in the morning and in the afternoon.If you want to stay in the movida, it's definetely not the right option."
Aug 2016,40,Four day visit,"Location was excellent. Sete Rios Metro and train station were very close. Room was confortable, quiet and clean. Use of swimming pool was free but swimming caps ( sold by reception) was mandatory. Unfortunately breakfast was not included to out stay, however numberless piccolos and other servers were empoleyd to stand in the lobby. I would rather include the breakfast to room price, not these servers. Overall this hotel can be recommented for Lisbon visits."
Aug 2016,50,Corinthia Hotel city break ,"The Hotel was very elegant , I stayed in the Junior suite and was given access to the top floor complimentary suite  which  had fab views and chilled wine / beer and nibbles , coffee , desserts which was a bonus . My bedroom was lovely ,so was breakfast which we ate outside in the sunshine ."
Aug 2016,50,Great hotel near metro,"We stayed here at the end of April, early May.  This hotel is beautiful.  Our room was lovely and the bed was very comfortable.  It is close to the metro/train which makes getting around Lisbon so much easier.  We drive in from Spain and the hotel is situated not far from the interstate which we also liked.  We will look for other Corinthia hotels in other cities when we visit.  We loved Lisbon and plan to come each year we are living in Spain."
Aug 2016,40,Splendid!,We really enjoined our stay at Corinthia Hotel. Maybe it was a little too luxury for our family with children and two small grandchildren but everyone was very friendly and understanding. The small children really liked the pool.
Jul 2016,50,"BY JACKLINE JUL 31,2016 ,LOVELY AND FANTASTIC","Thank you so much for making our stay comfortable , we loved the hotel we loved the customer service, the room we got was fantastic with excellent view . We were two adults and two kids we appreciated that you took into consideration by providing us with specious rooms enough space for the kids to run, so well maintained SO SO clean. Kids channel, games to play on TV Awesome.Room air condition and everything was so good. The prices also for a 5star hotel was very nice."
Jul 2016,40,Beautiful!,"My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon. This is a very nice hotel. The lobby was very welcoming and lite. Beautiful decor. I only have one compliant, housekeeping needs to pay more attention to details. The tiles in the bathroom shower were not clean. I could see dirt build-up and the carpet in the room needs a bit of updated. That is the only reason i did not give 5 stars. Everything else was great and my husband and I will stay here again."
Jul 2016,50,A Great Fit,"It took a day to figure out where we were in Lisbon, and what great options were close by.  When we did figure it all out we settled in for a terrific stay and enjoyed different restaurants , sites and activities while in Lisbon."
Jul 2016,40,Great family hotel - made our trip,Fantastic Hotel and location (a short cab ride away from everywhere). Breakfast buffet was amazing. The kids (3 and 6 yr old) enjoyed the personalised service and stunning pool. I had read negative reviews on staff attitude etc on trip advisor but experienced none of it. We will come back to Lisbon and we shall stay at the Corinthia.
Jul 2016,50,Beautiful and classy all around,This was my first time visiting Lisbon and I was blown away by this hotel. It was very clean and modern. The staff was extremely friendly and answered all of my questions. The hotel was also less than 10 min away from the airport which was wonderful. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for luxury and cleanliness while traveling.
Jul 2016,40,"Nice, comfortable, & well located","We  stayed  in a room with access to the executive lounge.  The room & lounge are comfortable and well appointed.   The room is large but the bathroom is small.   Towels & bed linen are good.  Housekeeping was good.Breakfast,  snacks,  cocktails & beverages are available in the lounge.   You can choose to have  breakfast in the restaurant but there isn't  much  more in the restaurant  & it's  quieter in the lounge.  Beer, wine, & champagne  are offered  beginning at 12pm.  There were some staff at the lounge  who weren't  friendly or helpful.  I couldn't understand  why one employee  couldn't bring  something that was offered in the restaurant breakfast buffet up to lounge breakfast.   Daniel was the best so helpful & professional. There is a clean, fast, & inexpensive laundry  service on the street  behind the hotel.  Less than 5 minutes  walk.  No need to have hotel do your  laundry.   We spent  €6.00 to wash a big load.  This hotel  is located close to the train/metro & self service laundry."
Jul 2016,50,Sad to leave !,"We had an excellent stay at the Corinthia Lisbon.Lovely decor, bright and spacious. Although the hotel seemed to be full, it didn't feel over- busy.Staff have obviously received training in customer care -always attentive yet unobtrusive. Bed extremely comfortable with wonderful cotton bedlinen. Breakfast buffet with wide choice of food and efficent table service.We enjoyed many relaxing moments in the Executive lounge on Floor 24-with large panoramic windows, the views of Lisbon are simply sensational and as the weather was very hot during our stay, it was wonderful to get back to the hotel and spend a while having a cool drink and enjoying the views from the Executive Lounge. Perhaps I would just mention that, if travelling with a child/children or additional adult, an executive twin room is not a good idea as there's very little space for an extra bed. On seeing this, we decided to  request an upgrade and had to pay the rate difference.Overall,a very enjoyable stay- my 18 yr old son was very sad to leave the hotel!"
Jul 2016,40,Excellent location ,"The hotel itself is 5star and the staff are very helpful too. The room was a bit small for 3 people, we where expecting 3 single beds, but ended up with two singles and the third bed pulled out from the bottom of the second single. The receptionist had to ask how many people the room was booked for, considering it was booked beforehand via easyjet, they should have known how many beds were required. The last bed was made up when we arrived. We didn't have breakfast included as it was 18euros each,  where as if you go to the cafe over the road you can get food for 3 people for 23 euros. The location of the hotel is very good, slightly a little out of the city. But the metro is literally a 1 minute across the street and it's 15 minutes of less to get into the city, 3euros return ticket. The hotel overall has a very 5star feel to it and is nice. Staff were really nice and helpful."
Jul 2016,50,Relaxation at its best!,"Just back from 11 nights of bliss at the Corinthian in Lisbon.  From the first moment to the time we left, this hotel lived up to our expectations based on TA reviews and more.  We were upgraded (possibly because of the length of our stay).  We had booked a Junior Suite and got an Executive suite.  Wow!  Lovely living area with a super king bed - sleep quality excellent.  I loved having the Nespresso machine in the room but its location was not designed for use.  It was in a press and had to be delicately balanced to insert the capsules.... Milk provided was also scarce.  (Tip, bring up a small jug of milk from breakfast)Speaking of breakfast, it was divine.  Super selection - our first morning was at a busy time (around 9.30) and it was a bit chaotic.  The replenishing of the plates was way too slow.There is enough staff for one person to be in charge of each section and ensuring that it's kept filled.  On most mornings we had breakfast outside on the terrace which was wonderful but there were 6 waiters there which was way more than was necessary.  Again, the staff didn't have specific duties and were a little unsure about what should be done..... One to clear, one to reset, one to pour coffees...... not that complicated.All the service desk staff were super and their command of the English language was excellent - well done.Well done also to the guy at the entrance to the restaurant who called us by name after the first morning - we were almost his best friend by the time we left.Location was super.  Literally across the road from the Metro station of Jardim Zoologico and mainline station of Seite Rios.  €1.40 to city centre - you can easily get to anyplace you wish in Lisbon.  €6 for day ticket and you can use this for as many journeys for 24 hours as you wish.  Great value.  The zoo is literally 5 minutes walk from the hotel.  No issues..... everything works, no hassle anyplace.I'd highly recommend this hotel.  Fabulous quiet area."
Jul 2016,40,"I can not give excellent though it should have been, the check in process was a big problem","This hotel, staff and amenities was great, they arranged driver and transfers which were excellent.  The pool, spa and dining also were excellent.Check in was a big issue- they said it was due to tech issue, but we went to three rooms with a key and there were people still in the room."
Jul 2016,50,Exceptional Experience,"My sister and I have just enjoyed a truly wonderful few days in the Lisbon Corinthia Hotel. We chose to avail of Executive facilities and this is a really marvellous addition to a hotel stay. The weather was very hot during our stay and we valued the fantastic facility of this lounge with its thrilling views, wide array of snacks which are frequently replenished, great variety of drinks and helpful staff in a quiet, restful environment which allows one follow one's own activities. We also breakfasted in the Executive Lounge and this was a super experience. One can sit at a traditional table/chair, relax on a couch or even sit at the window desk and identify the planes coming into land at Lisbon Airport as they are incredibly near!  The live cooking is fantastic! We loved the omelettes and crepes. Daniel and Valter in the Executive Lounge go beyond the general call of duty to remember your preferences and wishes. We highly commend them both for exceptional service.In the bedroom, the beds and pillows are wonderfully comfortable. Particular acknowledgement and thanks to management that the bottle of water on the desk is complimentary as this was not the case on a previous visit. Housekeeping was attentive to detail and our room on Floor 21 was beautifully prepared anew twice daily.  This is a brilliant hotel giving the guests a beautiful environment with lots of options for relaxation. Altogether a most relaxing holiday. The regular tourist who likes to be pampered should watch this hotel for special offers and sales. This is what we did and these offers bring this fantastic hotel into reach for the regular tourist. Also, when you do this, the Executive Lounge is affordable and it is a great bonus adding hugely to one's stay!Recommendations to ManagementA second armchair and footstool would be lovely in a twin room - our particular room (2121) might not have fittted a second armchair so perhaps it would be better designated a single room?Our room had a trouser press but no iron/ironing board. I am sure the hotel would have been delighted to provide same but one feels that when the quality of service was so high, this would have been automatic. The female Reception and Executive Desk Staff wear a grey uniform which is very drab. I don't think their professionalism would be undermined by a creative touch. Perhaps a little neck scarf in teal to match the ties of their male colleagues would help. They work very hard and     are most dedicated. Such a pity their uniform is grim. Nonetheless, congratulations and sincere thanks to each and every member of staff at the Corinthia for providing us with a memorable stay. Daniel, in the Executive Lounge, commented that he hopes when guests are at home again they miss the luxuries of Corinthia Lisboa and so always remember it. This is certainly the case for us!"
Jul 2016,50,Great,"Went with my family and was very pleased with our stay. Indeed a good hotel with excellent and friendly staff. Good breakfast and nice own restaurant (Tipico). I can gladly recommend this hotel, both for leisure and business. Metrostation is nearby and it is also very cheap to go by taxi in Lisbon."
Jul 2016,50,Amazing,"Great hotel close from Lisbon downtowm: good election if you want to visit the city.5 ⭐️ hotel but not so expensive at all. A big Swimming-pool, very complete gym, zen garden, etc, etcAwesome breakfast buffet (gofres, salads, a lot of types of fruit...)Perfect!"
Jul 2016,40,Metro Station very near,"The metro station is a 1min walk across the hotel (a 2 way trip is 3.60€). Personnel was helpfull and the breakfast buffet includes ommelet station, cold cuts, bread, cereal, tea, yogurt, eggs, among many other options. The only downside was the room's air conditioning: not as cold as you can expect from american hotels. Other couples found the rooms' temp a little bit hot, even though we changed the original temp."
Jul 2016,40,Lisbon,"Nice and comfortable room ,quiet ,clean ,family friendly hotel ,some distance from city center but with Ana underground stop 100 meters away ,great breakfast ,average quality food of hotel restaurant ,nice and safe area"
Jul 2016,50,Lisbon weekend trip,"Our weekend stay in Lisbon was wonderful and a large part of that was due to the Corinthia Hotel. If you don't mind a 10 minute journey via the Metro to the busier Restauradores area then you should consider this. The Metro system is great too. The staff in the hotel were happy to help with advise for train/trams and so on as we explored the city and some of the coastal areas/towns like Belem, Estoril and Cascais. The room was quality too with a view over the city and you could see the planes coming in to the airport nearby. No noise issues here though just a really comfortable room and luxury bed. The hotel was also ideally placed for Lisbon Zoo, just a 5/10 minute walk. Look for a deal on this hotel if you can handle some walking to take in the sights and enjoy the public transport links. Lisbon is an amazing city, this will not be the last time I go there... Next year perhaps."
Jul 2016,50,Amazing hotel,"Front desk staff was amazing and super helpful and the room itself was very clean and elegantly decorated. Abundance of toiletries in case you forgot something and the beds were comfortable. Spacious rooms, comfortable lobby and the proximity to the metro line and bus station (if you want to take a bus to Porto) were super close. There was also a great local cafe (out and to the right, second one down) that had a selection of great pastries and breakfast as well. Overall a great experience and the access to the metro gave access to the city center in minutes."
Jul 2016,30,5 Star hotel hobbled by Service,"Nice 5* hotel, decent location, nice lounge bar with big TV screen for sports events, good spa, good swimming pool. There were pockets of poor service - room not done up in time and requiring repeated follow-ups. I would probably stay there again - all the facilities were good overall. If you are only looking at touring in Lisbon, I think there are good options closer to the old city at similar prices, may not be with the same facilities (such as gym and pool)."
Jul 2016,50,The best in Lisbon ,"We were traveling in a group of friends. The hotel is really nice, very luxurious and great staff! Everything you can expect from a 5-star hotel. Great breakfast with a range of different things to choose from. Very nice spa section. The entrance to the aqua spa was €20 for 2h. Totally worth it! Warm and cold baths, massage showers, jacuzzis and saunas. There is many different treatments to choose from. These are extras though. There is a gym and a bigger pool that you can access for free. Executive club can access the 24th floor, where you have the breakfast with stunning views over Lisbon. I'm very happy with my choice of stay in Lisbon. I'm definitely going back to Corinthia Hotel!"
Jul 2016,50,I think this is one of the best hotels in Lisbon.,I think this is one of the best hotels in Lisbon.Only 5 minutes drive from Lisbon.We stayed at the hotel for 3 days in a Junior Suite Large room.Great breakfast with quality products.Really great aquipped GymMy wife and I really enjoyed this hotel
Jul 2016,40,Good hotel ,"The location is a little north of the main touristy area in the south. Quiet business area and some restaurants and amenities nearby including the train. The room we got was good. Not large, but was clean and had some nice features. Comfy bed.The pool was nice but pretty busy. Had to buy a shower cap for some reason.The parking was expensive at 18 Euro a night. That was excessive. Staff was helpful and kind. Overall a good place to stay."
Jul 2016,50,Best Executive Lounge!,"If you can find a deal for the Executive floor- grab it! Fantastic service, snacks, beer, wine, fabulous breakfast, all in a wonderful room. The hotel itself is very well run, well trained staff (a rarity in Portugal where the service industry is sorely lacking). It is not downtown, but convenient to airport, zoo, metro."
Jul 2016,10,Beware! 5-stars fraud.,"I have enjoyed my stay in this hotel, however everything was nullified (or rather worse) the week after I went back from Lisbon.As always after coming back from abroad, I have checked my bank statement. Apart from the payment for the hotel, I have also found some mysterious 25 EUR charge made by the hotel, a few days later. When I asked hotel what it is about, I was informed that it is charge for the things used from minibar!!!I travel quite a lot but never take anything from minibar as I am not interested in type of drinks/snacks offered and the prices are always ludicrous. It was obvious fraud as nothing was taken from minibar and I my later message with explanation was simply ignored, neither payment was returned to my account.As unauthorized card charge took place, I have reported suspicion of fraud to my bank shortly after this charge was found on my statement and having no answer from them, I will start more formal procedure now. I also decided to present my opinion and describe the case here as it is not possible to treat it as any incidental mistake any longer. I have visited many hotels in many countries during the last few years and shared my opinion here. But such situation never happened to me, even if I usually stay at 3 or 4 star hotels – perhaps I should consider everything as a hidden tax for 5-stars standard?Taking into account the situation happened to me, I highly recommend to all hotel guests who decide to stay in this hotel:- Obtain some confirmation regarding the usage of minibar when checking out (especially when you didn’t take anything at all!);- Check your bank statement for any charges by this hotel, after you are back home;Probably these people thought that “dumb and rich” English will not check their bank statements neither will bother about such little “pocket money” collected by hotel’s staff. But they are wrong in both cases!"
Jul 2016,50,couples,"on the outside it wasn't so surprising, but the bell boys were impecable and once you are on the inside is like you are some where else. It's offer high security standards. In had a great view of Lisbon central city. Service and food was very good."
Jul 2016,40,Distance to downtown OK thanks to good transportation possibilities,"Comfortable, friendly staff. However  - we should have been asked if we wanted a room for non-smokers or smokers when checking in. We arrived late at night and after having checked in and unpacked we noticed a slight smell of smoke in the room. We were to tired to complain, pack again and move to another room. It was however something negative with the stay."
Jul 2016,50,Very enjoyable stay,"Excellent hotel in a quiet location. Minutes from Metro station, and the ride to downtown takes ten to fifteen minutes. There are good restaurants nearby. Dinner buffet at the hotel, at 30 Euros, is I think good value."
Jul 2016,50,Extremely great hotel!,"We had a great trip to Lisbon, and a great stay in Corinthia Hotel. Great service, great food and a nice room. The waiter in the hotel restaurant was a study, in how anyone does their best, at any given time. He seemed like a guy, that really love his job.We would surely like to go back!"
Jul 2016,50,Great,We stayed here 4 nights during our honeymoon trip. We booked an executive suite which we never did before but for this special event we did note care about the money :) what we can say is that we never had a better service before. The hole staff was very friendly and made jokes to our child the hole day :D The room was very comfortable and clean and also our child (1 yr) had a really beautiful bed not such a camping bed like in other hotels. The executive lounge was new for us but quite perfect after a long sightseeing tour and quite perfect to make evening meal for our child because the restaurant opens at 7pm which was to late for the baby :) If we will come back to lisboa we will choose this hotel again. Thanks for this nice stay. Mario&Katja
Jul 2016,50,great hotel and great location,"Stayed a couple of nights (wishing it had been longer) on a  whistle-stop trip to Lisbon from Faro arriving and departing by train.  The location of the hotel couldn't have been better - right beside Sete Rios train station and the Metro we were handy for everything we wanted to do.  The room was lovely and had all of the amenities we could as for - large, comfortable bed, sofa and spacious bathroom.  The only single thing I could ask to be added was a shelf in the bathroom to accommodate toiletries.  Our stay was unfortunately too short to experience everything the hotel had to offer but we would definitely like toreturn"
Jul 2016,50,A very nice hotel with a great team to make your stay a comfortable one,"We generally like the Executive program of the Corinthia hotels and so the choice of hotel for our trip to Lisbon was relatively straight forward. The hotel had a nice atmosphere right from the time we entered the lobby and throughout check-in. The Excecutive rooms are on the upper floors and we were given a room facing the river / bridge and we really loved the view. Room was spacious, nice and comfortable and always clean and serviced with a nice touch. The team on the executive club level could not have been any friendlier and we always felt warmly welcomed and taken care of. Everyone was always willing to help, assist, make things happen and give advice and tipps. When writing this review I was torn between 4 and 5 stars but these people made the difference. One thing to take into account for sure: the hotel is a bit outside the city center, so if you want to be right in the middle of it, maybe not your choice. It is however right on the blue metro, so for us it worked perfectly as a base. There is also some smaller things, that we wish would be changed, but nothing major which would dampen our stay here. I can say that we would always come back here. Maybe not perfect on all points but certainly with character and charme."
Jul 2016,40,"Good hotel, recommended stay.","Hotel facilities are nice. Superb spa and gym area. Rooms are silent, comfortable, and clean. The hotel is a bit far from downtown, but nothing is really far from anything in Lisbon. There is a metro station very near, and that line will take you to baixa chiado in 15 minutes. Give yourself some extra time for checkout since it's a big hotel and you may find lines at the front desk."
Jul 2016,40,Um bom hotel,Its a nice hotel. Very clean. Excellent crew. Rooms are ok. Swimming pool didn't impress. Prices are on target for a five star hotel. Parking is time consuming as the system adopted by the hotel makes no sense. All in all it was a good experience. Will be back.
Jul 2016,40,Comfortable hotel but far from main downtown.,"Comfortable stay, clean rooms, breakfast quality and choices not good, too crowded. Slow service on the terrace. Friendly doorman and staff in general. Would stay somewhere closer to town next time but the connecting family rooms were perfect for us I have to say."
Jul 2016,40,Budget 2017,"It was arranged by my company a meeting for the definition of the Budget for 2017. The structure was really good and the service also. The location was not in a central position, but the overall structure was really ok."
Jul 2016,50,Total luxury.,"Our rooms were done every day, towels changed, beds turned down and a chocolate every night.  All our enquiries were attended to, tours booked and seating arranged for our return flight. Location of Hotel was a bonus right next to the train and bus station."
Jul 2016,50,Lavish 5-star hotel slightly out of town,"Friendly hotel with all the usual amenities of a 5-star. Really nice and helpful people, but that was my general experience of Lisbon. A couple of great restaurants on the street just outside (I can recommend Acacia). The wifi is free. The Super King bed was huge and incredibly comfortable."
Jul 2016,50,Very enjoyable first visit to Portugal,"Conveniently located to the airport, Corinthia Hotel Lisbon met all of my personal and business conference meeting needs.  While I did not use them, it is also conveniently located close to public transportation facilitating easy access to the rest of the city. Very  nice."
Jul 2016,50,"Lovely stay, great staff",Excellent 3 nights here - hotel is modern and comfortable.  Being outside the very centre it's a bit quieter and still has excellent transport links.  The staff are super - a problem with my reservation and a request to housekeeping were sorted out quickly and professionally.  We got excellent rates in the Corinthia sale - not sure I'd have paid rack rate but Corinthia has regular sales!  I would happily stay here again if I return to Lisbon.
Jul 2016,40,excellent hotel 15mn from the center (metro),A nice hotel and a wonderful spa.Not to far from the center. English but not french spoken. Metro is 2 mn from the hotel. Excellent buffet breakfast but dinner and lounge is average for food and beverage.
Jul 2016,50,Great hotel in a great first visit to Portugal,"First first to Portugal, tried to ensure a good hotel was booked and certainly not disappointed.Multi-storey style hotel close to the city centre, great links to the Metro & Railway only a short walk away - 5 mins!Rooms are spacious & well laid out, love the large bathroom and queen size bed.All rooms are reached via 4 lifts, which you access via your room card & floor number - nice touch in my opinion & more secure than your normal hotel.You get free access to WiFi (strong signal & bandwidth), gym & swimming pool. Used all except the gym, but it looked of reasonable size & well equipped too. Also included are a decent sized safe, lots of storage space for clothes etc.Having a great stay & the only negative, but to be expected, are the prices for food & drink. However, there are lots of local food outlets & with easy access to public transport, this is easily avoided.I would strongly recommend this hotel, especially at the price I got for 7 nights room only, less than £600 & that includes flights!Got a couple more days left before heading home, but the hotel has been everything that has been reported."
Jul 2016,50,Every thing is amazing,"Very comfortable place.. Good for couples, families, and business... The breakfast is perfect... The beds are very comfortable .. The pool is nice.. I really recommend it for my family and friends and I will saty there again"
Jul 2016,50,High quality out of the city center ,"Corinthia has impressed us by really making all the efforts to make you feel at a 5 star hotel. Decoration is classy and facility is up to date. Staff is the best trained I've ever seen so far, taking care of everything and always one step ahead (some could feel even intimidated by it). We didn't choose to upgrade so we got a smaller room, though very tastefully decorated, with a comfortable bed, a daily big bottle of water as courtesy, minibar, coffee (instant), the much needed a/c, good wifi and nice bathroom. Although away from the city center, the metro station is right across the street and cabs are really inexpensive in Portugal, so that when with 2 it'll be more interesting to skip metro and get dropped wherever you want for almost the same price. Because we took only 2 days in Lisbon and wanted to make the outmost of it we chose to skip breakfast at the hotel to eat something fast on the way, so I can't comment on it. The same applies for the spa facilities. All I can say is that we enjoyed our short stay and would come back."
Jul 2016,50,Excellent high level hotel,Great experience at Corinthia Hotel Lisbon. You feel you are treated as a king. The lounge reserved for higher package is awesome serving quality food all the day at the 24th floor. Room service is among the best I have ever experienced.
Jul 2016,50,Wonderful place to stay,We recently spent 5 days here. The staff was extremely courteous and always helpful. We ate dinner in the restaurant several nights and always received excellent service and great food from the buffet. Breakfast each morning was delicious as well. Guest services did a super job helping us book tours and find our way around Lisbon. No complaints at all about anything. Would definitely stay there again!
Jul 2016,50,Wonderful family stay!,"Arrived early and luggage was held while we took a van tour of Lisbon. Staff was beyond helpful. Had arranged our van rental in Faro and drop off in Lisbon with a call from the states prior to visit. It was a Mercedes. When we arrived in faro, euro car said we would never have gotten thAt price walking in. Also Arranged airport transport in a wonderful private bus. Upgraded my husband and I as we were celebrating our 50th anniversary. Rooms were modern, clean and comfortable. Location was good , outside crowded tourist area but convenient. Delicious fish restaurant across street.The loveliest part of all was the outside garden with water features where we had cocktails and hors d'oevres while relaxing and listening to live musical entertainment.A most wonderful stay by all. A great last night to our trip!"
Jul 2016,50,Excellent Hotel in Lisbon,"This is a marvelous hotel. The rooms are impeccable, the staff is attentive and helpful. While this hotel is not located in the heart of old Lisbon, it is an easy ten minute metro ride away. The metro station is across the street. Upgrade to the ""executive"" level for access to rooms on the upper floors and access to the executive lounge on the top floor. It is worth it. Highly recommended."
Jul 2016,40,Very Nice Hotel !,"My wife and I stayed here when we visited Lisbon for a short break recently. Our room was perfectly fine and although the bed was comfortable unfortunately the pillows were like bricks ! The general hotel facilities were great however the bar prices were particularly steep when compared to the bars and restaurant prices in town.The food at breakfast was very good and the staff in every area of the hotel were helpful ,polite and attentive. So if you don't mind a commute into the city centre by all means choose this hotel."
Jul 2016,50,Very clean and high scale,"If you are staying a night or a week in Lisbon, this is the hotel for you! It is half way to main city attractions and Airport. The staff is very helpful and the service is 5 star rated. the room is big and is beautiful. I recommend the breakfast buffet in the morning, it is worth the money. I having nothing negative to say about my stay, it was perfect from beginning to end!"
Jul 2016,40,Excellent hotel,"Amazing staff, french and eglish speakers. Good location close to metro. Excellent breakfast quality. Only problem is inside pool, too small and crowded, spa facilities not incuded. Overall, very good stay, will definitely try again."
Jul 2016,50,Very good!,"I stayed in a suite, thus had the Executive Club treatment, both at my arrival (dedicated check-in) and at breakfast (Sky Lounge on the 24th floor).The hotel is very clean in all its areas and the personnel is kind and helpful.There is a very nice external bar / breakfast area on the ground floor as well.The driving distance from Lisbon center is about 7-10 minutes. There is a taxi station right in front of the hotel's entrance - very handy! and the cost to/from the downtown is around 6-7 euro only. There are anyhow very good public transports available too.The airport is near (10 min taxi drive).The hotel room (suite) was equipped with 1st class products, and definitely comfortable. The views over the city from the 22nd floor were wonderful.The breakfast in the Sky Lounge was good and the personnel prepared the warm drinks and the omelettes as requested. But maybe I would have expected a bit more variety from a place of that level.The swimming pool looked nice but I didn't unfortunately have the chance to try it.If you are looking for a high-category business hotel, this one is surely a good choice."
Jul 2016,50,Incomparable,"Not just a ""standard"" 5-star hotel. This place has an almost historic, classic style. It has a spirit, that is expressed in it's staffs dedication and throughout evert little detail in the designs.Spirit and design is what characterises this hotel and what makes your stay a personal experience"
Jul 2016,40,Lovely hotel ,"Lovely hotel in a great location, right by the metro station and the zoo! 15% discount for the zoo provided by the hotel. Zoo is a must visit - although limited choices to eat in the complex. I would suggest eating before or after the visit. We opted for McDs just to be on the safe side. Only stayed one night here as it was only 10 mins from the airport.The only let down was that they only allow you to enter the pool if you were wearing a swimming hat! Other than that the pool/outside lounge area was well kept and a lovely area to sit and relax. I would definitely stay here again! A cheaper and just as nice option is the hotel Acores (ten mins walk from corinthia)! Stayed there for a couple days before here. They had a better choice of TV channels and included free breakfast! Although they didn't have a pool."
Jul 2016,40,We loved our stay very much,"The hotel is situated near the train station SETE rios, with very good connections to Sitra (the royal city by the sea) and the metro with easy access to the center of Lisbon. But the hotel itself isn't in the citycenter. So if you want a hotel there this is not for you. But if you like a fairly new hotel with lots os possibilities, spa, pool, fitness and so on, this could be the one for you.Its not a charming 24 floor high building, but you get great views over the city form the rooms.We were on the 21 th floor in an executive junior suite and had access to the lounge on the 24th floor. Here we had a nice breakfast and the lounge serves snack the hole day. And softdrinks, beer, champagne, red and white wine. And a lots of sweet things, cookies, desserts and so on. In my opinion to much sweets? and the snack are really tiny. The call it canapés, but all the same, were tiny and also very interesting all together. Its suppose to be something exclusive, but it just seem to be a carrotstik, some nuts, olives and so on. Not really canapé.The room was very nice and large, with a very nice bathroom. And the view was great.BUT, the planes landing at the airport almost fly next to the building and they do make a some noise.The service is excellent, the staff at the hotel are just great and nothing is to difficult a request for the. We had an evening train at 9pm and had access to the lounge all day, even after check-out. On the day of arrival we couldn't check in (we came early, 10am), but they insisted that we went for breakfast at the lounge.  So service is the key word when staying at the Corinthia. W tried the restaurant on the last evening and it was very nice."
Jul 2016,40,Really enjoyed our stay at his hotel.,"Good comfortable large rooms with superb bed, quiet and only a 8 Euro taxi ride into the centre of Lisbon. Reception staff on arrival where very efficient and the other staff were ok.     There is a 'subway' just up the road as well as a supermarket, some cafe's and restaurants.  There is a well equipped gym and rather nice pool.All good."
Jul 2016,50,"Upscale, modern & luxurious",Hotel Corinthia was a highlight of our time in Lisbon! It felt like a spa/resort experience and I am pleased that it was an option for the See Tickets NOS Alive festival ticket package otherwise I may not have heard of this hotel. We used VRBO for other stays on this trip around Spain and Portugal which were nice also but sometimes you just need that comfortable stay and Corinthia was just that! We had another home stay arranged and paid for for the final night before leaving Portugal to return home to Canada but we instead returned to the Corinthia to have one last great night in Lisbon! The nearby restaurants and general location close to major freeways was another bonus. Some patrons of the hotel sure seemed to stare at us - not sure if it was our casual attire or that we are a mixed enthnicity couple - nevertheless we are confident in who we are and didn't care what the seemingly uptight patrons thought of us.
Jul 2016,50,An interesting city break,"This is a classy hotel, and well deserving of its five-star status. The rooms are excellent (we paid a small sum to upgrade to a junior suite) and the beds vast and comfortable. The breakfast buffet is pretty good, the experience augmented by a very efficient egg chef.Some people might be put off by the hotel's location in the business district, outside the normal tourist areas, but there's a metro station nearby where you can get an all-day pass for Lisbon's comprehensive network of light rail, buses and trams. A taxi to the main seaside area of the city costs a little over six euro, though the metro is cheaper, if a little less comfortable at peak hours.Concierge service at the Corinthia is first class, and they'll arrange tours and other amenities with little bother. The picturesque town of Sintra is well worth seeing, as is Cascais/Estoril farther up the coast, and you can arrange to be picked up at the hotel by a shuttle bus, and returned at the end of your trip.There are several good restaurants near the hotel, including a seafood one just across the road, which is very good and very reasonably priced."
Jul 2016,40,A Birthday Surprise,"This hotel has a Grand opulent foyer and helpful reception staff. The concierge desk took our bags to our room. The room was quoted spacious but a little tied.I'm not one to be negative as I was in Lisbon to site see, eat at fine restaurants and experience the culture.That's exactly what we did we didn't eat at the hotel restaurant but we After a short flight we were off the plane and into a private taxi and in the hotel within half an hour. We were greeted by the door man that lead us into an opulent grandeur foyer. The staff were friendly and efficient and our bags were delivered by the concierge to our room. The room to be honest was a little tied. The bed was very comfortable. I won't over analysis as we were here to experience history,culture and the food so as long as the bed comfortable and the bathroom was clean I was quite pleased. Itook full advantage of the gym swimming pool and sauna. I couldn't fault it as there were clean towels and jugs of fruit and water. I felt very relaxed in both and the cleanliness was second to none. As for the city of Lisbon it had everything for me the blend of the old town meeting the new. The culture and the food would encourage me to want to go again.I must also mention that after visiting the Monestry (which is a must see) on my birthday and experiencing the best of the weather. We started the birthday celebrations at about 4pm by having a couple of beers at Rossio Square. When we got back to our hotel by the easy accessible tube we were totally surprised to find a chocolate cake with Happy Birthday written in pipework and a bottle of champagne. They even had a typed note congratulating me. The attention to detail was second to none. After getting over a long day we decided to have a quick power nap. This didn't go to plan as we woke close to 9pm. Panic and a quick rush to get ready to continue my Birthday.I need not have worried as the help at reception was impeccable. I knew what I wanted and they truly delivered. I wanted a top of the range Portuguese restaurant in the heart of town that gave a good range food that would compliment a bottle of fine wine. They truly gave me that and they took it a step further I was greeted by the waiter who was a perfect gentleman. He knew all about he's food and wine. I also requested a Jazz club to end the night and the reception desk were spot on. Not only did our waiter served us with impeccable manners and professionalism he was also instructed by the Corinthia reception staff to escort us to a small jazz club just a 100 yards from the restaurant. It was a birthday to remember.Many thanks to all the staff in the Corinthia Hotel you made our time there very magical."
Jul 2016,50,Flawless!,"Every aspect and detail was exceptional.  Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff and we felt pampered throughout our stay.  Breakfast buffet covered every conceivable requirement and coffee cup was kept constantly topped up! Great location for jumping on the Metro for downtown or a train to Sintra, and the zoo just a short walk away."
Jul 2016,50,Lovely stay here.,"Stayed at this hotel with our 16 year old,hotel room was top class,breakfst buffet was delicious plenty of everything.There was no out door pool but the indoor pool is very nice,although we were not too happy having to pay to use the spa facilitys.The price of alchol in the bar in my opinion is outrages two glasses of beer cost thirteen euro.On my return home I discovered that my credit card was charged Five euro after  I checked out for a missing plastic laundry bag,i contacted the hotel directly and after an exchange of emails they eventually reimbursed my card."
Jul 2016,40,Great stay!,"Stayed at the Corinthia for 5 nights on business. Overall very nice stay. Very nice, clean hotel with friendly and helpful staff. The hotel amenities were great, and the food was good. Located well with a short metro ride to the cite centre and a good selection of restaurants surrounding it."
Jul 2016,40,Very comfy beds and secure hotel,"Nice, comfortable beds. Room was a bit small for an Executive room, but my friend got a ""regular"" room and it was way bigger? Wifi was decent. Not very many plugs to plug in my laptop and phone. Shower was nice and hot with good pressure. Staff was super friendly and helpful."
Jul 2016,50,Made to feel most welcome,From the moment I arrived the staff could not have been more helpful and the concierge was consistently jovial and helpful. All areas of the hotel were spotless and room excellent. Only one minor point was relatively small pool but other gym facilities excellent.
Jul 2016,50,Great for business,"Good location and great facilities. Can't go wrong for what a typical business traveler needs. Room was great though bathroom, compared to other hotels in other European cities was less than. Basically, no reason not to stay here. Corinthian is a brand to trust."
Jul 2016,30,Lisbon,This property has a great outdoor terrace area but service lacks enthusiasm. Drinks were overpriced. Staff was mostly helpful on Checkin but a few of the females at front did not seem to be willing to answer questions without being perceptively irritated.
Jul 2016,50,Glorious,"We spent two weeks between Spain and Portugal and the breakfast at the Corinthia was one of highlights. My friends and I especially enjoyed the fresh waffles and made to order omelettes.  The room itself was also very nice. There is restaurant to the right of the hotel that was so good, we ate there twice."
Jul 2016,40,international quality,"It is a big hotel. The restaurant is good. Big notes to the way they serve dinner desert: tinny portions you can taste and came back to have more many times. The room is large and confortable, good bathroom. the essecnial decoration."
Jul 2016,50,Lovely hotel,"Don't be put off by the fact that this hotel isn't in the centre of town. The metro is across the road, takes 10 minutes and is very cheap (€6 for a 24 hour, ride as often as you like ticket). It's really quiet and the facilities are great. The pool and outdoor sun terrace is a particular bonus. The breakfast selection and quality was great. We found the service in the breakfast restaurant and the Tempus bar a little slow when it was busy. We also thought the Tempus bar food was very pricy for the portion size. It was my husbands birthday and they brought champagne and a personalised chocolate cake to our room. That made the stay really special."
Jul 2016,40,Corinthia Lisbon,"Good: The bed - extremely comfortable, slept like a log.  The room - nicely appointed, clean and comfortable. Customer service - very friendly and professional.Bad: Check in / check out speed very slow.  Multiple queues meant it was a free for all.  Food - generally average.  Terrace bar service - slow.Would I stay again - definitely, especially for a good night's sleep, however, would probably eat out more."
Jul 2016,40,Great business conference at the Corinthia,"Very enjoyable stay, friendly and helpful staff, room and bathroom were spotless.  Staff always willing to assist with any requests.  Made me feel like the would go above and beyond to assist.  Breakfasts were good, had a buffet dinner on the Sunday evening and it was amazing.  Highly recommended"
Jul 2016,30,lovely hotel,"Disappointing that this is yet another hotel where there are no plug sockets close enough to the bed to allow you to charge your phone during the night and have it close to you to be able to use your phone as your alarm clock.  Also, no sockets within easy reach of a mirror, so using hair appliances was a little difficult if you want to be able to see what you are doing!  why can't they install a mirror over the desk?!  Waiting time at terrace bar was around 50min for food, would have expected the staff resourcing to have been increased to align with number of guests..."
Jul 2016,50,superb,"Exceptional and outstanding location, choice, staff, proximity to center, zoo, bus, train station, metro, etc... The manager and staff were ALL outstanding in their courtesy, attention, etc. A beautiful hotel and an exceptional value for the price..."
Jul 2016,40,Company Bootcamp,"Great room, convenient facility for the company meeting that I attended. Not far from the city center and from the airport. Breakfast buffet was OK and the lounge bar was very pleasant: inside and outside. It's highly likely that I would come back with the family."
Jul 2016,30,Business Hotel,"average hotel, ok for business travelLocated 10min to the town center by taxi and optional a metro station round the corner. The breakfast and lunch in the buffet restaurant is quite good but optional beverages and food in the bar is more expensive than outside"
Jul 2016,40,Business Conference ,Modern well located hotel. Very good service by staff... Food was just okay but plenty of choice. Conferencing facilities were very good.Particularly impressed by their bar including outside mega screen shouting the Euro Championships.
Jul 2016,50,Unforgettable stay,"Nothing to say aside flawless service. Daniel from the executive is the best. Experience to repeat. The service was immaculate, the tidiness of the room was spot on, the attention to details the same, nothing bad."
Jul 2016,50,"Lovely hotel, but a bit far out","Stayed here for three nights. It's a lovely hotel that is deserving of its 5 star status. The room was lovely - if a little small - and the service was exemplary, as you'd expect.It's quite far from the centre of Lisbon (or at least the ""happening"" part of Lisbon), which we didn't really realise when booking. A taxi costs around €7-8 to the centre.It has a lovely pool/spa, but in order to use the pool you need to have a swimming cap, which can be purchased for €5. Not only is this very unusual - given that no one packs a shower cap when visiting a hotel - this essentially amounts to a €5 supplement to use the pool facilities. To use the sauna/spa area you also have to pay €20 (per visit); in a 5 star hotel you would expect this to be included in the room rate.We didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment on the food, but they have at least 2 restaurants, one of which is a buffet (which did look nice).Would definitely return if visiting the city again."
Jul 2016,30,"Disappointing stay, room service non existent and spa reflexology poor",No room sevice - no answer and reception unable to assist when requested. Reflexology very poor and a waste of money. Room dusty and carpet unclean in spots. Guest services good and chocolates a mie touch
Jul 2016,40,"Lovely staff, great beds and breakfast!","We stayed here for a long weekend visit. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The beds are fab and the breakfast is plentiful. Nice lounge and terrace too. Not located in city centre, but very close to the Metro. The gym is well equipped and air conditioned. The pool and sundeck are nice for relaxing after a day of walking. Only tip, maybe serve drinks there? Haven't tried the Spa for lack of time, but it looked nice. In house Restaurant Tipico has 2 options: the buffet which looked good and the a la carte menu, which has some lovely dishes. It is about 10-15min from the airport by taxi, but no airplane noise inside the hotel. Would stay here again."
Jul 2016,50,"Great hotel, conveniently located next to Sete Rios Railway station","Very friendly staff, helpful in every possible way The room turned out to be on a smokers level, but was changed immediately to a non-smoking room. Great service overall, good and stable wifi. Two minor drawbacks: food/drinks are overly priced (€20 for breakfast, €5 for a soft drink) ; the room card expired before noon, which was the check-out time. This was however quickly dealt with."
Jul 2016,50,"Outstanding hotel in all respects - location, comfort, friendliness and cleanliness.",The hotel is excellently located just a short (11 euro) taxi ride from the airport. The hotel is sited immediately adjacent to the tube station giving you access to the whole of lisbon for near to no money at all (you can also get to the hotel from the airport easily by tube too - we did this on the return journey). The welcome was amazing and we were treated to a room upgrade to include the sky lounge and a free one day entry to their spa.The room was very spacious and excellently presented. I took photos to model my own house bedroom on this design ! The view was spectacular from the 21st floor of both the suspension bridge and christ the redeemer.The breakfasts were plentiful and full of variety. We went to the tipico restaurant one of the nights and I had the best duck-on-rissotto I have ever had.Our whole stay was fabulous and I can not recommend this hotel highly enough. There are no negatives for me to mention !
Jul 2016,40,"Week long stay, very good","I've stayed at Corinthia Hotel for one weekend and it was very good. With the exception of prices everything else was a great experience, but it is a 5* hotel after all. I'd recommend staying at this hotel."
Jul 2016,50,24 hours of total luxury,"Arriving after 20 days cruising through Portugal in a camper van, staying 24 hours in Corinthia was an delightful relaxation and the cherry on the cake for our honeymoon. Indulging in outstanding food, delicious cocktails and champaign, and a perfect room with delightful bed was pure bliss."
Jul 2016,50,Brilliant time,"Brilliant time in Lisbon hotel was excellent comfortable rooms spacious bed very comfortable clean tidy modern , location location location was perfect easy access the train is literally a few minutes walk absolutely brilliant"
Jul 2016,50,Wonderful Stay,"Beautiful hotel with quiet large room.  While hotel is a little far from city center, an inexpensive cab ride takes you into the center within 15 minutes.  Convenient restaurants, grocery store nearby hotel."
Jul 2016,50,Pampered,"The team at the Corinthia Hotel, Lisbon were so incredibly welcoming.  They made our stay this past week so enjoyable.  Ana from Guest Services, Pedro the assistant manager, the staff at the Terrace lounge, Dennis in the Executive lounge all made our family experience in Lisbon phenomenal.  We will be booking again in the future.  I highly encourage families and couples to holiday at the Corinthia."
Jun 2016,50,Luxurious Lisbon Hotel,Fantastic hotel located close to the zoo garden and access to the underground Metro. The experience was great with friendly staff.The executive room is superb and the aqua spa was exceptional.I will definately visit the hotel again.
Jun 2016,50,fantastic hotel with fantastic service!,"Just a lovely hotel, they cannot do enough to help! We stayed in an executive room, it wasn't very big but had everything you need. The executive lounge was a great place to unwind and get drinks and snacks throughout the day. The bars and restaurants are fantastic, it is a but pricey but it is a 5 star hotel."
Jun 2016,40,Meetings,"Overall it was a good experience Only 2 things to be improved according to me- elevators are too slow. Sometimes we wait a lot. For example at breakfast time- meeting rooms were cold, especially the 1st day"
Jun 2016,50,Top Hotel and impeccable service ,"We have stayed in this magnificent hotel for 3 nights. Our great stay started when we checked in... Rita the receptionist informed us that we were selected as guest of the day and we could profit from a free upgrade. :) ver nice feeling!! Not only they upgraded us in a better room, they also included breakfast free of charge which we could taste on the top terrace of the hotel. Amazing view from the 24th floor!! :) we felt really VIP guests and are so great full for the special welcome! The room was very spacious and with a nice welcome card, fruits, bottle of Porto wine and little ""pasteis de nata"". It was great to swim early in the morning as the swimming pool was not so busy. The location of this hotel is also perfect thanks to only 2 minutes from subway station. Do not hesitate and book your stay in this nice hotel!"
Jun 2016,40,Family Visit,"Lovely place, would definitely go again. Although it is slightly overpriced, I couldn't complain about the service or indeed how friendly the staff were and how well we were looked after. Would seriously recommend it, absolutely beautiful place"
Jun 2016,40,Nice hotel,"Very nice and comfortable hotel. Not near the city center but one step away from metro and train station. Is more a business hotel rather then a leisure one, but the service is top even if a bit slow from time to time(waited more than 30 minutes for 4 tapas and a bottle of water)"
Jun 2016,40,"Lovely staff, great service","Nice hotel but a bit far out of town. All the common parts are very stylish but the rooms are a bit dated with furniture that's seen better days. Comfy mattress but awful pillows - like slabs of foam. However, the staff were great and the food was excellent."
Jun 2016,50,Great value for money hotel,"Paid very modest amount for upgrade to executive room, and very glad we did. Received a lot of help with practical issues from executive concierges. The hotel is really comfortable and great value for money. Highly recommend!"
Jun 2016,50,Nice Hotel and Great Location,The hotel is located very close to the metro and it is very convenient. The rooms have ample space as I was sharing the room with my colleague.and it has enough space to host two people. The hotel provide free Wifi which was vital for business travelers.
Jun 2016,50,A wonderful treat,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful room. A fantastic location right by metro, centrally located and yet not right downtown.Great feature worth the stay is the holding on to your luggage past the checkout time."
Jun 2016,40,Good choice (but not for everybody),"I was not the one to chose the hotel for my trip, so I was a little bit lost with the location. It's next to the zoo - which is great if you plan a visit there - and close to the metro - giving very convenient connection to the city Centre. Still, I have no idea why this area would be so popular (there are a few more hotels of known chains in the vicinity). The hotel itself is very good. We had access to the club lounge. Very nice, with quite a nice breakfast, which you can enjoy in peace and good selection of drinks in the afternoon. Our son had birthday during our stay and the hotel offered a nice cake (very nice gesture, thanks once again). The pool is sufficiently big, only the caps are obligatory. If you fail to bring your own, you'll get to pay 5 EUR. Not cool. Moreover, things such as sauna or jacuzzi are located in the area where even hotel guests have to pay. Not cool again. The fitness center looks decent, but I haven't used it...Overall, a nice - even though not very new - hotel with good facilities. Not for people who want to feel the pulse of the city. The area is rather deserted and looks a bit like cheap version of Abu Dhabi (wide roads, not-so-nice tall apartment buildings)."
Jun 2016,40,7 day stay in June 2016,Reception staff outstanding and the doormen were always willing to help and advise. The bed in the junior suite was exceptional in its size and comfort. No issues with breakfast or occasional evening meal. Its location makes it a € 10 taxi trip into town but the metro is close by. Bar prices not cheap at € 12 for a g&t - but hey it's a 5 star hotel.
Jun 2016,40,Great stay in Lisbon!,"We recently stayed at Corinthia for a discovery weekend. We arrived earlier than the check-in time, and we were expecting to leave our luggage and come back at the right time, but we got our room straight away since the guys at the reception immediately found a solution to not leave us waiting for the check-in time!Clean and very lightful room, you can control everything of your booking by the interactive menu of the tv.the Staff was very friendly and helpful, especially in giving us hints for our visit.Good breakfast and very good lounge and terrace bar!Didn't manage to try the SPA and gym, purpose for next time!"
Jun 2016,50,Matthew Ewan,First class in every area.Quality of staff was very impressive.very convenient to airport.lift system was the best I have ever experienced.When I go back to Lisbon I will definitely stay at this hotel.
Jun 2016,40,Lisbon 4 night break,"Modern facilities, great ambience and staff in the public areas; super breakfasts all made for a comfortable stay. Metro adjacent allows easy access to the city and beyond. Excellent comfy, massive , bed but some aspects of the room/bathroom a tad dated and a little tired, although spotlessly clean."
Jun 2016,50,City break,"We really enjoyed Lisbon & the Corinthia hotel was great. Has a beautiful reception area, spacious rooms and excellent staff. The bed was very comfortable and we slept like a dream. (Soundproof & blackout).   Everything was clean and of good quality, from the towels to the toiletries and the mattress and bedding are quality too. Only one thing to point out & I'm sure this can be rectified - a mirror is needed close to a plug socket for using the hairdryer.  Plenty of room to unpack and be comfortable, highly recommended. Loved the outside area too , very relaxing."
Jun 2016,50,"Not the best location, but what a great hotel.","Situated several Metro stations from the main drag/old town (7 from memory), could be a little off-putting for some, however the reality is that sometimes it's nice to be distanced from the madding crowd - so to speak. Then again, given that we had 6 nights in Lisbon, we had ample opportunity to indulge in most of the things we wanted, and making life easier was how there is a ""Yellow Bus"" hop on hop off bus stop only some 100 metres or so from the rear of the hotel! Realistically, these hop on and off buses provide arguably the best means of getting to see everything one could want in a city as diverse as Lisbon.One of the prime reasons for booking Corinthia was because it has a Club facility associated with their Executive Suites. For my wife and I, having enjoyed the virtues of many a club room, it was a no brainer, however it didn't prove to be quite as good as expected.Let me explain; traditionally a club room offers a fairly diverse range of nibbles, breakfast, drinks, coffee etc, as well as various pastries and a large range of non and alcoholic drinks. All of which are included in the cost of the room and you are invited to enjoy as much or as little as you like.Unlike many other Club rooms, the Corinithia experience excluded all spirits meaning the only alcoholic offerings include red and white wine, Champagne and beer. But it certainly isn't the end of the world.Rather, the breakfast offerings were exceptional in that a chef was on hand to custom make omelette and crepes, plus of course there's a vast array of other goodies. Enough to appease? Well, one morning we decided to cast aside our top floor eating habits and partake in the ground floor 'breakfast for all' costing 20 or 30 Euro per head, can't remember, but of course as an Executive Suite resident breakfast is included.In any event, whereas there was more of a choice downstairs, the ambience, the whole thing just fell vastly short of the club. So we didn't bother again. Getting back to the Club, depending on your likes and dislikes, your desire to eat out or to eat in, one can literally make the Club be their breakfast, lunch and dinner stop. This isn't the intention of the hotel, however they have no issue given that you are paying a decent premium for an executive suite. Also note that, typically speaking, the club hosted no more than say a dozen or so people, and given that it could have probably coped easily with 60 or more, you almost felt as if it's your private den of inequity. Although not as great as some, it was still terrific and that included the wonderful staff, the amenities, the newspapers and magazines, et al.The suite itself is now 12 years old (it was in 2004 that the hotel was refurbished), hence it is showing some signs of wear. Furthermore, it offers an extremely 'stiff' or traditional feel. This said, I loved it. From the insanely comfortable King bed and the amazing pillows, to a shower that lathered you in all the water you could handle, to the second bathroom (or powder room), the living area with wonderful desk, couch, coffee table, other associated goodies and of course the big screen LCD TV. The bedroom also had its own good sized TV and the channels and movies were a treat. Storage is excellent, however when I realised there were only around 6 or 8 coat hangers in the large wardrobe area and asked for more, the response was no less than an additional 20 hangers. Now that's service for you.Indeed, the overall experience, particularly when in an executive suite, is one of opulence, from having your own VIP desk and staff member (for personalised service and bookings), to a wonderful foyer, huge dining areas (3 in all on the ground floor) four if you count the rear Terrace Lounge. What an absolutely gorgeous facility, something one really must partake in to believe.The overall experience at Corinthia was one of pure unadulterated luxury (with a few minor issues as mentioned), and one that I would hope we can enjoy again in the future.On a parting note, I have to mention Club attendant, Daniel. What a guy. He was so helpful, he was amazing in really assisting in making ours a memorable stay."
Jun 2016,40,"good, but...","Nice hotel near metro station, fine hall and dear staff. the room was large enough with a great view   but some details in the room, like the fixed shower head, the bad smell into the choset and beds made up approximately disappointed us."
Jun 2016,50,Good hotel,"Good hotel with good links to transport to city centre  (Metro 10 minutes to centre) and Sintra.  Only reason we would not stay again is we have no plans to return to Lisbon - lovely city, we just holiday in different places each year."
Jun 2016,50,Birthday Weeked,"I have just returned from a weekend away in Lisbon with a few friends and again we choose to stayed at the Corinthia hotel, our favourite place to stay in Lisbon, nice and relaxing with amazing and very friendly staff. I would like to thank the entire team to make this date again very special.Lovely and clean room with a stunning view. The terrace is just such a relaxing place with lovely cocktails to choose  from. What to say about the pool, we always love to spend sometime by the pool after a day in the beach which are very accessible from this hotel. We drove in Lisbon but if you don't want to rent a car, there is buses from Praça de Espanha to Costa da Caparica the other side of the river with lovely and stunning beaches.Definitely recommend Corinthia hotel If you are used to excellence costumer service.Once again thank you."
Jun 2016,50,Confortable,"It's confortable and placed in a comfy site (near Sete Rios station) to reach every place also by public transport (bus for Fatima, bus from and for airport, metro). Breakfast is complete and full with everything."
Jun 2016,50,Service and views!,"Located near the metro, Corinthia provides a quick and convenient to most part of Lisbon. Having experienced the brand before, I strongly recommend it as excellent value and service with other most famous five star properties; service is fantastic and rooms are refreshed a few times a day. All the personnel has a strong dedication to the guests and are going that extra miles to make your sejour memorable!!!!"
Jun 2016,50,Beautiful Hotel in Beautiful Lisbon,"We really enjoyed Lisbon and will return for sure.  The Corinthia hotel has a beautiful lobby, spacious rooms and excellent staff.  The bed was very comfortable and we slept like a dream.  Everything was clean and of good quality, from the towels to the shampoo and the mattress and bedding are quality.  Plenty of room to unpack and be comfortable, highly recommended. Our stay was flawless!"
Jun 2016,40,Great comfort hotel,"With all staff taking care of all details, it was a great experience to be at this hotel. Normally the fascillities create the difference between 4 and 5 star experience. In this hotel it is certainly the attitude of the staff in general. Superb!"
Jun 2016,40,Not satisfied,"Totally not so bad, but following matters are disappointing. My orders were forgotten. (1) Not assigned to Non-smoking room although my colleagues whose reservation and checking in were both after me were assigned. (2) Iron was not prepared although the mail from customer service said ""everything will be perfectly arranged"".Furthermore, a front service took a long, long time for check-in as he asked his colleague all procedures step by step."
Jun 2016,40,Overal experience,"It was funtastic experience I had in Corinthia and remember able one I had. I will surely return,  I loved Corinthia from Malta onwards, so from that time I decided I will stay all my future hotels with Corinthia when I am Europe next time."
Jun 2016,30,Fine,"The hotel's location is great - very close to the airport and around 15mins into town and all key attractions. A taxi from the airport was only 8 euro and we bought a 24hr ticket from the local metro station which allowed us to use all public transport (bus,trams,metro etc).The hotel's reception and spa/pool area were very nice but the room was nothing special and not 5* quality. We had booked a junior suite so if you are looking for the wow factor probably upgrade. We found the staff to be hit and miss - some were very helpful,others rude and disinterested e.g. one night we waited on our drinks for 20mins and when we enquired if they were on the way, the waiter was rude and basically told us it was our fault for sitting were he couldn't see us. The food in the hotel was very good - would highly recommend the passion fruit creme brulee and the buffet! Overall the hotel was grand nothing spectacular. Not sure if I would stay here again."
Jun 2016,20,Not as good as other Corinthia Hotels,"Having stayed in three other Corinthia Hotels (and eaten in the one in London), this was the only time I have been disappointed. Our Executive room was very small by comparison to those in the other hotels and there was a surprising amount of noise audible from adjoining bedrooms. Some staff were great (the chefs in the Lounge at breakfast stand out) but others were not so great. I rang reception very late one night  to ask what time a very noisy event outside the hotel might finish only to be told it was not their responsibility - which it wasn't, but that was not a great answer. Also - families beware, there are a number of stupid rules  - we could not play cards with our children in public areas and everybody was required to wear swimming hats in the pool. Both of these were blamed on Portugese laws but had been entirely absent in another hotel earlier in the week. There are some good points - the Executive Lounge was the best of the Corinthia hotels that we have experienced. But generally, the Hotel is a fairly non-descript modern tower block in a seemingly remote part of town. We deliberately booked the Corinthia because we absolutely loved the hotels on Malta and in Budapest but were relatively disappointed by this one"
Jun 2016,40,A comfortable stay,"We were lucky enough to stay in a very lovely Executive Suite at the Corinthia. It is a great, if rather corporate, hotel with all that you need and the most amazingly comfortable beds (I want those pillows!). It is not exactly central, but as it is only a 10 minute Metro ride away from the centre we didn't find this too much of a problem and the bonus is that it's only a 10 euro taxi from the airport. We did have a couple of small issues but these were dealt with in a very friendly, efficient way (though one of the older waiters in the Terrace Lounge could certainly do with a bit of re-training!). A real treat was breakfast in the Executive Lounge. A calm oasis with a great view made for a very enjoyable way to start the day. I would definitely recommend."
Jun 2016,20,"Overrated, standard issue international hotel","Currently staying here for 4 nights. Room & bathroom very small, bathroom floor never appears clean despite my complaints (many, many urine (?) blotches around the toilet), stained carpets. When I'm paying 150+ euro per night, I expect better. Breakfast is OK; other facilities are standard. A bit too far out from the centre. I would not stay here again."
Jun 2016,50,Excellent in service and clean,"It is a 5 star hotel with normal sized rooms, very good breakfast and very clean. They change bed sheets every day. It is not central. 4-5 stops  of metro away from the city center, but there is close to it the metro station, a big mall and the zoo. The taxi to the city center costs 5-7 euro"
Jun 2016,50,Delightful Stay,This was our first visit to Lisbon and we enjoyed it tremendously. Having a friendly comfortable place to come back to after a day of sight-seeing was something we looked forward to.We strongly recommend this hotel.
Jun 2016,40,Nice Hotel,"Nice hotel located close to the metro - 3 min walk.Has good amenities (spa, pool, gym, beutiful terrace, exec lounge).Staff were very friendly and helpful - found some of the management staff very rude."
Jun 2016,50,"Convenient ,family frendly and accommodating!","Staff are fantastic!!! From the waiters in the restaurants, to the concierge to the front desk  They take care of you with a smile!>  They even sent someone to my room with a hand held luggage scale so I could plan my packing for the way home!Nice meeting room amentities also.  the only thing not up to par was the coffee served at the restaurant and at lunch  Disappointing.  BUT the beautiful buffet and omelette station for breakfast and outdoor dining made up for this.   The rooms are comortable and efficient. Nice bathroom and inroom amenities  Bed is super comfortable.  The gym pool and spa very good.  Even has a yoga and stretch room    Nice stay!!Easy to get to the city via the metrostation across the street and convenient from the airport only 20-25 minute for a 10Euro cab ride!highly recommended"
Jun 2016,50,Wonderful week in Lisbon,"This is my fourth time to stay at Corinthia Hotel Lisbon and I look forward to my next visit.  Outstanding hotel and superb service.  I enjoyed everything including breakfast, meeting facilities, gym and beautiful outdoor setting in the bar area."
Jun 2016,40,TOP CLASS HOTEL...NOT SO SURE ABOUT ITS LOCATION FOR TOURISTS,"This is a very good 5 star hotel with all the amenities you would expect. Very smart lobby, terrific comfy rooms. state of the art elevators, etc. Friendly reception. It is about 20 minutes taxi drive from the airport, therefore a good place to stay overnight while waiting for your next-day flight. Fabulous view over Lisbon (the Bridge over the River Tagus, etc).My one concern for ordinary tourists visiting Lisbon would be the location: It´s an easy taxi ride into the true centre of  Lisbon (about 10 euros only), but this might put some people off a bit. I could seen no simpatico eating places around the hotel area either, so you are stuck with the hotel restaurant (reputed to be good).  I noted that the Mercure, Ibis etc are located in roughly the same area. You get my drift?A tip: I stayed at the extremely good Hotel NH Libertadores last year: Extremely convenient downtown super modern hotel on the main avenue. You might wish to try it. it is in the same price bracket as the Corinthian, or possibly a bit cheaper."
Jun 2016,40,June 2016 stay,"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Excellent hotel nearby the metro, and, and nearby a stop for one of the sightseeing buslines andhence close to the city The staf did a fine job but did not  look  as if they enjoyed their jobs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
Jun 2016,50,Wonderful hotel,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in.  Very convenient for the metro across the road;  easy to get into the centre of Lisbon.  Beautiful hotel with a lovely bar, outside bar area, fantastic gym and pool.  The wow factor came when I was given a locker key for the pool, and inside the locker there were 2 towels, a dressing gown, slippers and a set of toiletries.  I would love to be able to say I couldn't fault this hotel, and feel it might be a bit churlish to say that I would have liked more hooks in the bathroom;  somewhere to hang my towel in the poolside shower cubicle, and a more generous complimentary beverage tray in the room (biscuits and hot chocolate would be nice).  But other than that, absolutely wonderful."
Jun 2016,50,Fantastic,"The accommodation was superb, the Sky Lounge was an added bonus. Excellent SPA facilities.The staff were friendly, helpful and professional. The food great. A real 5star experience. Location on the Bus tours route😀"
Jun 2016,30,Good rest after a long vacation ,"We stayed at the Corinthia the last day of our visit to Portugal. It is a good idea to  reserved a executive room. The room was on the 21st floor with an excellent view.  We enjoyed the access to the executive lounge, specially because we where tired and decided not to go anywhere outside the hotel. The staff was very pleasant, and the price very reasonable.  The only thing that was kind of odd was that everything looked clean at the hotel, but the sinks at the social areas didn't, I think something should be done about it because otherwise we like the hotel. Oh and the flowers at the reception area are to die for."
Jun 2016,40,Good Business Hotel,"Attended a conference at this hotel. Reception was friendly and efficient. It is a large nice hotel a few kilometers from the city center in a business district, so there is not much happening in the streets around the hotel. However there are train and metro stations nearby which will take you to down town Lisbon or any part of the country."
Jun 2016,40,Posh As Can Be,"A high class hotel, expensively fitted out - perfect for a business event (the reason I was there). Rooms are large with everthing you will ever need.Only small complaint - no power sockets in the room. I had to raid the back of the TV and unplug the TV, certainly not where you want them by the bed. Shame they overlooked this - everything else is perfect."
Jun 2016,40,Excellent Service and Facilities,"Opted for the Executive Floor as we had used this facility at another Corinthia Hotel.  Hotel is very close to the airport and we organised a car to pick us up as a very late flight. Driver was great and the staff at check in were really good, explaining everything to us. Hotel has the amenities you would expect. Only strange thing is they want you to wear a bathing cap in the pool..If they think that helps with hygiene they are sadly mistaken! There were enough kids in the pool for other things to happen!! and plenty of hairy men. Close to shops,banks, restaurants and a metro line as well as the airport."
Jun 2016,40,Business Hotel,"I enjoyed my stay at Corinthia. It definitely had a feeling of high standards. The wifi worked properly. The only issue that I had was that it did have stains on the carpet in my room. It made it feel a little dirty, but other than that, the bed was exceptional. The bathroom was exceptional. The staff was great."
Jun 2016,50,Long weekend in Lisbon,"Great hotel, quiet, close to train and Metro, not far from airport. Very comfortable and easy. Staff is friendly and professional. A great place to relax and to enjoy thew stay in this great city.   The garden and the terace are outstanding"
Jun 2016,40,Holiday,"Really enjoyed Lisbon, the hotel has excellent position for metro, which is easy to navigate and train to Sintra is very close too. Friendly staff, comfy bed but the carpets could do with a deep clean and we have been charged £10 for a cappuccino and small orange juice, so we never drank not eaten anything else in the hotel."
Jun 2016,50,Fine business hotel,Very nice and clean rooms with friendly people Information available on request Fast access to public transportation makes it easy to organize a city trip.Small disadvantage is the regular low passage of airplanes.
Jun 2016,50,Excellent Hotel,"We visited Lisbon for 5 days and stayed in the Corinthia Hotel which provided excellent accommodation and food. Easy to walk from the hotel to the city center, use the Metro and the train. We would recommend this Hotel for anyone planning a city break in Lisbon, especially if they like walking."
Jun 2016,50,"4 night stay at the Corinthia, Lisbon","Had the pleasure of staying in an Executive Suite with access to the 24th floor, truly exceptional service and well done to the waiters and lounge staff, very friendly, polite and nothing was too much trouble - (especially Monica).Room was well proportioned and bed amazingly comfortable, the breakfast terrace area was heaven.Although the hotel was slightly out of town (5 min taxi ride) we preferred the location to city centre as we felt close enough for the city but also right on the doorstep of escaping to Sintra, CasCais and other beautiful places without having to navigate the busy streets to exit the city.Strongly suggest purchasing a 3 day Yellow Bus Explorer which includes all bus tour routes, certain tram rides, boat tour of 3-4 points along Lisbon waterfront but can also includes Sintra, and Mafra."
Jun 2016,40,Two night stay at start of a tour od Southern Portugal and Spain,Quality hotel that is oriented towards the business traveler with location close to the airport and the Metro.  Clean and modern with expected amenities.  Hotel as a very nice patio area for tapas and drinks. .
Jun 2016,20,"Beautiful Hotel, yet very uncomfortable","I was here with my girlfriend in early June, 2016. The hotel itself is very nice. It's in a decent location near a train station and subway. The breakfast is amazing and the staff was very nice. The main problem that we had at this hotel was the uncomfortable room temperature. We both woke up in the middle of the night sweating on the first night of our stay. I went to speak with the hotel staff about getting someone to our room to look at the A/C. Nothing ever occurred. The same thing happened the following evening. Also, the bathroom, which appears very nice, had no outlets for my girlfriend to plug her hairdryer or curling iron in to. She was not pleased because she had to come out into the bedroom area to take care of those things. Either way, I won't stay here again if ever in Lisbon. The hotel looks great, but it's just way too uncomfortable."
Jun 2016,50,Great Venue and Conference Facilities,The Hotel and Staff did a fantastic job at hosting 400 guests from across the world for an ISACA conference. My personal interactions with the conference team were fantastic and they did everything possible to assist Food was excellent all week and given the size of the crowd this was testament to the teams efforts
Jun 2016,40,Wonderful event,"I stayed during Hello World 2016. Friendly staff, Very good cleaning service, Nice and comfortable.Breakfast outside in the sun in the garden was lovely and my favourite part of the hotel. Realist value for money for what you get."
Jun 2016,50,Everything we wanted and more,"We stayed at the hotel based on a friend's recommendation.  We were happy with our four night stay.  The hotel is very close to the metro and a short ride downtown.  A taxi ride to the airport from the hotel was not expensive.  The room, a junior suite was fantastic.  The guest/tourist services helped us on many different subjects including lending us an attachment for our electrical devices.  The bar garden patio was perfect for a quiet drink after a busy day.  The breakfast buffet, while expensive, met our needs.  The hotel dinner restaurant was not as good given that the food was just ok,  expensive, and service could have been a lot better. The best thing that we experienced at the hotel however was when the hotel recognized my husband's birthday by delivering a good size chocolate cake and sparkling wine to our room.  The only fault we could find was the complicated (without any help) yet very secure elevator system.  Bravo to all the hotel staff."
Jun 2016,30,More 4*than5*,"If you are expecting the grandure of the Corintia in London you will be disappointed. I would describe this as a functional business hotel rather than luxurious, more 4 star than 5. The public rooms are very nice and grand but my room was rather tired. The lifts are a nightmare and I waited over 5 minutes this morning to get down from the 18th floor. I have never waited less than 1 minute. The staff are without exception excellent."
Jun 2016,50,Lisbon City Break,"We visited Lisbon for a 4 day city break and stayed in the Corinthia Hotel which provided excellent accommodation and food. Whilst the Hotel was on the outskirts of the centre it took us around 1 hour for a leisurely walk in which enabled us to see parts of the city we might have missed if we had taken the Metro or Taxi. If you feel that 1 hour is too long then the Taxi & Metro fares are around 8 euros. We opted to walk in each day and after a full day of visiting the sites we took a Taxi back to the Hotel. The rooms were spacious and comfortable and the Breakfast buffet was excellent. The Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. I would thoroughly recommend this Hotel for anyone planning a city break in Lisbon, especially if they like walking."
Jun 2016,50,Lisbon Luxury,"Quiet, fantastic transport, extremely close to city centre, great staff, extremely comfortable, super facilities and delicious cuisine. Perfect hotel for our short stay in Lisbon. And if it is something that might be of interest - Lisbon's fantastic Zoo is just across the road."
Jun 2016,40,Stag weekend in Lisbon - Great stay,"I stayed at the Corinthia for my Stag weekend with 7 friends in July 2015. The hotel was modern and relatively luxurious. The rooms are comfortable and clean and more than you need for a few night stay with friends or on a business trip. I wouldn't have stayed there with my wife or as a couple as its not exactly romantic but was perfect for what we needed. Location wise, the hotel is a 5 minute cab ride from the centre of town but cabs are very cheap in Lisbon. Breakfast outside in the sun in the garden was lovely and my favourite part of the hotel.Overall fantastic value for money for what you get."
Jun 2016,50,Wonderful weekend,Lovely hotelWonderful interiors and atmosphereGood choice of food for breakfastFriendly staffVery good cleaning serviceNice relaxing spa and swimming pollNot a perfect location to visit the city but very close to metro station
Jun 2016,30,Better Choices in Lisbon,"Stayed in the Corinthia for 2 nights and were somewhat disenchanted with our stay. The AC wasn't working properly and at night would just sweat. We did bring it up to management but nothing was done. The bathroom did not have an outlet that could a accommodate a blow dryer or curling iron. Outlet could only be used for a mans electric razor. This was a first in any hotel I have visited. Certain outlets wouldn't work once you turned out the light. So we would turn out the lights and then the phones wouldn't be charged the next morning. Breakfast was good, location is near the train station and metro but I wouldn't stay here again."
Jun 2016,50,Excellent Hotel,"What a beautiful hotel.  The foyer is amazing!  We arrived rather late and got checked in very efficiently.  We got to our room and there were Portuguese tarts waiting for us! We booked the Executive Queen Room - the room was lovely and the bed and pillows were so comfortable  and we had access to the club lounge which included breakfast, and all day snacks and drinks. The staff working in the lounge were wonderful (especially Daniel.) The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was that they required everyone to wear a swimming cap in the pool and charge you 5 euros for the privilege."
Jun 2016,50,Stayed due to missed flight,"Our airline, TAP, sent us here with a voucher after we missed our international connection. I was expecting a cheap hotel and was surprised and delighted to end up here. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly. They turned a headache into a wonderful evening in Lisbon. Thank you!"
Jun 2016,50,3 night stay,"When I arrived I thought I would be unhappy with location as area looked uninteresting. However metro on the doorstep. So public transport easy. And hotel experience was excellent. All staff from check in/out, concierge, waiters, rest manager all smiley & helpful. All staff were credit to hotel.  Flowers beautiful. Loved the elevators. All in all a very happy experience. If I return to Lisbon I would have no hesitation in booking again into the corinthia"
Jun 2016,40,"Comfortable, but under the expectancy of service for a five-star hotel.","Polited personnel, comfortable room, quite near a underground/ bus / train station. Irregular service: some people  did not act watchfully, and seemed not prepared. Part of the wardrobe was dusty, and one of the cups at the room was dirty. Differently from the Corinthia Budapest, the hotel couldn't positively surprise us anytime."
Jun 2016,50,Had a great stay,"Everything about this hotelSays comfort. My only gripe is that there was one English Channel TLC which played the same couple of shows over and over. Of course not a huge deal since we were onlyIn our room to sleep and get ready for the day, but variety would have been nice.They allowed us to check in almost 2 hours early. Room service was great, the room was comfortable and they had black out curtains; so nice."
Jun 2016,40,Great hotel at a reasonable price.,"We stayed as a family for four nights in a spacious and comfortable superior room. There were three of us and our daughter had an additional bed, despite this the room did not feel cramped. It also had great views out over Lisbon (16th floor). The hotel is not in central Lisbon but is conveniently located to the Jardim Zoologica metro station and the Sete Rios train and bus station. The Zoo is a few minutes walk away and is definitely worth a visit. The hotel itself is very comfortable and on the whole the staff were friendly and helpful. The pool is very pleasant and was not too busy when we visited. Be aware that there are changing rooms and lockers available to use but you need to ask as the staff did not volunteer the information. Also ask for instrucitions on using the lifts before you leave check in to avoid confusion as again this information is not volunteered. Breakfast is an excellent and very extensive buffet, although getting hot coffee can be a challenge.  The only disappointing thing about our stay was the meal in the hotel restaurant. They serve a buffet but we ate off the Ala carte menu. The main courses were nice and my daughter's dessert was excellent but the trio of Portuguese desserts that I had was poor quality and even poorer value for money. The main issue however was the service. The staff were clearly geared up for people using the buffet and the waits for food were too long for both main and dessert and getting plates cleared was an uphill struggle. This is a pity as it does not reflect the level of service in the rest of the hotel. Overall this is a lovely hotel and we would stay again but we wouldn't eat in the restaurant."
Jun 2016,50,Weekend as king and queen,"Everything was excellent!kindness,professionality and a beautiful place completed a perfect stay and a perfect weekend. Executive club is really cool and confortable,very good food,drinks and the view from 24 floor!"
Jun 2016,50,Easy and non intrusive,10/10. Staff were attentive yet non intrusive. Pool was excellent-clean and pH was perfect. The charge for the swimming pool bathing cap we thought was excessive and unnecessary considering the cost of the accommodation. Overall a very pleasant experience.thanks.
Jun 2016,50,Good hotel & well situated!,The hotel might not be in the old city center but you can very easily go there by underground. Just 5 min away is metro station and you can be in the old town in just 10 - 15 min. Dayly ticket is app. 6 €.The hotel is modern and quite high tech with elevators taking you to your floor just by sweeping the card. I was lucky having a great view over the city from the room. Rooms are not too big but very clean and with good wi-fi.The breakfast buffet is nice with fresh coffee served on the table and freshly prepared omeletts.
Jun 2016,40,Enjoyed Stay,"The hotel is quite comfortable, well located, and the staff is quite friendly and helpful! Breakfast was nice with quite a few options. Enjoyed live music in the evenings! Close to metro and train stations."
Jun 2016,40,Highly Recommended,"Great location for access across the city. Two regrets, having to wait longer for my massage. Time is essential especially when you have a dinner date to follow. Waiter not sure what comes with fish dish. Cannot fault the ambience on arrival, efficient and friendly check-in and housekeeping attention to detail."
Jun 2016,40,Corinthia Hotel Lisbon,"Large, fairly modern hotel about 15 minute ride from the airport, approx 15 Euro taxi fare. Reception staff first class and very helpful. Great terrace bar to enjoy long, hot evenings and this week the young guy playing the organ was brilliant. Lots of classic rock played really well and at a volume where you could choose to listen or tune out and carry on a conversation.Bedroom I was in was spacious and well lit. WiFi free and fast. Buffet breakfast selection very good. I checked out before breakfast on second day but they had a really good selection of hot drinks and snacks you could access if you were leaving early. You don't often see this and when you do it tends to be the bear minimum, The Corinthia selection was a cut above what i have seen elsewhere. Dinner offerings were reasonable although i couldn't see beyond the great prawns they offered. Also had a comprehensive buffet selection for dinner but I did not use this. Food and beverage prices reasonable for a hotel.Look forward to visiting again."
Jun 2016,40,NICE HOTEL,We decided to book a 4 night stay in an Executive Room in the Corinthia Hotel in Lisbon as we had a wonderful experience in the Corinthia Hotel in Budapest.     Our booking- in experience was quite different in Lisbon which was conducted in the foyer not in the Executive Lounge - no welcome drink offered although there were drinks on the table.    The reception and guest services staff were helpful but struggled to raise a smile.    Our room was spacious and in general very good but there were cuts & tears in the wallpaper from suitcases and the tiles in the bathroom round the toilet area were marked.   These are little things but in my mind this is the type of detail which make it 4 not a 5 star Hotel.    The Executive lounge was excellent with delicious canapés etc and drinks also the staff were helpful in particular Monica who took the time to answer our questions.    Breakfast was very good in the Executive Lounge but I felt there was more choice for breakfast in the restaurant downstairs.    We ate in the Tipico restaurant in the hotel only once as we felt it was overpriced for average food.We felt the location of the hotel was good but it is outwith the centre of Lisbon which is quieter and depends on what each individual is looking for.    There is a Metro station nearby and it is only a few stops without changing to get into the centre.    Also there is an abundance of taxis always available at the Hotel entrance and not too expensive.  With the Hotel being out-with the centre of Lisbon we felt we did not use the Executive Lounge to its full potential.
Jun 2016,50,4 Night Stay in Portugal,"A wonderful trip to Portugal where we found everybody we met friendly. Our stay at the Corinthia Hotel was very impressive with our accommodation being spacious and spotlessly clean. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and every facility worked as it should. We have traveled throughout the world extensively and this is up there at the top. Rui and Daniel were ever attentive and helpful and are such a credit to this hotel and all the other staff were also friendly and approachable. Access to buses, airport and metro also a great combination.  Many of Lisbon's attractions are also within walking distance."
Jun 2016,40,Great Hotel with very friendly staff,"Great hotel. Staff were friendly. Our room was good but the curtains has a tear a couple of inches in length so some sunlight was able to come through. This wasn't a big issue and we certainly didn't complain but it would be nice if maintenance was a little more thorough in checking the facilities. Corinthia is close to the Zoo and Sete Rios where you can get the Metro, Train or bus to go all over Lisbon - very handy given that the hotel is a little bit away from the center of town. Overall, a highly enjoyable stay and i would definately recommend this to other people."
Jun 2016,40,Excellent Concierge!,"The concierge at this hotel is outstanding!  Everyone goes out of their way to be of assistance and this type of customer service is so hard to find that it deserves recognition.  I gave the hotel four stars because the restaurant,Tipico was not good and the rooms were lacking in outlets as well as storage space. We had to put toiletry bags on the bathroom floor to lack of counter space or shelving.The breakfast buffet was good!"
Jun 2016,40,Good Business hotel,"Service, comfort and food are all excellent but what lets it down is its location which is less than glamorous but convenient if you are on business and visiting banks. The one in London is a different class altogether. Good value for money though."
Jun 2016,50,Room equipped with every comfort,"we do not know the quality / price since the room was assigned to us by the airline due to a missed connection and CONSEQUENTIAL additional night in Lisbon.In any cas the hotel is really nice, very professional and friendly staff,, speaks perfect English and even Italian. The room is very large, elegant, equipped with every comfort. We were also given a spuntin room at midnight, maybe required by the airline. I'm not used to big luxury hotel, but I think the hotel is suitable for people looking for this kind"
Jun 2016,50,5 night trip to Lisbon,"Just returned from a wonderful trip to Portugal where we found everybody we met friendly and open.  Our stay at the Corinthia Hotel was very impressive with our accommodation being spacious and spotlessly clean.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable and every facility worked as it should.  We have travelled throughout the world extensively and this is up there at the top.  Our package included access to the 24th Floor Executive Lounge with its magnificent views, and this was an important highlight for us.  Monica and Daniel were ever attentive and helpful and are such a credit to this hotel and all the other staff were also friendly and approachable.  We will be telling friends and family to make this a must - access to buses and metro also a winning combination."
Jun 2016,40,"Pretty new hotel with all amenities, close to the aurport","We were there for a business conference and the hotel functioned very well for that. It has many meeting rooms of different sizes, also ball rooms for larger gatherings. A nice bar and good restaurant as well.The location is convenient regarding airport access, 15 minuyes approximately with no traffic.For tourist though I would select a hotel closer to the old city pr downtown. Lisbong is a lovely city but this hotel is not in that part of town. Actually, the re is ""nothing"" around it so pretty boring for evening strolls."
Jun 2016,40,Good Location,"This is a nice hotel in a good location--walking distance to the zoo, a metro station, the bus line, and several ATM machines. The rooms are a good size and the beds comfortable. The only problem with the room is a lack of an electrical plug in the bathroom which is able to handle hair dryers (provided) or other hair appliances. And, the plugs outside the bathroom are not conveniently located near a mirror. I stood outside the bathroom door and looked into the mirror through the open door--not such a good option if your eyesight is poor. The breakfast in the hotel is varied and very good, and the breakfast room huge. Many business travelers stay here, and conferences are frequently held in the hotel. To avoid the huge influx of guests at breakfast, either come just as it opens at 7 am or after 8 when things begin to thin out. It can be hard to get coffee refills at the peak times. We would definitely stay here again and staff were great."
Jun 2016,50,Great Hotel,"Stayed 4 nights for a vacation trip with my wife. Hotel is first class at a very reasonable price. Even so, its not located in the city center, there is a metro station 1 block away and it only takes 15 min to travel to the main tourist places. There are also a couple of nice little restaurants nearby worth trying."
May 2016,50,Lovely hotel in Lisbon,"We enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia very much. The room was very well appointed with a spacious, luxurious bathroom. The staff was friendly and helpful. It was near the airport, but not far from downtown."
May 2016,40,Lisbon for business,"Great hotel, good breakfast buffet and very warm and welcoming service.Clean and nice. Very nice experience indeed. One less attractive is the hotel location which is a bit outside the Lisbon city center....However there is a metro station just around the corner..."
May 2016,50,Fabulous Lisbon Hotel Experience,"Lovely hotel with a lovely pool area. It is slightly less luxiourious than its London equivalent but nevertheless a gorgeous hotel. Unlike the London hotel the spa was not included in the price but it was only an additional 20 Euros for 2 hours. The location is out of town but the Metro was just round the corner. All in all it was a lovely, relaxing and luxiourious place to stay in Lisbon."
May 2016,50,Excellent,"Very nice place to stay. I was there for business and leisure. The personell is very kind. Meeting rooms well conceived. Breakfast and dinners outstanding. The hotel also offers spa and pool, but unfortunately I didn't find time to visit them. They look gorgeous. Nice music in the evening. The location is just a few meters away from the underground station. So this is the perfect choice  if you want to visit the city after your day at work. Thank you"
May 2016,50,Good Hotel Experience,"I think overall the hotel experience impressed me.Hotel staff are very friendly and make me feel very welcome.Room is clean and good value.The only suggestion is the lifts are a bit slow. It is high tech, but slow unfortunately."
May 2016,40,"When there are problems, they solve","Our stay was not perfect: almost one hour to check in, difficulties  to prepare a tea in the room, to connect cables... But the staff was always helpful and trying hard to solve the issues. Breakfast is good, location is ok if you are interested in zoo, but also easy to go around by cab or subway."
May 2016,50,Best in Lisbon?,"Excellent hotel, staff and food.  Quite close to the Metro so easy to go into the centre from the hotel.  Largely a business district but looks safe.  Spa facilities perhaps second to none.  Certainly this is the hotel to visit if you have the money, not cheap but quality does come at a price generally"
May 2016,50,Lovely hotel in the business/residential area,"Perfect hotel for our stay in Lisbon to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Thank you for the extra special touches to make our stay memorable. Service from check in to check out was always efficient and friendly. Rooms were comfortable and well equiped. Lovely terraced area at the back to enjoy the sun, with a large screen tv. Good gym and although pool is indoors they have beds outside if you want to sunbathe.The location is a good walk out of the lovely historic centre of Lisbon, however the transport links to there and elsewhere are good. We caught the airport bus to the hotel €3.50 each way, and a taxi back which came to about €9. Locally there are good restaurants , non of which are overly expensive and are full of locals rather than tourists. Overall a lovely hotel ."
May 2016,50,Hospitality Perfection,"I have 'waxed lyrical' so many times regarding this hotel on Trip Advisor, to family and friends etc., I am running out of superlatives to describe such an excellent establishment. I have always believed the management and staff truly reflect the quality of any hotel and the Corinthia Lisbon has a superb team, do not take just my word how many 5 star hotels on TA have over 4000 reviews and are rated four and half in an overall customer rating!"
May 2016,40,"Good Hotel Off the Beaten Path, RIght Near the Metro","Enjoyed staying at the Corinthia for 4 nights.  The breakfast buffet was great, and the bar service superb.  The check in experience was great if you have VIP status, not so much if you arrive when everyone else does.  The concierge was very helpful.  Overall a very good experience in Lisbon."
May 2016,50,Luxury,"We were just looking for an overnight stay close to the bus and train station but ended up thoroughly enjoying our brief stay at this luxurious hotel. Our room was very spacious, and equipped with everything one would hope for. We opted to include the buffet breakfast and overall felt we'd had value for money. The staff at check in and check out  were efficient and very friendly. The location is too far from most Lisbon attractions but it's a perfect spot for those travelling onward by bus or train from Sete Rios."
May 2016,50,Excellent place for a relaxing vacation,"There was not a single detail to complain about the hotel and its employees. If someone is planning a second honeymoon Corinthia is the place.porters, front desk personnel were all ready to answer all queries. Furthermore they would recommend transportation to get faster and safer to places."
May 2016,40,Beautiful Hotel in superb location,My husband and I choose to stay here while visiting Portugal to see Adele perform. The hotel was in an ideal spot for the metro and the train station. It was spotlessly clean and the staff were wonderful. The beds were very comfy and there was a lovely view of the gardens from our room. Breakfast was excellent. Especially the fresh fruit and the freshly made omlettetes.  We didn't eat in the restaurant at night so we can't comment on that aspect. I would have given this hotel a 5 but as in all big hotels the drinks were very expensive.  13 .50 euros for a small white wine and small beer. A little excessive if you want to while away a sunny afternoon in the lovely terrace and gardens.
May 2016,50,Truly a 5 star experience. Best hotel stay in 19 days in all of Portugal.,"From our arrival to our departure after 4 days, everything was perfect. We spent 3 weeks travelling throughout Portugal and spent many nights in other hotels rated as 5 star hotels. This was our last hotel stay in Portugal.The Corinthia management team has the magic formula as all staff are well trained and accommodating and the hotel is run in an efficient yet friendly fashion. Our room was immaculately cleaned, beautifully decorated and the bed was the most comfortable we slept on in 19 days in Portugal. The Executive Lounge served a fantastic breakfast with a chef preparing eggs in any manner you would want. The assortments of breads, fruits, charcuterie and cheeses was superb, and of the highest quality. Their was yogurt and cereals available as well.Every staff member we encountered took the extra step to make our stay memorable.I cannot say enough about this hotel and rate it 5 out of 5 stars."
May 2016,40,"Old outfit, well updated, easy to reach Downtown & Sintra","this hotel had 4 stars hm, very well equiped gym. boring conference buffet,direkt in airplain direction to airport. good windows , but don t open the window @your room. Service ok. Breakfast well stuffed and served.10 mins to airport. 3 mins to metro"
May 2016,50,Excellent. Extremely good.,"Outstanding high quality. Excellent staff. As executive guest everything was way better than good. Most the staff definitely loved their work and were pleasant and enthusiastic in all matters. A special thank you to everyone at the Executive Club Sky Lounge and the doorman ""Miguel"". It was a pure delight to be served at Corinthia. HIGH QUALITY all over in the reception hall, decorations, sitting interior, sun terrace, swimmingpool, restaurant, lifts, interiors all over, suite/room. If possible - this hotel should have 6 stars."
May 2016,50,Excellent hotel!!!,"This hotel is fantastic value for money. Staff are very helpful and very friendly.  The metro station is located approximately 250 metres away which has excellent links to all over Lisbon.  Our suite was very spacious with slippers, robes, great selection of toiletries etc, well stocked mini bar and snacks provided. Will definitely be returning later in the year."
May 2016,50,Not far from perfection,"The Hotel is 15min away from the airport by car. It's in the business area of the city of Lisboa so forget about the nice surroundings (only buidlings). The hotel, entrance reception are very nice, same for the bedrooms and we had the chance to have the view on the city, river, bridge and the statut of the Christ even if we were only at the 11th floor. I do recommand to go to the lounge bar on the 24th floor, in the evening the atmosphere and view are just wonderfull, but you have to pay to have access because you can eat and drink as you wish.The staff was extremely good with us (caring), at the restaurant, the lounge and reception even if French is not that easy for them, english is not a problem. The Hotel is near the city zoo which is appalling sorry to say and 5min walk from the subway and bus stations, good point if you want to visit Lisboa the Metro (4 lines lol) is clean never late and rarely crowded. Last thing every day they put a chocolate on your pillow which is so good we were almost fighting for ....Thank you so much for everything  I can't wait to come back to your hotel and Lisboa."
May 2016,30,Hospitable staff???,"Stayed three nights in the Junior suite and had an average experience. Before arrival I had contact with the Reservations manager and the provided service was excellent. However upon arrival they did not had any twin bedded junior suites available and I accepted to share a king size bed with my friend. The junior suite is just average, nothing special. Concierge desk was often not manned. Breakfast was average. SPA was closed without any notice from the hotel, the spa reception said it was closed for maintenance like it is very normal. Staff does not seem to understand the word hospitality. The provided service is not what you will expect from a 5 star hotel. Will I stay here again? Not sure..."
May 2016,50,awesome hotel,I have stayed here several times and am never disappointed. The metro is easy to get to the airport and is very close. Also first class service and accommodation! Love this hotel! Can't say enough good things about this wonderful hotel!
May 2016,40,A nice hotel,This hotel was very nice. The breakfast was very food with a good choice and very good service. Also the service on the terraxe lounge was very good however found pricing to be too high. The pool side we did not like and we had to buy swimming hat. This should have been included on price. Will certainly recommend this hote. Also close to metro station.
May 2016,50,Top Shelf Facility,"Quality facility with service focused staff.  One of the best experiences of any facility in Europe.  Close to train and the metro. Chose package with access to the executive lounge, great value. Will stay any time I am in Lisbon."
May 2016,10,Overall just a badly organised hotel,"So when I checked in they asked to secure a certain amount for the room and the bar. I asked to pay the full amount of the stay in advance, and to avoid the security charge for the mini bar I asked for this to be removed. When it actually came to it, they secured the amount of my stay, and then did not charge that balance but charged me again. This meant that I had to contact the hotel, and I am still waiting for them to ""release"" this balance back into my account.  Furthermore, to get to your floor you need to use your card, which could have been explained to me at check in. Once I got to the lifts my card was not working. After the long wait for check in as it is, I had to go back, wait and get them to redo my key card.The hotel is also based quite far out from the city centre."
May 2016,40,Nice Hotel,"A lovely decorated hotel, all the staff seemed nice, the beds were very comfy and the hotel restaurant/ bar areas are really lovely too. Before we arrived I emailed them to let them know we were travelling for my boyfriends 30th birthday so when we arrived they had put a bottle of the Portuguese equivalent to Prosecco and a cake in our room which was a really nice touch. The location of the hotel is fine, a little out of the centre but right across from a metro stop so it only took 10 minutes and you were right in the middle of Lisbon. Although this hotel is lovely, I was a little disappointed that the glasses left in our room were really dirty. If you are wanting to be right in the middle of Lisbon this hotel isn't for you, but if you want to be able to escape the hustle and bustle right in the centre it is perfect."
May 2016,50,Girly Holiday,"HIGHLY recommend this hotel to both groups of girls or indeed couples. Fabulous interior, clean, modern, classy. Access to the executive lounge is a must and well worth it. Great location with metro station across the road and only two stops away from the main city centre. Staff so friendly and warm to us, especially Daniel and Monica. Will 100% be returning in the near future."
May 2016,40,"Nice property, but there are better locations if you're visiting for leisure","The hotel covers the basic expectations to a high quality - friendly staff, very clean, good gym, comfortable bed.The location is ok if you're purely there for business, the metro is a short walk away and there's always taxis outside and it's close (under the flight path although not noisy) for the airport. If you're in Lisbon for leisure though, it's some distance from the main tourist attraction and ambience of the old town district.A tech problem with the check in system caused a really lengthy delay when we arrived - I wouldn't expect this to be a regular issue, but it would have been nice to have been simply given the keys to our room (the key system was fine and our room ready and allocated) and to complete some of the final points later. Breakfast in the main cafe area was pleasant and pretty standard other than we arrived at the last hour of it being served and most of the hot buffet was finished and wasn't replaced which was disappointing. Overall, I think it's ok value and you'll generally be happy staying at the Corinthia if you don't have the minor niggles we did."
May 2016,20,Poor Service,Understaffed and poorly trained management.  Food and beverage manager mishandled our complaints and showed little desire to correct issues.  I am cancelling 3 rooms for upcoming Corinhia stay in London because of our experience in Lisbon.
May 2016,50,Excellent,"Stayed here for a trip to see Adele, saw the reviews and booked via booking.com.We decided to go for the executive room with access to the executive lounge, so glad we did. The service was impeccable and the staff were just amazing.The rooms are very spacious and well equipped with an excellent wifi signal. The beds are huge and very soft for a great nights sleep. The living room had a big to with lots of international channels, settee and lots of space! Room service was quick and efficient and quite tasty! Breakfast was served in the executive club lounge and had a selection for everyone!Metro is 250 metres from the hotel and you are in the centre in 10 minutes! Exit via the train station it is quicker! Will definitely be returning again to try the spa and pool!"
May 2016,40,"Great hotel,  not much on tv","Smart,  clean,  friendly,  close {2 mins} to metro, nice modern rooms. Fairly quiet area, ok nearby restaurants. Tv in hotel has a lot of channels unfortunately just showing the whole world's news channels so nothing to watch when chilling"
May 2016,50,Corinthia review,Once again I have returned seeing as the service and quality have yet to be matched in my book. I have held numerous events here and the ease at which it they meet my requests and deliver on quality and price is key to me choosing them. I will return for sure and also for private as the spa and comfort makes this hotel stand out from the others. Their staff is a real tribute to their success I am sure!
May 2016,40,Highly recommended,Beautiful hotel with great facilities. Lovely relaxing stay and would definitely recommend this hotel if you want to stay somewhere special and be pampered.  9 out of 10. Thanks for a lovely stay. Siobhan 23.05.2016
May 2016,50,Fantastic Hotel in Lisbon,"I can find no faults with this hotel, it is a short walk from the metro about 250 meters, exit via the train station signs it is quicker. Checkin was very easy, we were booked into an executive suite but didn't know there was a seperate checkin.The room was very big and very smart, clean and modern. They actually have a turn down service so came in the evening while we were out to put chocolates on our pillows and tidy up.The executive lounge is very good with free drinks and snacks but didn't have time to make use of this really, as only there for a couple of days! Breakfast was excellent something for everyone.Had room service and was also very good, and quick.Wifi works perfectly and even allowed me to stream the football so no complaints there.The shower was probably the best I have experienced in a hotel, so powerful and constant temperature.Overall I cannot fault this hotel and will definitely return."
May 2016,50,Always a great stay...perfect service,"As you can see by my previous reviews, we stay here often and cannot fault the hotel and it's wonderful attentive and friendly staff. As always, we were looked after from the moment we arrived. Greeted by Roque the doorman and checked in by Marta on the Executive Club check-in.  She is always happy and smiling and makes our stay.  The room was again, in perfect order. Housekeeping are wonderful and very through and always know what you need. Each day all aspects are attended too and promptly. Even when I used the spa and pool my robe was wet, so the housekeeper replaced it along with my wet slippers.  Sandra who managed the executive club on 24th floor is always ready to greet her guests and her team are excellent. Daniel who basically runs the floor at breakfast single handedly has all your needs catered for and is ready with your favourites before you have to ask.  Always remembers my preferences. Signs of great customer service. Always exceeds expectations. Staff here are the best. It makes the hotel and any other (minor) issues if any can be forgotten because they all are very helpful and professional. The new General Manager Roderick must be proud to take on such a fantastic team. Lillia, Monica, Ana 1 and 2, Margarida, Joanna, Rute, Ines, Valter, Constantine, Marta, Domingos, Roque and all the staff who I hope forgive me for not mentioning by name: offer superb service. Thanks to you all.  The Corinthia Hotel is nicely situated just outside the main centre of Lisbon, perfect restpite after a long hot day sightseeing.  The spa and pool can't be missed. Relaxing and well managed.  Metro close by and bus service outside hotel to centre and beyond. Train station direct to Sintra in 35 mins. Try and upgrade to the executive rooms which come with access to the Skylounge on 24th floor with great views, service, snacks, drinks all day.  A pleasant rest with a beer or cuppa and a great start to the day with breakfast in abundance: something for everyone. Of course. We will be back soon and hope you all have a pleasant summer. Also other must haves: Free Wifi in all rooms. 24h Room Service.  Security & Guest Services 24h. Robes and Slippers. Hairdryer. Water refreshed each day. Tea and Coffee facilities in rooms with Nespresso Machine and supply of pods. Oh! And a turn down service in the evening with fresh towels and of course a chocolate on your pillow. Goodnight zz"
May 2016,50,Very luxery Business Hotel,"This time I was there for a three day convention and it was really well organized and executed. The Hotel was easy to reach from the airport and had a pretty central location in the middle of the city, not downtown but centrally located. Welcome service was busy due to 400 participants but managed very well and friendly. rooms are very clean and convenient. Free water and all the necessities of a luxury hotel. Only the TV selection was a bit strange in my eyes offering minor German channels, and not the major channels? I did not sleep best since my room was to the main roads not of sound more of light! On the other side right across was a fantastic fish restaurant and the made it worth having the street side! All in all a god stay for a conference, I did not see much of the city but have been there before, so all good and worth to come back for a business conference!"
May 2016,30,"Not ""5-star"" as its website indicates...","I have previously been to Lisbon for business and sought to book a hotel at good value so that my wife and I could now enjoy the city for 5 days/4 nights as tourists.  Primary reason for booking this hotel was to take advantage of their promotion which discounted the daily rate by 50%. The Corinthia is close to the airport but its website offers no tips for how to get there using bus or metro; it also mentions the many benefits the location provides as a meetings facility and offers general tips about what you can enjoy seeing in Lisbon without mentioning how much time you need to commute to all those places.Best part of the hotel is its proximity to the Sete Rios train station (providing direct access for day trips to Sintra and Cascais) and the Blue metro line (15-20 minute ride to city center).  Room itself was fine. 16th floor.  Nice view overlooking the aqueduct.We opted out of the daily breakfast - 18 euro/person at check-in; 20 euro otherwise. When in Europe, do as the locals do... pastry and beverage.  We did opt in for breakfast on our last morning there... good variety of hot and cold food.  Omelettes to order.  But, still not worth 18-20 euro/person.Check-in and check-out was efficient.  Maintenance, bellhop and housekeeping were especially accommodating.  The staff, however, at Guest Services were not helpful at all.  Seriously, hotel management should consider replacing all of them with a self-service app on the TV menu... We were really in the hotel long enough to get a good night of sleep each evening.  Room was comfortable and the daily replenishment of complimentary bottled water was a nice touch.  Overall, we would not consider staying here again if visiting Lisbon for leisure.Stayed May 2016, traveled as a couple"
May 2016,50,Excellent stay,"Excellent hotel, slightly out of Lisbon with easy access to all transport links.  The hotel is only 10 minutes from the airport and is on the flight path for the planes, however this is not a problem, you cannot hear the planes inside the hotel. The hotel staff are helpful and pleasant and nothing is too much trouble."
May 2016,50,Excellent hotel in a convenient location,We stayed for one night because the hotel is located very close to the Sete Rios bus and train stations. It is an excellent modern hotel with large rooms and first class amenities. It was very comfortable. A minor inconvenience was that you could not use the hair drier in the bathroom and no power plug near a mirror
May 2016,50,The best service ever !,"During our citytrip to Lisbon we were staying in the Corinthia hotel with the executive club services included. Very kind and helpfull staff, excellent facilities at the executive club lounge where we enjoyed our breakfast and snacks during our breaks. Nice view on the Taag and the welcoming atmosphere rather than a busy restaurant was very relaxing. The executive club services is a must do ! Also right next to a train and metro station to get to Lisbon city centre easily."
May 2016,50,Great hotel!,I stayed at Corinthia Hotel for four nights and I can really recommend this hotel. Our room was really nice with comforture beds and a big bathroom. The room had a nespresso machin and we got free chocolate every night by the cleaning lady who stopped by to see if we needed anything extra. The breakfast was really good and offered everything from omletts to waffles to bread and yoghurt. We also tested the pool one afternoon and this is probebly the only thing that I was a bit disappointed since the SPA was not included and the pool was just a normal swiming pool. The location of the hotel is not in the city center of Lisbon but right outside the hotel is a metro station who will take you to the city center in 15 min. Worked really good!
May 2016,50,friendly,All the staff we had contact with were always cheerful and helpful. They gave us good advice about our trips out and what to eat and their wine recommendations were always spot on. Their English was excellent and they all appeared to enjoy speaking this language.
May 2016,50,great stay,the corinthia provided everything you would expect in a 1st class hotel.location great. able to book a sightseeing trip of lisbon from staff in the lobby who were very helpful. great 1st time trip to lisbon corinthia thanks
May 2016,50,Excellent all-round stay,"Amazing array of choice at breakfast. The room was comfortable, especially the bed. Great views of the 25 of April Bridge. Easy walk to the metro, bus terminus and railway station. 10-15 mins by metro to the heart of Lisbon. This hotel lies in an interesting part of north Lisbon a short distance away from the main buzz."
May 2016,40,Corinthia Hotel Lisbon,"Hotel is quite conveniently located, not too far from most attractions of Lisbon. Rooms are comfortable and reasonably spacious. The great thing is that they have smoking rooms, which has become a rarity these days. Service is good, but nothing super. Breakfast is quite rich with a wide variety"
May 2016,30,good value hotel,"Stayed at the hotel for a week with my partner and friends, the hotel was a little way out of the centre but was clean and the bedrooms were more than adequate,  lots of wardrobe and drawer space, nice balcony with fabulous views over the harbour, only fault was a little noisy as rooms overlook a main road.breakfast was plentiful and lots of choice, with great coffee. Was early in the season so not all facilities available, eg pool bar, sunbeds and food at lunchtime, which was a little disappointing as the weather was glorious."
May 2016,40,Good hotel shame about the weather,"Arrived at the hotel, greeted by the doorman. Our rooms were not ready so we went into the bar for a drink and some lunch.  Service although a little slow was good and so was the food.  Our rooms were ok, I was on the 6th floor however there was a leak from the window which was going on the carpet one of housekeeping arrived to put a towel on the window ledge.  If you look at the windows the black seal was misplaced so is not a quick fix.We left the hotel by taxi and went to the old town but due to the weather we could not be out too long.As we had been up so early we decided to eat in the hotel that night as we were told of another restaurant and thought we could go there the following night.We selected the buffet option which was very good however the young chef needs to interact with the guests better.  The waiting staff were good and do was the good selection.We retired to the bar after so a good day overall.The following day we breakfasted and the omelette was very tasty, however I would say that the leather seating area needs to be cleaned as they were dirty.We then spent a day wandering and seeing the sights, ending up at the beer museum.When we returned we asked about the restaurant which a member of staff had told us about to be told they shut on Sundays, as it was raining again we could not just wander to find a restaurant suitable for all tastes so we ate in the restaurant again.Once again the food was really good.The spa area was nice but you need a swimming hat which are charged at 5 euros if you wish to use the pool.Overall the hotel was good and the chocolates the staff hand out are lovely it was the weather which dampened our stay."
May 2016,40,"Clean, efficient, helpful","Good value for money. Convenient access to Kulbikian museum and metro. Only complaint is that hotel wouldn't allow late check out. Otherwise, it was a pleasant place to stay to visit Lisbon and the area."
May 2016,40,Hotel staff very helpful and plesent ...rooms tasteful furnished with wonderful views,Service was excellent ..location and spar and swimming pool was good...Room Service and breakfast was excellentLobby was spacious and outdoor area was great for relaxing and having a drinkTook a little while to get used to using the lifts system
May 2016,40,4 days in Lisboa,"We enjoyed our stay at this luxury hotel that is located close to the tube station ""Jardim Zoologico"" from where you can easily get to all the sights. Rooms were clean and comfy. The only down side was the quality of the hairdryer and the trouble we had to connect it to the electric wall plug. The cord being to short to get to a mirror. No wall plug in the bathroom (which is a safety matter) and no mirror close to the electric wall plug. Of course we could have asked for a extension cable but the point is that this should not happen in a luxury hotel."
May 2016,40,Very Efficient,Very nice hotel. Offers a nice lobby and bar. Rooms are good but small. out sid cafes in hotel do not  operate. Hotel is with nice 2 entrances. nice and new elevator system. They slow down air condition . I t means you may feel hot  while you are in the room.
May 2016,40,Quiet hotel with big comfortable rooms!,"This was one of the hotel I stayed with my wife for 5 nights as I have a conference in the hotel. Checked in was good. The room is in excellent condition except for the bathroom which I find it can be improved further. Internet WiFi is fast. The buffet spread is quite good and same goes to the in-room dining. Security was quite tight, probably because we have a conference there so we felt safe staying there. There is a supermarket and few restaurants nearby in case you need to stock up your fridge or prefer to eat outside. Metro subway is nearby if you wanted to head elsewhere.Overall, a good hotel for business traveler or a group of families."
May 2016,50,Hotel Corinthia,"Whilst the hotel is a reasonable distance from the tourist are of Lisbon, it is well served by a nearby Metro system, which gets you to the heart of the `action` in a few minutes. The hotel has great facilities and all staff are very approachable and helpful. We only ate the inclusive breakfast, which was excellent."
May 2016,40,A pleasant stay,"We stayed here whilst attending a conference. Great hotel but out of the tourist district alhough close to the metro. Easy access into the city and tourist sites, only 10 - 15  by metro.Amazingly comfortable bed with great views over the aquaduct towards the city. This is a busy hotel and seems to cater mostly to conventions/conferences.Conference facilities were adequate but the conference room was a little 'tired'. Late checkout was appreciated."
May 2016,40,Nice hotel in Lisbon,"My first trip to Lisbon has become more pleasant with my stay in Corinthia Hotel. Booking was easy and hotel staff were courteous. The room was nice and cozy. We were able to get a good night sleep. The food, however, needs some more variety especially for guests staying for more than 3 nights. The rates are reasonable and the WiFi inside the room was great."
May 2016,50,"Excellent property, good security, nice staff","This is a sleek, modern hotel and has touches I have never seen in other properties.There is lots of security.  Your key card for the elevator allows you only to go to your floor.  You need it to go both up and to return to the lobby.  There is a bit of a learning curve to use it, but make sure that the key works before you go to your room.  For three of us, the keys did not work.    The television menu is a pictograph and it is very easy to find the stations you want including CNN and BBC.I had room 2018 which was pretty standard.  There was a connecting door to the corner room, but it was locked. The one advantage of this room is that it was high enough to enjoy the lights of the city. It looked toward the aquaduct.  Another person in our group had 2005 which was spectacular - large, with a sitting area, large windows and a king size bed.Water pressure in the shower was about the best I’ve had anyplace.  Wi-fi was excellent - fast, stable and free.  Bathroom amenities are ESPA brand.  The rooms are serviced twice a day (might have to request) and they leave chocolates.We had the dinner buffet in the lobby  restaurant and it is excellent with lots of salads, fish, seafood and meats.Two things to be aware of:to turn the music off in the bathroom, there is a dial across from the toiletseveral electrical outlets are under  a panel on the top of the desk.  I found having my own extension cord helpfulI return to this hotel at the end of my tour, and am looking forward to it."
May 2016,40,Very comfortable ,"What a lovely hotel to relax and unwind in. Rooms are tasteful, bar is well stocked and the spa and pool areas are a real oasis. I felt it was a little bit to far from the city center for my liking around 5 miles but if you stayed here you would really feel pampered and you could always get a taxi if you don't want a walk into the center. In fact I would say that is the best thing to do. The hotel has a mix of sightseers and Buisness people. So it caters for everyone. I didn't eat here as I like to eat out in good local restaurants which there are a few near the hotel. So I can't review the food on a whole but the breakfasts are really good."
May 2016,40,Very nice.,"Very nice hotel.Shorts to walk to the metro.Nice staff.Very, very good breakfast.Short to walk to the zoo and to Benfica stadium.Quiet place.Liked the outside terrasse.Roomservice was quick, and the good nice."
May 2016,40,"Typical convention hotel, but good rooms","We stayed here for two nights in connection with a convention. We very favorably noted the generous early check in and also the size of the rooms, which are well equipped with comfortable beds and a desk.Breakfast was extremely busy and therefore noisy, but this may be due to the fact that the hotel was close to fully booked. Quality of food and variety was good, however, and also coffee service was friendly and quick.Reception showed some deficiencies (quick check-out form had never been processed, English language skill was insufficient, check in procedure was also slow).Hotel is a bit away from the city center, but a Metro station is very close to it (Zoological garden).Overall, a good business hotel."
May 2016,50,Get the bridge view,Get the view of the bridges aqueduct if possible.  Dinner buffet 30 but worth it - salmon was very tasty.  Short walk to fun zoo /  SEE DOLPHIN SHOW!  Executive floors come with great breakfast and snacks through the day.  Great service all around.
May 2016,50,Very pleasant stay at Corinthia Hotel,"Loved this hotel and would gladly return should I come back to Lisbon! Staff was very nice, good location (close to Metro) even though no walking distance to the main tourist places. Clean, great service, gorgeous reception/lounge. A luxorious feeling overall!"
May 2016,50,Short break,"From the moment we booked our 2 night stay the staff were brilliant. They were all so helpful and friendly. Hotel was lovely, near to the metro and cabs always available so easy access to the hotspots!"
May 2016,50,Very Nice,Very modern and clean with excellent beds. Our room was very spacious and the view from our room was excellent and the restaurant suggestions from the staff were spot on.   Only a shirt drive to the airport by taxi.
May 2016,30,"Nice location, overall good stay","The location was nice, on the metro line and easily accessible. 10 mins to the downtown area. The bed was exquisite, the room was average. On two separate occasions throughout our 6 night stay our room keys stopped working and needed to be re-activated at the front desk. On one occasion the desk we busy with late night check-ins and the clerk wouldnt speak to us unless we waiting in the huge line. Also, 18 euros a day per person for breakfast is outrageous. We didn't eat at the hotel even once. There is a great cafe down the street that does a nice breakfast on your walk to the metro. Super friendly staff and very inexpensive.Overall, our experience with Hotel Corinthia Lisbon was positive."
May 2016,50,The Best,"Without doubt an excellent hotel. We stayed for 4 nights on a city break. Not one fault. A  complimentary birthday cake and Sparkling Wine were left in the room as a surprise. The Executive Lounge is very well run and offers excellence of service few hotels will match. If you are staying in Lisbon you must stay here, trust me you won't regret it. We stayed in a junior suite with Executive Lounge access."
May 2016,50,Superb,"Visited the Corinthia Hotel for my boyfriends 40th birthday and from the moment we arrived the staff treated us so warmly. We arrived early and we had booked a room that includes access to the executive lounge. We were invited to wait there while we waited for our room to be ready. It was so nice to be able to have breakfast after a long journey. Our room was beautiful, clean and well appointed with stunning views. Wifi was excellent quality. The executive lounge was a wonderful treat and was well stocked with everything we could need. The hotel is conveniently located with easy access to public transport and taxis waiting outside all the time. The staff at the hotel were truly amazing and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. I even joked with my partner at one stage 'is there anything they can't do' :-) A special mention for Ana, Monica and Daniel who went above and beyond looking after us, helping us with directions and recommending things to do. A true credit to the hotel."
May 2016,50,Great Hotel,"This beautiful hotel is outside of the downtown tourist area which makes it really quiet. It's conveniently located near the metro, bus, and train station. Really close to the airport. Only couple metro stops to downtown. We got there around 7am and they checked us in. Breakfast buffet is good, room is big and clean. Wifi is so strong, you can get it across the street. Highly recommended if you want to be away from the tourist crowd."
May 2016,50,Our 1st Choice in Lisbon Hotels,"Wonderful busy &  very popular  Spa Hotel. Staff are helpful & friendly & nothing seems too much trouble for them to help everyone.Nice pool & relaxing Spa.Metro to Downtown Lisbon,is literally a few minutes away. 6.50 Euros for 24 hour ticket valid for travel on Metro & Trams.Highly recommended."
May 2016,50,Business and Leisure,An excellent stay at the hotel for business and leisure - slightly out of the way for visiting downtown Lisbon but not too difficult with the Metro almost opposite the hotel. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful.  I cannot fault anything.
May 2016,50,Corinthia,"Very good location, service, facilities, breakfast and the staff is also very nice! Very close to the subway station. The bed is very comfortable! Made the Lisbon experience better!! Highly recommended"
May 2016,30,Not the best location for the price,"For staying 2 nights hotel is very good. I stayed 8 and the same breakfast every day :( no pancakes , only corn flakes , only eggs ( over cooked ) omlet and no varieties at all . The stuf is amazing ,"
May 2016,50,excellent value and friendly service,Surrounding area quite built up but metro very easy and good value so easy to get around and 10 mins into the centre. The hotel lovely food excellent and very reasonable .Loved the welcome message that arrived on the television screen and espa products in the bathroom yum☺
May 2016,50,very good hotel,when you are not blind ...this is the most beautiful hotel.1 corinth 13 ...thats the hotel.the beds are exellent.the food is exellent . the swimming pool is exelllent. the stuff everting  is high quality. every 3 days new flowers in the lobby.the porters are verry friendly.the managers are real managers.the man and woman behind the desks are Sirius and calm..no stress. the roommates are super clean.
May 2016,50,Posh's 50 birthday weekend,"We went out to celebrate my birthday and had a great time , the staff couldn't do enough the hotel was very clean the quality of the  service was 5 star. The spa was was relaxing . The staff looked after you in every way. I would recommend staying in the executive rooms and the junior suite as the lounge on the 24 floor  just made it as you had drinks nibbles every day through out the day ..great experience only had one issue the weather it rained but we still had fun"
May 2016,50,Friendly luxury,"This is a very well-appointed, comfortable and classy hotel. The staff are exceptionally friendly, and especially helpful after I left my phone in a taxi before I'd even managed to check in.The spa, food and drinks are a little on the pricey side but that is to be expected in a hotel of this status. The spa in particular is very nice however.The hotel is also well situated, being a 10 minute/€10 taxi ride from the airport and with a nearby metro station getting you to the city centre in about the same time.The rooms are clean and comfortable with free wifi, and the bar has a nice patio area for drinks outside. The swimming pool is also very nice, though I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with kids as it doesn't seem like *that* kind of pool.We were thrilled to stay here, particularly as we found a bit of a deal on prices (so make sure you look around)."
May 2016,40,Stylish Hotel in a quieter part of the city,"The Corinthia Hotel is situated in a business district just a short metro trip from the bustling centre of Lisbon.  As can be expected from this hotel chain the main reception area is beautifully appointed with spacious lobby and helpful and efficient staff ready to take your luggage and ensure that check in is speedy and professional.  There is a large bar and a lovely outdoor garden area for drinks with comfortable settees and tables set amongst waterfalls and pools.Security is good with key card operated lifts to all floors.Our room was well appointed with marble bathroom, his and hers sinks and an enormous extremely comfortable bed.  A plus, as the weather was very hot, was that the windows did open to allow restricted ventilation.Breakfast comprised a very extensive self service buffet with every imaginable item on offer.  Service was unobtrusive.We ate on one evening in the hotel restaurant where there was another extensive self service buffet and hot food could be cooked to order.  Again good service and very reasonably priced.During our stay we had a problem with our room as the door did not work and could not be secured.  The hotel management were very understanding and arranged for us to be moved to the executive floor at no extra cost for the rest of our stay.  This also allowed us unrestricted access to the exclusive lounge on the top floor where there was a private dining area for breakfast and snacks, finger food and drinks all day.The hotel also has a very atmospheric spa with a wide range of treatments on offer.  It costs 20E per person to use per session of two hours.Lisbon in the centre is a very bustling vibrant place with lots of noise and we were very grateful to be staying in the rather more quiet part of the city. It is close to the airport so we got used to seeing planes coming in to land but the noise was not an issue.  I would highly recommend this hotel and when next in Lisbon we will stay here again."
May 2016,50,Stay in Lisbon,"We enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia and would check out the Corinthia at other destinations. The cab rides were short around Lisbon making a good location for the hotel. Staff was friendly, Hotel was clean. We purchased the room off Hotwire which was a great price for our stay and saved a lot of money on short notice for the trip as opposed to booking on the hotel site. Overall, we would return to a Corinthia."
May 2016,50,Very nice stay,Lovely rooms in a good location and excellent value too.A great Hotel with a very nice fitness facility and terrific spa experience. It was a pleasure to stay here.  Easy to wall around town from here. Would stay again!
May 2016,50,Wonderful stay,From the moment we arrived we were treated exceptionally well. We were informed that we were the 'guest of the day' and we received a complementary upgrade with a voucher for use of the spa and a bottle of champagne with strawberries in our room to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel was spotless and the staff were extremely helpful and professional. The room had a lovely view over the city and the metro was a 1 minute walk away. It took ten mins on the metro and we were in the heart of downtown Lisbon. The hotel bar was very relaxing with helpful and professional staff and live music to compliment the atmosphere.  The executive lounge was a real treat if u wanted to hide away and had stunning views and again gave excellent service We look forward to returning to Lisbon again in the future and indeed this wonderful hotel.
May 2016,50,Corinthia Hotel Lisbon,"My stay in the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon has been excellent and I enjoyed the time there a lot. The rooms are great, the food is delicious, the service outstanding. I just can recommend the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon as a very good and convenient hotel."
May 2016,50,Cisco Event,"Let me tell you about the room preparation & service, unique, helpful staff and one of the most amazing gift chocolates they gave.Food perfect, deliciousDrinks same as foodRoom size excellentRoom view amazing"
May 2016,40,Great Stay!,"Stayed here for three nights at the end of April 2016 and it was lovely. The room was a good size, the wifi worked perfectly and the bed was very comfortable. We didn't have the breakfast as we thought it was a little expensive and preferred to eat outside the hotel. The bar area is lovely, quite pricy but not more than you would expect from this standard of hotel. I wouldn't recommend eating at the hotel as although the buffet food is very nice it is also very expensive and it is much cheaper to get something of equal standard in the city centre. The hotel is not in the centre but is close to the metro stop which takes you straight there and is also very near the zoo where you can pick up the Hop on Hop off bus if you wish. The pool and the spa were also very enjoyable although you do have to wear a swimming hat which will cost you 5euro if you need to purchase one there. The staff were very nice and helpful and I would be happy to stay here again."
May 2016,50,Beautiful Hotel,"We went on a holiday to Lisbon and stayed at the Corinthia.  We knew it was a big out of town, but it is very close to a Metro stop so that did not put us off.  It is very close to the zoo, which is one of the things we wanted to do, so we went ahead and booked.  The metro stop is close and convenient and it is quite an easy jaunt into the more touristy areas.  There is also food to be had in the area if you poke around a bit.The staff are friendly, efficient, and helpful.  You're paying for gold standard service and you're getting it.  We had one minor problem during our stay and it was sorted out immediately.The spa is gorgeous - we actually had the whole thing to ourselves when we used it and I wish I'd planned more time for it.The only minor niggle for me was the food/drink - it is very expensive for what it is.  The breakfast buffet was not much more than I'd see in a Travelodge or similar and it was 20 Euros a head.  Cocktails were easily 15 Euros.  The dinner buffet was lovely, but nearly 30 Euros (it is meat grilled to order, but there is a rodizio in the neighborhood that is 22 Euros).  Plan for this or seek food elsewhere.We were on the 16th flood and had a nice view of the viaduct and into the city.  The lifts were efficient and we hardly had to wait whenever we wanted in or out.  There was free WiFi all throughout the hotel that you could connect up to five devices to.  It was sufficient for us to watch Netflix on during a couple evenings.All in all, a great hotel if you don't mind being a bit further out."
May 2016,50,Beautiful hotel in the business area,Home base for me and 100+ coworkers' three day conference.  The room was spacious and comfortable- no complaints. The restaurants and catered snacks were adequate/good. The only negative for a pleasure vacation is the area- you are not within walking distance of shops or tourist areas.
May 2016,40,A week in Lisbon,"Excellent hotel with easy access to the Metro.  Our suite was very well appointed, spacious and comfortable.  The staff is very effective, accessible and always willing to assist with any question you may have.  I found the daily breakfast in the Executive Lounge an excellent way to start the day."
May 2016,50,"Beautiful hotel, wonderful spa, great service...but not near anything.","A great 5 star hotel, wonderful service from the Bellman to the Spa staff.  Ate several times in the restaurants and lounges, service was great.  My 80 minute massage in the SPA was worth every cent after walking around the cobblestone streets of Old Portugal.  Beware when booking through Travelocity, they screwed up my reservation, and trying to get it straightened out while traveling was fruitless.  Thankfully the hotel was helpful. The hotel is not near much tourism wise, but it is right next door to a Subway station (for downtown) and Railway (for a mandatory trip to Sintra)."
May 2016,40,Nice Hotel,"The hotel was excellent in the following areas: conference/meeting rooms and service; comfort and cleanliness of guest rooms and service by all hotel personnel. The location wasn't the best for sight-seeing, but was close to a metro station. My minor complaints were that the room card had to be inserted into a dock in the room in order for the power to the room to work, so it wasn't possible to recharge anything while you are away from the room (unless you get another card), the coffee maker didn't work and the hair dryer made a very loud noise when in use."
May 2016,40,Lovely Lisbon,"Returned to Lisbon slightly sceptical having not enjoyed my previous visit 16 years ago. I had nothing to worry about. The hotel while a little out of town was perfect for a 4 night break. The guest information team recommended fantastic places to eat and the bar staff offered a great knowledge of local wines.The gym was great, although the spa was lacking a Jacuzzi."
May 2016,50,Great Property,"My wife and I had the privilege of staying at the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon.  The hotel itself is terrific, but what set it apart was the attentiveness of the entire staff.  The team went out of their way to make certain our stay was comfortable and we were well looked after.  I highly recommend this property."
May 2016,40,"Excellent, a little pricey at Bar and restaurant though ","Excellent hotel, across the road from the Azul line metro. Service is spot on, maybe a bit formal for some, but they are so efficient. The standard of room is good, I noticed some reviews called it old fashioned, I would refer to it as classical, which suits my taste. Rooms very clean and serviced to an exceptional standard everyday. What prevents a 5 star rating: bar and restaurant are to pricey, I appreciate the standard of service but this does not warrant double the cost. Breakfast is very good, however the evening buffet was a little disappointing, cold plates and food. I'm sure if I complained though, they would have sorted it out immediately (typically British of me to moan afterwards)This said, I would definitely stay again and if you're not on a budget, it's the place to go.  If possible get a floor 18 or above with views over the viaduct"
May 2016,50,Always Great,"A brief overnight stay on business, and the hotel was great.  Friendly people, prompt and attentive.  The room was clean, stocked with most of the amenities one could wish for.  My only finding was in the bar; I was served wine in a glass that although it was clean, had plenty of spots.  Another patron complained about it as well.  A great stay.  Looking forward to a stay where I have more time to enjoy the hotel and the city."
May 2016,40,City trip Lissabon,Overall very good experience. Our room was a bit too small and an extra lounge chair would have been nice. Nice personnel and very good breakfast. A walk to the center of Lissabon takes a bi less thant one hour.
May 2016,50,Very nice hotel,"We stayed at Corinthia for 4 nights and enjoyed it a lot. Great service, great care and great hospitality. It is a bit outside the city center so if you are like us who enjoy walking, it wasn't that bad. But not the most scenic walks out there.  However the metro is right next to the hotel with good rail connections as well. So for day trips i.e. to Sintra, it was amazing. Also right next to the airport. Uber ride is around €7.00, a good alternative to avoid being cheated by the local cab drivers. It is very clean. But you can tell that it is getting a bit worn down. A bit of refurbishment is needed for the rooms. Overall great experience. Is it 5stars? Don't think so but amazing stay never the less. For a business hotel the Internet is not adequate.  As you need to connect using Vpn to your own company network, having to log in via web browser makes this impossible. A direct, Ethernet would have been amazing."
May 2016,50,Quickie in Portugal,"Wonderful hotel But for the lack of towels and basic amenities in the sun deck ( water,attendant, Etc.) I could not find fault. Very well done, food service and presentation above average and a willingness to be helpful was obvious at all staff levels."
May 2016,40,Luxury and Facility's with great views city side,"We paid extra for a executive room and vip lounge, well worth the extra money - we found the room a little small and some things didn't work but they soon sorted the problems out. The vip lounge is excellent, great attentive friendly service, free refreshments until 10pm - you can choose breakfast up there with fantastic views or eat downstairs with more choice. The breakfast buffet is really good everything you would expect and more. Theres a great bar, good outdoor space and spa facilities - I was disappointed we had to buy a swimming cap for the pool as don't see the point in them! plus the jacuzzi and steam room are charged extra which looked amazing but didn't have time (20 euros each for 2 hrs). The only one issue is the hotel is out of the centre of Lisbon and has to be accessed by the slightly seedy metro (blue line) - cheap enough and easy to navigate -  but worth knowing, although the metro is just a few minutes walk from the hotel and you can get to the airport with just one change for a mere 1.40 euros for one trip. When the taxi is around 18 euros and not much quicker in traffic. Not much around the area looks like a business hub with a few evening restaurants, inc Chinese and Japanese - plus the Zoo is just across the road. (The twin towers shopping centre across the road seems to be shut down but looks bad anyway). So all in all a great hotel if your after a little tranquility and fine serve in 5* luxury."
Apr 2016,40,Big comfortable hotel a bit removed from the hustle ,"This is a large, well-run, comfortable hotel. The staff is friendly and efficient. The only downside is that it's a bit removed from the downtown (though right next to the metro) and there are rooms that allow smoking. While we opted for a smoke free room, we still smelled a very faint bit of smoke-perhaps from the linens?"
Apr 2016,40,Good hotel with some remarks,"Overall the room was good, although no power plugs near the bed for charging a phone, no hand shower, only a fixed shower head, and a left-over nail or lens on the floor. Also the elevator system is not that efficient, the home is modern and comfortable with good facilities, kitchen etc. Nice team, very helpful and command of English language is good."
Apr 2016,50,Luxury at its best,"Very good experience .price paid was great but did not include breakfast . At this price breakfast should have been included . Beat part was ,taxi was not available due to walkout by taxi , luckily metro was so close made all the difference . Door man was helpful in directing action ."
Apr 2016,50,Quiet and comfortable,Only stayed here one night before an early morning flight. The room was quiet and comfortable. We had easy access to the metro and only a short taxi ride to the airport. Very close to the Jardim Zoologique! Reasonably priced. Good value.
Apr 2016,40,Goog Hotel,"Good rooms, very clean, maintenence OK, good breakfast, very good WIFI system, rooms well equiped, sweemingpool, live music in the bar, good air conditioningOut of the center, prices in the bar a little hight,"
Apr 2016,50,Recent stay,"Lovely place to stay and intending to go back. Short metro ride to centre of town. Would recommend upgrading to include access to executive club lounge, for extra special service and great views. Enjoyed our spa experience to end our holiday."
Apr 2016,50,Another excellent stay ...,"Great hotel for our time in Lisbon, probably a better location than being more central due to the local restaurants and bars. Access to the centre of the city is easy via the metro etc. Good to see customer loyalty valued!"
Apr 2016,40,recent stay at this hotel,came to this hotel for my wife s birthday and all the staff that we came in contact with went out of their way to make her day very special would recommend this hotel and cant wait to go to the sister hotel in San Anton Malta on the 4th June
Apr 2016,30,NOT a 5 star hotel!,"For the price we paid at this hotel, we were expecting a much better service than what we have received.Positives:- the bed in the executive junior suite was very nice.- the view from that room was also nice.- the chocolates left in the room after cleaning each day was a nice gesture.- the breakfast downstairs was excellent ( the service was very attentive and polite), their selection of cheese, bread, salads etc was very nice.- service at the door was always polite.- the elevator at the building was kind of cool, however they should explain how it works better to the older folks ( we saw a lot of people having trouble with it)- location was good, close to the tour buses ( 1 block away) and pretty close to the center and the airport.- the room was also very clean, and the cleaning stuff even folded our clothes that were left out.Negatives:- the service we have received at the club lounge was unacceptable! During the breakfast there was nobody there to help you if you had any questions. The cook was never at his tiny station that he was supposed to prepare meals. - breakfast at the club lounge was a joke! Their selection of food was very limitited, and it wasn't worth paying extra for the executive type of rooms to receive this service!- the snacks at the club lounge were almost non existent. A few bowls with Pringles chips, some veggies, stale pastries... Not worth it.- the people at the guest service desk weren't very nice and helpful. I had trouble with wifi and the lady that was supposed to help me was rude.Overal, we enjoyed our stay in Lisbon. And, since we were mostly out and about and returned to Corinthia hotel only at night, we were comfortable in the hotel. However, for the price I have paid here and the service o received I would not be coming back nor would I recommend this hotel to anyone."
Apr 2016,50,A special hotel with amazing staff,"We had an amazing stay at the Corinthia. Nice hotel, pretty, professional to the best standard. Staff - outstanding!!! Was truly excellent. I will definitely return with friends. Service - polity, generous, creative, patient. Very welcoming"
Apr 2016,40,Lisbon WITH friends,"Very comfortable and nice hotel, kind service and we really appreciated that they celebrate the birthday of my friend with a cake and champagne. Only problems with keys because they often didn't work."
Apr 2016,50,"Excellent service, very professional and helpful staff","I stayed for 4 night with my husband and a couple of cousins of ours. The hotel is beautiful, very refine decorations, it is sparkling clean, the food is gorgeous and the staff very nice, professional and friendly!!! It has confirmed the ecellent experience I had at the Corinthia St.George Bay in Malta!FAVOLOSO!!!! Thank you!!!!"
Apr 2016,50,What a treat,This was a birthday trip and a fairly last minute booking found on Secret Escapes. A proper 5 star hotel with excellent service and gorgeous facilities decoration furniture and great staff. Couldn't do enough for you and nothing was a problem - a real treat !!
Apr 2016,50,Excellent place to stay!,"If you're planning to spend some time in Lisbon, Corinthia Hotel Lisbon is one of the best places to stay.  Consider it!  you will not be disappointed in any aspect: services, meals, conferencing, wellness, etc."
Apr 2016,50,"Location, quality, fitness and health....","I actually used the pool, the gym and the hotel day spa - Miracle!!!  And they were all very good. Quiet, clean, all you needed.  The pool area could do with wi-fi is my only comment but hey, you probably should be relaxing and off your phone anyway!  The hotel was great - right next to the train station and very very easy to do the metro each day into two to the sights - we loved Lisbon.  Mind you, the museum and zoo is walking distance so you won't need the metro those days.Ask for a room high up to get the view.  Really, this hotel has everything you need, the rooms were large and spotless.  We really did love this place and we stayed a few days longer for over a week. I would definitely recommend this hotel as we had a great sleep each night in pitch dark rooms with comfy beds.  That made us refreshed for our next day's sightseeing.  We loved all the fresh flowers in the hotel."
Apr 2016,50,"Excellent service, great views, attentive staff","Stayed here for a global conference with 400+ people.  Service, staff, food, and facilities were excellent.  Views toward the west from upper floors and Executive Lounge highlighted old and new parts of the city, including an ancient aqueduct, and modern suspension bridge over the bay (similar to the iconic San Francisco Bay bridge in the U.S.).  Location is in newer suburban area; center of old town tourist area is ~10 minute taxi ride (<10 Euro).  Tourist buses also pick up near the hotel; tickets can be purchased from the concierge.  Taxis, buses, and subway are convenient.  Concierge staff were most helpful!  Staff can arrange for Private Transfer (professional driver) to/from airport and other locations; charge conveniently can be added to hotel bill.  Currency exchange is available at the front desk.  And staff speak multiple languages for guest convenience."
Apr 2016,30,A mixed experience,"A modern hotel with absolutely excellent wifi, a snazzy lift key thing going on, and an amazing breakfast selection - refreshed until the last minute - which I did not do justice to at all.  I was expected; my registration was handled very exactingly although I sensed (perhaps wrongly) that they weren't too fond of bookings.com.  To be fair, I was initially shown a slightly larger twin room but, travelling alone and paying a room rate - and a five star stay being a brief comfort break for a by now footsore traveller - I wanted a few good nights' sleep and requested a double bed, instead.  Whilst my request was rapidly accommodated, I was shown to a very small room with an incredibly dirty carpet.  It was also right above the spa and, as my stay progressed, proved to be very noisy - and cold (yes I did try to adjust the aircon). I was assured it was the 'superior double' grade I had booked and paid for, and I was tired, so I made do.  I gather one would ordinarily have a room upgrade, but I doubted even the 'superior' nature of the room I was given (I see the hotel does also offer 'standard' rooms).  It was later explained to me that the hotel was very busy, and there were better rooms on the fifth floor but I had not wanted to stay in a smoking room (do they still have those?), so that was why I was put where I was.  I used the gym, pool and spa a few times, all of which I found impressive for a city hotel.  However on leaving the spa area, the first time, I had difficulty making the snazzy lift key work and was left partly dressed and unable to get back to my room.  The spa staff also being unable to make my key work, a suited manager was asked for advice.  I heard him say I would need to sort it out at reception, and someone kindly called the lift for me, which I was unable to do for myself.  Although I was waiting on my own for some time, as the lift doors opened aforementioned manager barged past me to get in first and, when we arrived at the bottom, barged out ahead of me in an 'important-looking' hurry.  When I got to reception, our suited manager disappearing on a mission through the door behind it, I explained my plight and was admonished for not having the 'right permissions' put on my key.  On check-in, I had been told I had free use of the spa area but nobody had told me about having to have the right permissions on my key... I was left feeling that this was a hotel that ran more for the convenience of the staff / efficiency of the organisation, than for the experience of the guests.  I also didn't particularly like the 'leather desk and comfortable chairs on a fluffy rug with sherry' set up, in the middle of the smart communal lobby, to welcome only the 'most special guests'.  Surely we are all special... The brightest star for me in the customer service galaxy was the concierge, whose name I should have noted.  His staff weren't too forthcoming with tourist information, asking me what leaflet I specifically wanted (umm - first time in Lisbon; I didn't know what was on offer), but the concierge saw my dilemma and intervened.  He was patient, kind and extremely helpful, explaining the different options for sightseeing and the tourist buses, advising me on the nicest lines to take for the sort of things I wanted to do - and carefully directing me to the right stop.  Thanks to him, I saw a lot more of Lisbon than I might have done.  It is a lovely city.  I am sure the hotel is exceptionally busy, and very efficiently run, the breakfast was first class and, with such excellent wifi, I can imagine it being excellent for conferences or business stays.  My own experience was a mixed one."
Apr 2016,30,ok but needs update,"the hotel is ok overall but I wouldn't give it a 5 star rating, the room was clean and room service was fine but the carpet was stained through use and needed to be replaced, the tiles in the bathroom were a little loose but ok and there were marks on the wall where it needed to be repainted, the chair was placed in front of this - that would have worked but I had to move the chair to move a table next to the bed as I had no bed side table (that was annoying!). It's not an untidy hotel.two annoying things- the lift, swipe, type in the floor, wait for A,B,C or D, nobody tells you that, just go to the lift and use your card, we made a mistake the first time as did many others!- the room card kept wiping itself and this meant a visit to reception for a reset, just annoying and at busy times it meant a wait.it is a bit out of town but easy to get into town, about 6 euro each way by cab or metro which is across the road. If I went back to Lisbon for business it would be ok otherwise I would stay in one of the more tourist area based hotels."
Apr 2016,50,Truly Five Star !!!,"We had and executive junior suite it was very well appointed with high  furnishings and toiletries. The entire hotel is magnificent and opulent ,but retains a casual atmosphere.The staff are very friendly and always ready to help. Each one of them took real pride in ""their ""hotel.Admittedly the hotel is a little bit out from the centre, but it is only a short walk from the train station and the metro.Stay here you will not be disappointed."
Apr 2016,40,"Good hotel, friendly staff","I visited the Corinthia Lisbon for a work related Symposium with 400+ participants last week and the hotel is fantastic for such a big event. The staff is very friendly and able to manage large groups during coffee breaks and lunch. The rooms are nicely appointed, only (personal comment) I don't like showering in a tub, would prefer a shower on its own. The bed is comfortable. Overal for a work trip great, but for a city trip or short holiday I'd prefer a hotel closer to the historic city center."
Apr 2016,50,Fabulous hotel,We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and will return in the future without any doubt ! Would recommend it to anyone looking for a high class luxurious hotel at an affordable price and excellent location!
Apr 2016,30,Out of the way conference focused hotel,"It is clear this hotel caters to conferences and not to tourists.  Good conference facilities, and staff are bi-lingual.  Not a hotel for tourists.  It is out of the way from the major sites and locations of what you want to experience in Lisbon.  Could not get the room air con to work.  Had to sleep with the windows open to get the room to be not hot.  Wifi was slow."
Apr 2016,40,Slick and discreet hotel,Have stayed here on a number of times and always enjoy the professional but friendly way the staff conduct their business. Location can be a problem as not in centre but metro very near and car parking good.
Apr 2016,40,A great place for stay and functions,"I was attending a conference held at Corinthia Lisbon. It is a big luxury hotel slightly off the city centre. The rooms were well appointed and maintained with all modern facilities. The food was excellent. They have big spaces for conferences and functions. The service was also great. A metro station very near to the hotel makes it easy to connect to the attractions in Lisbon. The location is off the hustle and bustle of the city centre. There are very few shops and restaurants near by. We had a conference attended by around 400 delegates. At times getting an elevator was difficult with so much of people trying to use one. Columbia mall, not far off,  is a good option for people who would like to shop."
Apr 2016,50,Luxury!,"We were accomodated in Junior Suite on the 19. Floor. The room was spacious with nice views, very quite and equpped with all the amenities one might need. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We got a nice welcome from the management which we really appreciatted. I have used the gym and pool to my satisfaction (all clean and modern). The Aqua area of the Spa is paid but totally worth it. We have relaxed in small massage pools, jacuzzi, hammam and sauna. The breakfast buffet is quite rich and all food is very fresh and tasty. The location of the hotel is not central but close to the airport, ZOO and the metro which takes you to the centre in minutes. We will come back!"
Apr 2016,50,Gorgeous hotel!,We had an amazing stay! After arriving at the front desk for a 3 day trip to Lisbon they inform us we have been chosen as the guests of the day! We got an unbelievable upgrade to an executive suite with full access to the executive lounge and free vouchers for the spa! We were delighted to hear this great news! It really made our trip special and we enjoyed every minute of the hotel! The breakfast was amazing! The bar was lovely and relaxed. Our suite was just incredible. Bed was so comfy! Would highly recommend this hotel. 2 minute walk to the metro station and the metro was only about 5 or 10 minutes into the main areas of the city so it all worked out perfectly. Great value for money and a fantastic all round experience!
Apr 2016,20,Disappointing - not a five star service,"We encountered numerous problems during our stay. The follow up by hotel management was slow and poor and required constant follow up by us - ruining the atmosphere and creating a lot of hassle. In short: 1) Unavailability of Spa for 3 out of 7 days2) Loud maintenance work in the room next door! Drilling, banging throughout the day. Workers everywhere. Management claimed to be unaware and we were not moved before day 4.3) Poor follow through on guest services requests- eg call for Taxi, iron, booking restaurants.4) Very late room tidy- on occasion not before 3pm.5) Menu variety and quality in executive business lounge not very impressive."
Apr 2016,20,Service and some facilities were definitely not of a 5* standard,"FACILITIES:We went here for a Hen holiday in a group of 6. We purposely picked a nice looking hotel with spa access as we envisaged bad weather for our stay and wanted to relax in doors for some of it. When we went to use the spa, we were told it was an additional charge of 20 euro per person, per day, (most hotels allow usage for free for staying guests), + 5 euro for a compulsory swimming hat. When we then went to use, we were informed  the spat was out of order. It took 2-3 days for this to be fixed (half of our stay). As a compensation we got given some free pastries. (Think we would have preferred free entry when it DID open).SERVICEOne of our rooms was then placed directly next door to a room being worked on. The Drilling and banging was so loud, we could not even speak to one another. When we reported the problem, the member of staff seemed to not even know work was happening, and then made no attempt to fix the problem. We were advised she was informing the manager, but then she came back with options which were far from compensating, and instead encouraged us to spend more money. We were not happy with this lack of accountability at all, and escalated the problem further. About 3 days into our stay, we were finally moved to a room which was supposed an upgrade (looked exactly the same), with access to the exec lounge. When we decided to have breakfast at the exec lounge, we realised the options there were much smaller then those downstairs in normal restaurant- so not very consistent.Other issues:- Odd, inpratical layout of rooms- no sockets near mirrors, so hard to dry hair or get ready easily.- Channel selection on TV, very poor- have been to 3-4* that have more options with some english channels.- Slow service- not always consistent. When one of us asked for an iron, took an hour to get it.- Rooms were sometimes not cleaned till very late in the day. Occasionally, some items were topped up/replaced, others were not (ie replacing two people's bath robes with one?).TREATMENTS:Once the spa did open, we headed down to make use, only to be told it was fully booked. We would have to return the next day. At this point, we mentioned to one of the staff the inconvenience this had caused, and the effect it had on our trip, as we particularly picked a hotel with spa access, so were not happy that it was unavailable for half of our stay. She was very accommodating and offered us access the next day for half price."
Apr 2016,40,super confortable Bed.,"Elegant hotel, facilities. Close to metro and train. But you always need to take the metro little bit too far walking and nothing nice in that area to see or to go to eat. You can do the 24 hours viva viagem card and u can take bus metro and tram how many times you want. But after few days start to be expensive. Soi normally prefer hotel which are closer to the center where i can walk. But that is a very nice hotel... you got as well gym free 24hours (small but ok) and pool free. If u want spend a little more spa snd other facilities."
Apr 2016,30,location,"The location of the hotel was not optimal for tourism. We had to travel to get to any of the sites we wanted to see. The rooms and food were good, but we had a language problem with security who insisted there were several complaints about us. We think it was that we didn't hang up the phone properly after the wake-up call, but he came to our room acting belligerent rather than concerned, but we never got an apology."
Apr 2016,50,"Wonderful, gracious hotel near metro","The Corinthia has everything: beautiful lobby, gym, bar, restaurant and rooms, and great service. It's the best staff-to-guest ratio I've seen and all staff are helpful. Executive club upgrade well with the extra cost for the views, happy hour and Nespresso!"
Apr 2016,50,A perfect classic hotel with impeccable service,"The lobby is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, the executive club is welcoming (with champagne & snacks served all day & many free foreign language newspapers), and the staff is plentiful and helpful. Many newer hotels focus on showiness, but the Corinthia focuses on a high staff-to-guest ratio and responding to guests' needs. The hotel is steps from the Zoo metro station, and on a street with many restaurants. The lobby is huge and there's live piano music most every night. Guest rooms are serviced twice daily. The towels are exceptionally large and fluffy, and you get a linen floormat beside your bed each evening. The gym has the latest equipment and an exercise specialist to help you out. There's a large pool and spa. Dinner in the dining room (Tipico) features a Portuguese buffet -- delicious & reasonably priced at about €30. I upgraded to the executive club for an additional €30 per day which includes a full breakfast in the magnificent penthouse suite overlooking the city and aqueduct. Wine, beer, soft drinks and snacks are served here all day. Daniel, the waiter, is delightful and helpful, and the hostess, Monica, makes good tourist recommendations and books tickets for guests. After a few days I felt completely at home in this wonderful hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat. It's a great hotel if what you're looking for is quiet luxury, & respectful treatment, without a lot of hype."
Apr 2016,50,The Beaumont,Two very happy 😊 travelers from the UK.This Hotel rates with one of the best We have had the pleasure of staying in over 25 yrs around Europe.We will definitely be back within the next two years.Thanks
Apr 2016,40,Nice hotel in a convenient location,Attended a conference here.  Our group was a little large for this venue but the hotel accommodated us quite well.  Only issue was related to the lifts (elevators) not being able to accommodate a large group when the conference ended each day.  My wife accompanied me on this trip and we stayed two extra days.  Hotel staff were all very helpful and pleasant.  Great breakfast and lunch buffets.
Apr 2016,40,Bid09,I stayed here last year beautiful and classy hotel and i would find it hard to fault spotlessly clean and rooms fab loved the pianist playing in bar at night and staff were very friendly and helpful its a pity that no bars or restaurants close to hotel but it would not put me of staying again also it was a lovely touch the way the porters hold the door as you walk in and flag down taxis for the people staying there.lisbon is a beautiful city and so is this hotel
Apr 2016,50,A great holiday,"I booked this stay at Corinthia Lisbon as a special holiday for my wife's birthday.  What attracted me was the luxury, the spa facilities and the reasonable price.  I was not disappointed.We booked for a week so we had plenty of time to enjoy the sights of Lisbon as well as enjoy some relaxing time in the hotel spa.The staff in all areas of the hotel were extremely helpful and friendly.On a particular day the spa was closed for maintenance - we were very disappointed because this facility was one of the reasons I booked this hotel.  However, Ines on the Guest Services desk went out of her way to make other arrangements.  I was very pleased with how this was handled.We really enjoyed cocktails in the hotel bar of an evening - nice piano playing in the background.The hotel is only about 150m from a metro and train station.  It takes about 10 minutes by metro to get downtown.  From the railway station it is about 35 minutes direct to Sintra.Nearby ther is a great choice of restaurants.Finally our room had a most fantastic view.  In the foreground a high arched aqueduct and in the background the suspension bridge across the river which apparently is a copy of the Golden Gate Bridge."
Apr 2016,40,A pleasant place with some hidden gems,"I originally chose to stay at Corinthia as it was close to the airport and I had a couple of days to kill before another flight. I have to say this place surprised me. I thought the hotel would be a bit to ""businessy"" but it has a really friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The staff are fantastic, very friendly and equally professional. The hotel also has a fantastic pool and gym of the the standard of a luxury spa hotel - it is free to use.The spa are with steam room  an saunas is €20 and if you need a bit of de-stressing it is well worth it. It was absolutely beautiful and felt a bit like a hidden gem.The food from the restaurant was all great. Breakfast was fairly standard but the main meals were excellent.I would definitely stay here again and think it's a good hotel for a variety of travellers from families to business travellers."
Apr 2016,50,Wonderful hotel,"We stayed 3 nights in a junior suite. The room was great and the amenities were sufficient.As soon as you enter the hotel lobby the staff are there to greet you with smiles and welcoming warmth. Check-in was smooth and easy.The hotel is a bit out of the central area of Lisbon, but good public transport links makes it easy to get where you want to go. A 3 minute walk to the metro blue line. A 7 minute walk to the zoo.The breakfast in the hotel was plentiful with so many choices available. The swimming pool was a great way got our daughter to burn off what energy she had left after a day's walking around town.The lobby bar with great piano music has a nice relaxing atmosphere to unwind and have a drink before going to bed.An all round great hotel and worthy of a revisit in the future."
Apr 2016,50,Very nice,"Very nice hotel, good service, using GHA DISCOVERY bonus program. Unfortunately I was recognised as GHA Platinum member but room and food was great anyway. Never slept better in a hotel bed! Located ab it out of town but ok."
Apr 2016,50,5 star quality,"My husband and I spent a long weekend at this hotel it was perfect. It deserves its 5 star rating, you will not be disappointed. The staff are professional, courteous, and very welcoming; none of the stuffy informal behaviour you receive at lesser rated establishments. Good value for money."
Apr 2016,50,Excellent business hotel,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a business trip and found the hotel, the staff, the food and facilities to be EXCELLENT. The hotel staf is exceedingly professional and tries hard to please. I was able to check in early luckily because I had flown overnight. The breakfast was included in the room rate and was varied and fresh. The pool is very peaceful and nice. My bed was comfortable and the marble bathroom very clean. I appreciated the help of the doorman and concierge during my stay. Thank you. I will return."
Apr 2016,40,"They are not in Center, so they have to be on their toes. And they are!","I have seen it often, with hotels as well as restaurants. They may not have the most central location (but Corinthia is perfect for transport, metro 200 meters away 8.5 minutes to center) so they have to compensate by giving perfect service and reasonable prices. Which Corinthia does. I had a nice large junior suite, very suitable for working part of my holiday. Air condition did not give wanted temperature, I could have used a bit more heat in chilly April. Staff service fast, friendly and efficient."
Apr 2016,40,"Five Star hotel Downstairs, 3.5 Star Hotel Upstairs","The hotel lobby, services, dining options, pool, spa, exercise room and event options are very classy and worthy of five stars. Very top notch. The problem I ran into is that the elevators are very, very slow and when you have a lot of people at the hotel it makes it extremely annoying. Also the bedrooms are very hot and I was told that the air conditioning is not very strong and not much they can do about it other open a window. Guest services eventually found a room fan for us to use. I would hate to stay here in the summer when it gets really hot out. Another thing that was a bit annoying is the lack of places to plug in electrical devices. In today's world, especially when trying to work with multiple mobile devices, there just wasn't very many options to plug in. No USB connections in the room and only one area hidden on the desk to plug in two devices."
Apr 2016,50,Great hotel,This is a beautiful hotel. Excellent service.  Stayed there for both business and pleasure. The location is very close to all transportation and is great as a home base to head out to other areas on tours.
Apr 2016,50,Truly five star experience,"Wonderful hotel. We stayed in a junior suite which was spacious, and well furnished. Bed was extremely comfortable. Heating control wasn't the most responsive, but apart from that everything else about the room was brilliant. The hotel bar could have had a better selection of imported beers, Sagras on draught and Heinneken, but the pianist really made the bar with his individual interpretations of modern songs. The location of the hotel is great for transport links, but if you just wanted to walk out in the evening to a local bar for a drink and sample of local life, you would be hard put to find one. Lovely hotel to come back to at the end of a full sightseeing day. We were there for seven days and our excellent experience in the hotel, together with some sunny weather and the city of Lsbon itself, means we take away a very positive feeling for somewhere we have never been before and for which we will now return"
Apr 2016,50,Great hotel!,"We have had a full week in Corinthia Hotel and EVERYTHING about it was FANTASTIC. Staff delightful, food sensational, great pianist in bar, large bedrooms with most comfortable beds imaginable. And we had a very reasonable price deal. Only negative is no local bars & small selection of local restaurants, but very near metro to get into centre. A rarity - we actually miss the hotel. Very highly recommended."
Apr 2016,10,Refused to handle Air Conditioning.,"The staff constantly offered to remedy the problem with the air conditioning or have us switch rooms. Unfortunately offering to handle the air conditioning does not repair it. And they never allowed us to switch rooms. 4 Nights of sweating all night long.Make no mistake they only offer the appearance of service, not the substance."
Apr 2016,50,Service,"The staff in every area was kind and cordial.  I felt that they wanted to help me with any request.  The service at check in, check out, and the restaurant was exceptional.  The staff were friendly and willing to provide assistance.  Thank you!"
Apr 2016,50,Conference spot,Good facilities for big conference. Gluten free meal provided fine after some discussions.Trouble with sslow lifts when we all decided to use it. Good location next to Metro and excellent sushi bar around the corner.
Apr 2016,50,Great hotel,"Nice hotel close to airport and the city center. Very good breakfast, perfect services, excellent spa and pool. I stayed five nights with ma wife, and enjoyed very much. Subway station is 5 minutes from the hotel."
Apr 2016,40,Conference tourist,"Power supply is hidden into the desk. Elevator waiting, if all delegates of conference want to move in same time, was not so easy. But everything was OK, clean and correct. People smiling all the time."
Apr 2016,50,Excellent Experience!,The staff and facilities were amazing!  They made my stay a pleasure and made me feel special.    The food was fantastic and was very high quality.I will stay here again and I highly recommend the Corinthia Hotel.
Apr 2016,40,Great Pick for the ISACA - Global Leaders  Summit,"An organization of more than 450 people staying at the hotel... Everything went very well and not heard of any complaints.... The business set-up and the conference room design and sound were so good... Breakfast and Dinner were buffet set-up and very good meals enjoyed by everyone from different cultures, religions and eating habits.... Professionals there... Thanks to all..."
Apr 2016,50,Exceptional Service .. hope to return soon,"The accommodation at this hotel was amazing, enjoyed the breakfast, the staff was very friendly and willing to assist.  I recently stayed there for a conference with over 400 attendees, it was seamless, the hotel is located about 10 -15 from the airport which was very convenient for us."
Apr 2016,50,Very impressed!,"I stayed at this hotel as the venue of our recent conference.  Needless to say, I was very impressed of the facilities, friendly and helpful staff, proximity to the airport, security, amenities, breakfast and my room.  Not a typical small European room, bed and pillows cozy, well maintained and appointed.  I was a bit frustrated of the TV remote control as I believe they needed fresh batteries.  I left a note for cleaning lady about it but noted it was still the same the following day.  I made it work though a bit frustrating.  Overall however, I was impressed of the hotel and really enjoyed my stay."
Apr 2016,40,Conference in Lisbon,"Great facility, staff was friendly and responsive and the food was terrific. The rooms were comfortable and well-appointed. The elevators were a bit cramped and were hard to get at high-volume times. The meeting facilities were in a great part of the hotel and easy to access."
Apr 2016,50,Great Hotel with Immaculate Facilities,"Stayed in Corinthia Lisobon for 5 nights.  The room is immaculately clean and the housekeeping service never failed to tidy up everything, including providing a complimentary bottle of water. Hotel is located conveniently near a metro station, so it is very easy to make your way to the various attractions around Lisbon.  Only 3 stops away from Colombo, a large shopping centre with a food court.  Nevertheless, there are many small cafes around the hotel, which are well-priced and good."
Apr 2016,50,Excellent,"I had a large conference at the hotel this month and I was very impressed with the staff at the hotel. The rooms were fantastic, food was very good and the conference logistics were excellent. The front desk staff was very accommodating for all of our requests. The hotel is also located close to a metro station and within a 7-10 euro cab ride from the city center. I highly recommend the hotel."
Apr 2016,50,Best Hotel in Lisboa,"We stayed at the Corinthia Hotel for a week in April and it was absolutely wonderful.  The enter staff was fabulous and extremely helpful as this was our first time to Portugal.  The hotel was beautiful and the executive club was better than any we had ever experienced.  Daniel in the executive club was amazing, he made our trip in Lisbon extremely memorable."
Apr 2016,50,Seamless Experience,"The hotel makes everything easy from room comfort through to wifi access, with plenty of friendly staff always around if you have any query.  I wish I had been able to stay there longer and make more use of the facilities."
Apr 2016,40,Very good hotel,"The stay at the hotel was very good, and the staff friendly and helpful.  Climate control in rooms - excellent and not intruding. Minor inconvenience was elevators waiting during peak hours, an some minor details of cleanliness, due to an old age of the building. Overall i enjoyed it."
Apr 2016,50,Great hotel/un gran hotel,"Estuve alojado en este hotel.para un evento de negocios por 4 dias. Sencillamente espectacular. Lujoso, cómodo  y excelente servicio.I booked at this hotel because a business event was there. It's one of the.most luxury hotel in Lisbon. Comfortable and great service"
Apr 2016,40,"Great hotel, great location","Great hotel with very nicely decorated rooms, providing plenty of space, amenities and services as well. Great lobby and outdoor areas. Staff is accommodating and friendly. The location is great as well. It resides in a safe area close to the city center. Would go again."
Apr 2016,40,Modern hotel away from historic district,This is a large hotel that is used for large conferences. The hotel is in the financial district about 6-7 subways stops from the historic area or long cab drive. In led breakfast was excellent. The room was large and airy with excellent storage areas except for a lack of a shelf in the bathroom.
Apr 2016,40,Good Experience,Cornithia Hotel is a good hotel at Lisbon for business purpose. Nice hospitality shown by Staff. Good to stay in a hotel which is npt far away from Airport and the city centre. The best thing is that its just opposite to the zoological metro station.
Apr 2016,50,We've stayed twice and will use it again.,"The Corinthia is not in a beautiful or charming part of Lisbon. It is a taxi ride away from all the good stuff. BUT it is an excellent place to stay, especially just before departing Lisbon by air. It is spotlessly clean, very well-staffed with exceptionally helpful people ( no ""attitude"" when we stupidly got locked out of our room, and a gracious and prompt assistance with opening a wine bottle we had brought to the room ). Further, the cabs to the airport are lined up just outside the lobby each morning so there is no hassle or anxiety about this. And the breakfast: you've never seen a more bounteous or attractive hotel offering---if you can't find 5 things you like in this extensive buffet then you just can't be pleased anywhere in life."
Apr 2016,30,Global meeting,"Big hotel, nice staff. Quite old fashioned now and expensive. But during big conferences you will wait for lifts (long minutes) and for food. Breakfast could be better for 5 star hotel. Nice wellness and fitness center. Pool is quite small. Hotel suitable for older husbands or groups not for families with small kids."
Apr 2016,30,Some things could be better..,Nice room and hotel bur do not expect to use a well functioning Internet or listen to what they say on TV channels. We were kicked out all the time and skipped news on TV. Nice staff and food including good recommendations where to go.
Apr 2016,40,Great service.. decent room,"Let me start by saying that the staff is super amazing. And the breakfast buffet was great. The waffles are amazing. It's a beautiful city but I have only some one problem. I stayed in room 415 and there was a door stopper behind the door in the middle of the bathroom floor. Every single time I tried to reach the toilet, my little finger hit it and bled. Should have changed the room but was too lazy and tired after work to move my stuff out."
Apr 2016,50,The Isaiah's family holiday,"Excellent service at the executive lounge. Excellent SPA , Gym and swimming pool facilities. looking forward to coming back again with my family. We would love to explore the town more. Perhaps visit the tourist attractions we could not get to this time."
Apr 2016,50,The best service,"Me and my boyfriend was in Lissabon for a couple days and stayed at Corinthia hotel. It was very very good! Got the best service all over the hotel and if there was rain we got to borrow an umberella without any problem. The breakfast was so so good. It is something you definetley gonna miss. There was never a problem to get a taxin because it was always several outside the hotel! The guest service was always availible to help you and did it well!It was a big plus with the man who played in the bar, pianobar!! Fantastic!I recomend this from the bottom of my heart!"
Apr 2016,30,Recent Stay,The double glazing was poor and we had noise from the railway station and traffic.  There was mould on the walls in the bathroom.  There is no power near a mirror for the hair drier. The benches in the Sete Colinas restaurant were filthy!  Service was poor - it was difficult to get someone to top up the coffee cups at breakfast.
Apr 2016,50,Great Hotel,Here for business and was recommended this hotel received an upgrade to a suite which always makes things better. Unfortunately I have no time to explore but the hotel has some good facilities such as a pool and a gym. The bar is OK but expensive and the restaurant for dinner well let's just say you have to be a business person on his own to think about venturing in. If I had of arrived earlier in the day and had time to explore i would of avoided the hotel restaurant but it was easy. The food was below average and expensive. As I say my room was upgraded so I have no complaints about the room its huge and the separate living room allowed me to work at a proper desk and not perched on my bed. Hope to return and hopefully not just for business.
Apr 2016,40,Stylish and relaxing,"Stayed here for a 4 night city break... got a special half price Easter offer of €110/rm/nt which made it more affordable. Nicely appointed bedrooms which were a bit warm (to early in the year for the AC to be operational). Staff very helpful, with spacious communal areas. Great swimming pool (kids loved it) but you need to being a swimming cap or you'll have to buy one for €5 each!  Dining not the high point of the stay; both the buffet breakfast and dinner not the best quality and very expensive.  Very near the city zoo (hit with the kids) and near metro and suburban train lines."
Apr 2016,30,Ok,"The accomodation needs reviewing basic things like hairdryer, table mirror, kettle should be on table would make the experience easier for guests. Loved the room service, nice gym needs music.an ambience"
Apr 2016,40,Great hotel,Family of 5 trip to Lisbon. Ideal hotel - kids loved the pool and breakfast buffet. Comfy beds. Easy to travel into city via metro or cab. Short walk to zoo - we ran out of time so will do this on our next trip. Minor downside was having no English language tv channels other than news - not great for kids.
Apr 2016,40,Nice hotel,"Was very warm in the room, wasn't able to turn down the thermostat. Everyone was really friendly and helpful, though. The pool is nice, but really busy. The restaurants have good food, but they're very expensive. Good location, easy to get around from here. The staff is so very friendly."
Apr 2016,50,Cosy hotel with very nice service,"Our stay in Lisbon has just been better thanks to this wonderful place. We spent 3 nights for easter and it has been perfect.I have read a lot that the hotel was far from the center and I was kind of fearing this. It is indeed 10 to 15 min by public transport and then 2min walking from the station. A very tiny drawback compared to all the good things this hotel has to offer.The staff is smiling and very polite, the service is overall very good. The room was clean, spacious, cosy and weel furnished.I would advise to those who want to stay in this hotel to go for the exclusive rooms instead: the breakfast is included, access to the 24th floor which is a good place for the view, free food and drinks all along the day...Thanks you for this very nice holidays."
Apr 2016,50,Great hotel,The Hotel was the best my wife and I have been for the past years. The executive advantages are a real must. The lounge at the 24th floor is simply great. The staff is always trying to help you the best they can and if there is anything that is not as you would like they really try do everything they can to make sure that your wish comes true.A big thank you to all the staff. We will most certainly come back.
Apr 2016,50,Lisbona Trip,"Wanderfull experience! Best position, near the metro, and great team.Beautiful Hotel with many comfort. I receved many attention for my birthday, it was unforgetable.I hope we will back soon. :-))))"
Apr 2016,50,Good service and comfortable room,I stay in Corinthia Hotel Lisbon for 4 days 3 nights and I feel very comfortable and relax while I stay in this Hotel just like home. I highly recommend you to stay in this Hotel no matter travel or business trip.
Apr 2016,50,Excellent hotel,"À great team that makes your holiday perfectClose to Subway and train station. Excellent breakfast, with plenty of choise.Clean pleasant room. Very friendly en helpful staff. We Will be backA real winner."
Apr 2016,50,Amazing stay,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, 3 days as a family while visiting Lisbon with our 2 young boys.  I can't say enough wonderful things, from the staff, room, pool/spa, restaurants/food.  Everyone was so friendly and accommodating. We stayed at 3 different hotels while visiting Portugal, and this was by far our favorite. Highly recommend for all travelers."
Apr 2016,50,Best time ever,"this was my first time been in a hotel,but it was perfect i love it every bit of and I'm sure I'm coming back again.and for sure I'm going to recommend this hotel to my friend and family,and the stuff were so polite."
Apr 2016,20,Not happy,"Stayed here for 4 nights with my daughter and grand son of 2 years old.There is nothing to do for children. we stayed in an Executive junior suite which was very nice, we also had the use of the Executive lounge which was nice.We were never told much about the lounge, like we could have ordered food from the room service menu.  so we use to eat in our room.Our plates at breakfast time were not cleaned away and we had to eat with piles of dirty dishes. It  seemed that the waiters picked and chose who they were going to be helpful to.The guest relation ladies up stairs were lovely and very nice.More things happen and when I went down stairs to the guest relation desk to tell them, the lady on the desk appeared not to have cared.Defiantly not going back"
Apr 2016,50,Great hotel,"Excellent service, breakfast buffet offers great variety and excellent quality. Executive Lounge with a great team that makes you feel welcome as a guest. Hotel is close to Metro and train station. Airport Bus #2 stops at Sete Rios."
Apr 2016,50,Lovely hotel,We stayed here for two nights over the Easter break and loved the hotel. We were offered an upgrade at check-in for extra cost but it was well worth it. The room was huge and the bed one of the best I've ever slept in. The hotel is not in the historic centre but really neat the metro station so it is not an inconvenient. Really good value quality hotel. Would definitely go again.
Apr 2016,50,Perfect place to stay in Lisbon,"Excellent in every aspect. Quality, location and accessibility were perfect and would definitely recommend to anyone planning a visit to Lisbon. The friendliness and professionalism of all the staff was of the highest order."
Apr 2016,40,Good stay in Lisbon,"We had a bumpy start in this hotel due to a mix up over rooms but thanks to Monica in the executive lounge it was sorted out and we enjoyed our stay.  The hotel is a little way out of the centre but it is two minutes from the blue metro line so you are in the centre within 20 minutes.Our room was a good size and had lovely Espa toiletries, our only (small) complaint was the room was very warm. We reported this to reception but the air conditioning didn't get any better.Daniel in the sky lounge was fantastic at looking after us, he like Monica is a credit to the hotel. It's a shame that not all staff have the same approach, the woman on the executive check in desk on the ground floor and the woman in the spa reception were both disinterested to the point of rudeness.  A shame as I wanted to use the spa facilities but was put off because of her attitude. Lisbon is a lovely city and we would happily stay here again."
Apr 2016,40,Distance from centre no issue,"I tend to use Hilton on most trips (especially making use of the lounge) but didn't fancy the Doubletree in the city.I opted for the Corinthia (although I felt I was taking a risk), but it was well worth it.  I booked an executive room with lounge access, and the price was extremely good for the level of service received.  I must compliment all of the staff I encountered during my stay, the service was excellent.The room was ok, a mix of old and new and a decent view of the city.Access was easy, local trains and buses more or less outside of the hotel.In all honesty, this was as good, and in some ways better than the regular Hilton product of which I use regularly."
Apr 2016,40,Large room and nice service,"We booked a junior suite for a five night stay recently.  The room was quite large.  The bathroom had a nice feature that kept the mirror from fogging.  The furniture and linens were well maintained.  Our maid was exceptional, spending extra time to tidy up our things, whether computer cables or shirts left out.  We also liked that the hotel put a chocolate on our pillows every night and not just the first night.The hotel is located next to a train and metro station, which make Sintra or downtown Lisbon very convenient.The breakfast was quite good.  We liked the omelette station. As a tip, you can ask for a cappuccino! I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone."
Apr 2016,40,One night stay,"Stayed here for one night as we had an early flight next morning. Staff were very friendly and helpful. A welcoming hotel were children are also welcomed. Lobby was beautiful, bar service very good also rooms and beds very comfortable. Overall a very pleasant experience. Will stay again. Look out for sales on the hotel website, great deals to be had."
Apr 2016,40,Very comfortable Hotel.,I have been staying at this Hotel for years. It is a very comfortable and convenient hotel for me. Staff are very kind and helpful. Breakfast has very good quality and a wide range of choices. It is a shame they do not have dry muesli without added sugar and salt as well as fruits of the forest.
Mar 2016,40,Nice Hotel,The hotel is a nice hotel. Quite busy. Prefer taking a Executive room which has access to the sky lounge. You can have a quiet breakfast in the lounge or have a more vast breakfast at the lobby level. You can spend a quite evening with a complementary drink in the lounge. The rooms are a little small in size. The lady sitting on the reception of the lounge and the concierge were quite helpful.
Mar 2016,40,Good Hotel,About 10 mins from the airport and approx 10 Euro ride.The hotel is big and busy.Check-in and Check -Out can be very slow at peak times.The magnetic room cards are also the ones you use for the lifts -- a bit tricky to get used but fine after that.The concierge and doormen were very friendly and informative.The bar area and staff are wonderful and a lovely part of the hotel to relax after a day of sight seeing.The customer services desk was largely fronted by a couple of young ladies and when I first visited them on our first night they seemed to have the giggles and to be honest I wasn't sure whether they were laughing at me or something else but I found it very disconcerting and I didn't bother going back there again.The bedrooms are modern and in good order .Breakfast was okay without being exceptional --- being a vegetarian I wish they'd had a few more options.The area around the hotel is dotted with restaurants and shops so its quite interesting to venture out for walks.There is nearly always a full rank of taxis outside the hotel so that is very convenient.Taxis in Lisbon are cheap and plentiful and i personally would recommend them for going to the tourist sites rather than the Metro.Overall a very good hotel and apart from the guest services desk very well staffed.
Mar 2016,50,Great stay in lisboa,Fantastic hotel with a extremely effektive team Breakfast outstanding. Near  bus station for travelling to the country side.Near AirPort Takes less than 15 minutters by a taxi which is cheap in wonderful Lisboa!!!
Mar 2016,50,Very enjoyable stay,"This is an all round great hotel which was perfect for business and as I would expect from the brand. Hotel staff were exceptionally friendly, helping with local places and restaurants to visit (whilst not disappointing)."
Mar 2016,40,Nice hotel,I was very satisfied will almost everything except the TV. TV had some very strange system built in which made handling very user unfriendly and offered no interesting channels in other languages that Portuguese. Common TV with satellite which is usually found in cheap hotels would be much better than this.
Mar 2016,40,good assistance,A mirror in good position to use airdryer will be necessary . Temperature in bedroom was too high.Sofas in breakfast room are very dirty and probably  old dated and considering the cost of breakfat..... However mainly our experience was good. To recommed
Mar 2016,40,Corinthia Lisboa,"I've stayed here since 2006 over and over again, for business and for leisure. if you want top service you must book their Executive club rooms. Their service is the best in town! If you stay there and have any question regarding your stay, please ask for Daniel, he is the hidden gem of the Corinthia Hotel executive club!"
Mar 2016,50,Very nice experience,"The hotel is not too far from the center (10' tube) and the hotel is great. Swimming pool, fitness, everyone is kind, good standing, and french speakers. We stayed 4 days/ 3 nights I recommand this hotel"
Mar 2016,50,Well worthy of 5 stars,"This is a fine hotel, well worthy of its 5 stars. The rooms and beds are excellent, the staff friendly and very helpful, and there is a useful carpark. The essential wi-fi worked well. The water was hot for a shower. The air-conditioning was great.Looking for a downside, the lifts can be very busy at times."
Mar 2016,40,"perfect Hotel for visiting Lisbon. Excellent reception, organization, relaxation at the Spa","5 * reception, valet service, concierge service to help organize your city touring, Nice Bar for snacks for lunch and drinks with piano player entertainment in the evening. Restaurant OK. Nice but not too big rooms. Only negative point was no separate toilet Try the very good seafood Restaurant across the street!"
Mar 2016,50,very good hotel,"excellent place to stay and tour the city of Lisbon, staff is very helpful and friendly, only 5 min walk to the Metro station and 15 min to downtown Lisbon, breakfast buffet is great, also to have dinner in the restaurant makes your day"
Mar 2016,50,"For me, too far from the center but otherwise perfect",We had originally booked the Interconti but due to constrution works were re-booked here. Personally I like to stay a bit more central but of course there's nothing the hotel can do about it.Otherwise everything was top notch. We were given a very nice room up top with beautiful views of the city and a super comfy and very big bed. Breakfast and Evening Canapés at the club lounge were both very good although some of the staff there were a little grumpy while others were super friendly. And again: very nice view.
Mar 2016,50,Perfect place to stay,"Worth every of those 5* - especially on the executive floor; super service, spotless rooms, pampered by staff, couldn't be a better place to enjoy one's stay in Lisbon, close to public transportation and therefore very convenient"
Mar 2016,50,Amazing hotel,"Amazing Hotel,  I liked Everything:)The Room the Food The Hotel were Excellent and very Beautiful!I will come back for sure to stay more Days:)I will reccomend the Hotel to Everybody because i had Great time.Thank you again"
Mar 2016,50,Amazing hotel in great location,We had actually booked another four star hotel that we found to be very very dirty so we didn't check in I and knew of this five star hotel and as it was Christmas we thought that we would treat ourselves.  We had a Junior Suite and it was a huge room with panoramic views. Very comfortable with chairs and a sofa. One of the best rooms for comfort that we have stayed in. We stayed for nine nights and my husband had to do some work in the room during the day. The bad news is that like many hotels the heating is not turned on during the day. All of the staff are attentive and the service was excellent. There is secure parking at the hotel but there is also parking on the street that is free depending of the time of day. In front of the restaurant is Sete Rios restaurant. It does look much from the outside but is one of the best seafood restaurants in Lisboa. We ate in the hotel restaurant once and the food was good but expensive. I am Portuguese and we have family nearby and we only ate at the hotel for convenience. The breakfast is fantastic and the service really good. We like good coffee and the restaurant manage always recognised us in the morning and sent a waiter off to make it for us (as opposed to using the automatic machines for guests). Can't recommend the hotel enough. It is also next to a metro station and it is just a short trip to the centre. If there are three of you it is better to go by taxi. We have already returned for another visit since Christmas and wouldn't stay anywhere else in Lisboa.
Mar 2016,50,First Time,We enjoyed the staff and the location was very confortable. Rooms were clean and the breakfast was excellent. thanks for all travelling advice and dinner suggestions. We stayed at 16 floor and the skyline was breath taking
Mar 2016,40,Good experience,"We had a weekend off and decided to visit Lisbone for the first time.At the Corinthia Hotel.The hotel is located few minutes from the city center, near by a metro station.The communication with the guest service before our arrival was efficient and helpful, I have contacted the hotel to inform themOf our arrival on the late morning and our room was already available as expected.The check in was fast and helpful with useful information abour the best spots to visit in Lisbone.The room was comfortable as the bed, I only suggest to give included with the toilet forniture toothbrush and past, is the minimun if it pretends to be a 5* hotel.  I use to travel often and working in tourism enviroment and I can say that the room was clean properly. The breakfast has a wide range of selection of cold and hot options. Can't complain about that. We had a good experience with the service at the hotel bar. I would suggest to ask a room on the top floor. In general has been a positive experience and good value quality/price.Would I go back? Yes, why not."
Mar 2016,50,First class treatment ,Sitting in the executive lounge in my last evening in this magnificent hotel. Room was outstanding. . Cleaned twice a day by the staff. We upgraded to the executive lounge where we enjoyed refreshments all day. The staff provided excellent service. This chain of hotel is outstanding.Hotel a little oylut of city but right next to metro station and also a lot of decent restaurant's in walking distance. 5star from me
Mar 2016,50,"Great Location, Excellent Accommodation","This hotel is in an ideal location as it is so close to the Metro (Zoological Gardens) and the rail station (Sete Rose). It is clean and the superior room is well equipped with very comfortable beds,tea/coffee making facilities (mugs instead of cups .. big plus!).  Both the bathroom and bedroom are spacious. Good wardrobe space with plenty of hangers and a safe provided. The pool is a nice addition.. small so don't expect to be doing any lengths! but it is a nice retreat.The staff are pleasant and very helpful. Would recommend for any kind of visit to Lisbon as within easy reach from the airport and easy to access all parts of Lisbon and beyond. Train to Sintra can be got at Sete Rose or head on the metro to Cais de Sord for the trains to the coastal areas. You can also reach within metres of the hotel on the metro from the airport with just one change of line.(from the red to the blue).Recommend this hotel highly."
Mar 2016,40,Stopover due to flight delay,"Pleasant two nights stay marred by poor service on checkout.Receptionist insisted that the one hundred euros charged to my Mastercard on booking in had been credited back,requesting me to settle the final account in full.I assured her that I had checked my Master card online and the credit had not been received.Two days on still not received."
Mar 2016,40,"Peaceful location, so close to the centre","We enjoyed the stay. Staff was very friendly, all of them! We asked for early check as we arrived at 9 in the morning. This was no problem at all.  Rooms were clean, a bit on the small side. Excellent bed."
Mar 2016,50,very good vacation,"I really impress with Corinthia hotel very good food, very good service, accommodation excellent the only thing they don't have much option its the tv channel they have to provide more English channel for the guest I hope the hotel look on this problem..."
Mar 2016,50,fabulous,"Great room, breakfast and gym! Watch out to make sure you have a swimming cap for the pool - we didn't and had to buy them. V quick trip into the centre of town. Also, fab little restaurants around the hotel that are less touristy than those in the centre."
Mar 2016,50,Exceptionally good stay.,"We would highly recommend the Corinthia hotel in Lisbon. The facilities were excellent including the swimming pool. Everything went smoothly from booking in to out, the thing that struck us most were the competent staff who were not only efficient but smiley and friendly. We do not speak Portuguese but the this was no handicap as all staff spoke some English. Sadly our English hotels on the whole are not as good in their care for guests and they are more expensive! Some might prefer a hotel nearer the centre but we did not find this a problem.Lisbon is a city well worth a visit with a lot to see and do. Our only difficulty was working out the metro ticket machines."
Mar 2016,40,"Lovely hotel, but some updates needed.","The rooms are very comfortable and the staff lovely, but it is looking a bit dated and I would not give 5 stars to it as it stands. I'm not sure if repairs are ongoing but the exposed wiring in both wardrobe and desk were slightly concerning. Food is delightful and the breakfast selection is outstanding. Meeting rooms are spacious but looking a bit worse for wear. An attempt to recarpet appears to have gone horribly wrong in at least one of them and bulges and bits glued haphazardly together make it a bit of a trip hazard. Prior to checkout I asked twice if I could leave my bag in the room to be brought down. I was assured it would be fine, but when I was ready to leave, my bag was nowhere to be found. Eventually it was located. Still in my room."
Mar 2016,40,Quite nice overall,"Room spacious and comfortable. A true 5-star but not pricey. Metro and train station 3 mins walk only and is visible from the entrance of the hotel. This effectively compensates its slightly off city centre location. Bathroom a bit 70s though, so as the inconvenient location of plugs Renovation in that necessary in my judgement."
Mar 2016,50,Perfect vacation,"I felt re born after three nights in this hotel. The comfort and the food and the customer service... PERFECT. The best two things: the quality of the bed, and the breakfast. Position is good: go to the zoo, few meters next to the hotel, and to the commercial centre Colombo."
Mar 2016,50,Excellent hotel loved our stay,"This hotel is fantastic,so efficient and polite.We stayed in an executive room with access to the executive lounge and had the attention of Daniel a most amazing waiter.Access to the metro is only just across the road,and 6 euros gives you unlimited travel all over Lisbon for one day.Nearby shopping malls are great,not to add travelling on the yellow trams was really interesting. We are re booking again in September and can't wait to return."
Mar 2016,50,Excellent Choice for Leisure Break,"Excellent standard of accommodation,  breakfast food and evening buffet was excellent. Customer service was excellent too. Ease of access to local attractions. Metro on the doorstep, Airlink bus stops right outside the hotel, taxi rank outside front of hotel. The open top tour buses pass the back of the hotel every 20 minutes - would recommend the yellow bus includes buses and trams in cost of ticket."
Mar 2016,50,First visit to Lissabon,"Very nice hotel with everything you need. It is located in a business area away from the City but it is easy to get there by Metro. There are not so many places to eat in the area. The fitness room is ok, but if you are going to use the pool you need to wear are svimmingcap so we didn't use the pool. The wifi is excellent. The employers are very helpful. The rooms are very nice, comfatable bed, Big bathroom and complimentary tea and coffee."
Mar 2016,40,excellent hotel -,"this hotel is really  well located close to metro stationvery easy access to downtown and to visit all the city of LIsbonnepersonnal of the hotel is very friendly and at your serviceNo doubt, we will come back"
Mar 2016,50,Great Stay in Lisboa,"This hotel is top notch, centrally located, fab amenities (full service spa, multiple restaurants, stylish bar, gym, pool etc.) When you book a Jr. suite or better you are granted access to the Corinthia lounge. This is well worth the room rate, not to mention who doesn't like two bathrooms in their hotel room?! I know I do! The lounge is open around the clock and offers complimentary snacks, appetizers, cocktails, beers, dessert. In the mornings the have a chef that will make you whatever you want for breakfast, for free! The also have computers, couches to lounge on and views of Lisbon from the 24 floor. It's quite a treat to see the bridges, historic aqueducts and the bustling city from the comfort of the lounge. We will definitely be staying here again when we're back in the fall."
Mar 2016,30,Service was very good but...,"This is a tourist hotel not really a business like but away of any action. Funny elevators.The suite had a view to the distant river. Carpeting was stained in the living room and in the bedroom. The desk is uncomfortable to work and TV in the bedroom is small.The tiles in the bathroom also had multiple stains which I complained to housekeeping, they promptly came and I could see that those stains could not come out.I had a problem in connecting my laptop to the TV and engineer did not give up until he made it work even changing TVs. My applauses to him.The executive lounge had  good service and a chef preparing good eggs. Regarding food, the pesto pasta was terrible on room service and restaurant just reasonable. Again people were nice.Porters were really quick in picking up my car.On the fifth day I asked for a 3PM check being offered a 1PM... Kidding? That was really stupid. The hotel is of course not the Ritz but was pretty close to my office reason why I decided to try it.So, rooms are stained, service is good and management in view of the 1PM check out for a customer staying 5 nights, not good"
Mar 2016,40,VERY GOOD,just stayed for 4 nights & the room 1422 was very goodLarge bed & bathroom & was kept very cleanWe had breakfast every day & was also very good with a large selection on offer the only problem we had was the hotel was full of students on a trip & the restaurant was fullWe had the buffet meal one night & for the price was very good
Mar 2016,30,Good hotel let down by Reception,"We were kept waiting over two hours for our suite and we then deposited in a smoking suite on the smoking floor (15). We eventually ended up on the 3rd floor with a glorious view on the flat roof over Reception. With one exception, the Reception staff were unhelpful and dismissive in sorting out our reservation. Its a shame, this is a good hotel."
Mar 2016,50,Absolute Luxury,Stayed here for 5 nights on a city break with a friend and could not fault anything about the hotel or it's staff. We booked the executive club and I could not recommend it highly enough for those that want that 5 star service or for those who don't want to have kids running around at breakfast times!The staff in the executive club could not do enough to help and when I mentioned that the window in our room had leaked during the night when there was torrential rain we were moved immediately-we didn't even know it had happened as they did everything for us whilst we were out.
Mar 2016,50,Nice stay druing the business trip,"Very comfortable hotel for business trips. It is located near to the airport (only 15 minutes away). The standard room was quite nice, the view was also impressive (to the old aqueduct). The breakfast offered a really wide range of tasty dishes to choose from. In general I am very satisfied with the conditions."
Mar 2016,50,Great 5 stars hotel in Lisbon,"I stayed at Corinthia Hotel last November for a 2-days business meeting in Lisbon and I enjoyed the stay. The hotel is a bit far from city center but however it is well connected with Metro and Bus system. Staff was very helpful. A particular mention for the breakfast: it's a bit expensive but it's worth it because it was really fantastic! If you have to come back during the late evening or the night, take a taxi it's the best solution to me because the area around the hotel is a bit isolated."
Mar 2016,40,Excellent Hotel for both business and leisure.,Stay here every month. As usual it is always a great experience staying at the Corinthia. The atmosphere and people welcome you and pamper you. The breakfast is 5 star as well as the dining. The location of the Corithia is situated strategically close to the airport and all other areas of interest with in the city.
Mar 2016,40,My Stay at Corinthia,"It was a very good 4 nights that I stay at Corinthia, and the Hotel wasn't fare from the many facilities.Also the staff they where so welcome and helpful. I will chose this Hotel for my next stay at Lisbon."
Mar 2016,20,Poor food and facilities,"Decent location on the edge of the city.Staff friendly but forgetful.Cleanliness was good.Meeting facilities were average.Cofee machines in the comon space between meeting facilities were shut down between official coffee breaks - why is anyones guess.The food was awful at all meals in all restaturants.Portugal has beautiful food - this hotel does not.The AC in the room did not work.There was music playing in the batchroom which could not be turned completely off - very annoying.There is a complex system in place for calling elevators. As a consequence, when 150 people at a conference all need to take the elevator at the same time, waiting time is 10 minutes.If you do not plan to eat there and get a very good deal on the price, it is a decent hotel, albeit not 5 star quaity."
Mar 2016,50,Excellent hotel with great staff,"We were a group of 7 people who stayed here for 4 nights in March. We had booked executive rooms. The rooms were comfortable, the washroom very nice, shower was excellent with nice toiletries. The bed was comfortable and there nesxpresso in the room along with ironing board, safe etc.... The breakfast was sumptuous and very varied. We being vegetarian had ample choice to fill our stomachs. He highlight of the stay was the executive lounge on the top floor. For executive guests, the lounge had free access and there was wines and beer and tea coffee served all day long along savories like cake, dry fruits, breads, cheese etc..... The lounge was very nice with business table and chairs... The lounge has PC and printers for use with free Internet. Even though the room in Executive class were a bit small, the lounge was amazing. I would highly recommend this hotel to any business traveler and to family as well. They had a full fledged spa and gym as well which is also nice. The hotel is located close to the airport and the metro station is located just across the street...."
Mar 2016,50,Amazing hotel for a stay in Lisbon,"I booked this hotel for a 3 night stay as a getaway present for my Mum, and we both could not recommend the hotel enough. From the minute we got to the hotel, we were greeted by both friendly and helpful concierges and receptionists, who were quick to hand over all the information we would need on exploring Lisbon. We stayed on the 6th floor (602), in a lovely, bright, spacious room. The bathroom is huge and even plays music, nice little touch. The room has all the amenities you need and housekeeping were more than happy to replenish these when we needed. One quick mention for Paulo who helped us get up to the room quicker when we got stuck behind a tour group waiting for the elevators, he was an absolute star! We didn't eat at the hotel for dinner, but every morning the breakfasts were great. There's such a huge spread from traditional Portuguese pasties, fresh fruit, meats and cheeses, waffles and of course fresh cooked breakfast. The breakfast staff are quick and efficient, and you'll never have an empty coffee cup! We spent one late evening in the lounge bar after returning from the city, where a great pianist plays for you. He's very talented (worth a listen in the evenings) and very friendly. Miguel from the bar (and we didn't catch the other bartenders name) but they were both lovely and friendly, a credit to the hotel. They even introduced us to the traditional Portuguese liqueurs. Check out was quick and easy, and the hotel were happy to keep our bags for the day as we had an evening flight home. We would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Lisbon, and we really do hope we will be back soon! Thanks to all at the Hotel Corinthia"
Mar 2016,50,Just in time,"Everythings has been delivered at right time in the right sites, wherever I expected to be, and by kind and professional peolple;One suggestion: room maids should be able to speak basic English, and was not in my experience.Thanks"
Mar 2016,40,my stay in Corinthia,"Corinthia hotel is a very good structure and staff is very kind.the only weakness is breakfats for people suffering intolerances, in matter of variety of menu.the business area was well organised and the room are good even if the temperature was pretty high"
Mar 2016,50,"Perfect location, beautiful hotel, friendly efficient staff","Lovely hotel, rooms spacious and well equipped, very close to the metro, only three stops from the HUGE Columbus shopping mall, the staff friendly and very helpful, hotel is ideally located for exploring the city, Lisbon a beautiful city, looking forward to visiting again"
Mar 2016,40,Excellent hotel but be prepared to pay for extras,"The hotel was great, rooms lovely, staff very helpful.  We didn't eat in the hotel, as we thought it was very expensive.  There is a fantastic little cafe for breakfast just a few doors along and a couple of other very good restaurants that we ate dinner in.Location is great with the subway just two minutes away and buses stopping there too.  Easy to get where you want to go.The swimming pool etc was a bit of a disappointment.  You are not allowed in without a swimming hat so they charge you for that.  Then the spa area was an additional 20Euros per person for 2 hours (I think that's right).  We thought this was a lot and even more so when we got in to find one area closed as it wasn't working.  We complained and were given free passes to use the spa again the next day, which was excellent customer service.  The spa was very nice indeed and the changing rooms etc. were very nice too.  Treatments (massage etc) were very expensive so we didn't have any of those.Lovely hotel but be prepared to pay for things you might not expect to and read the small print carefully to check what is included."
Mar 2016,50,Lisbon,"This was our second visit to the Corinthia in Lisbon. It is very well sited for all the main tourist facilities and also for a visit to Sintra. The hotel is very large, but never feels too busy and the staff have time to chat and offer advise on things to see in Lisbon. It is only 15 minutes from Lisbon ariport.We have visited several Corintia hotels now and like the relaxed comfort and good standards."
Mar 2016,50,Business trip,"Excellent Hotel with ALL perfectly set-up. Clean ,great restaurant, perfect rooms, Gym & pool. I recommend it for any kind of trip (business, pleasure). All that at the right rate ! 10min far by the airport. 15min from down town."
Mar 2016,50,"Better than a 4, but not quite a 5.","My family and I booked an executive junior suite and a connected executive twin room. Without going into great detail, despite a confirmation email reiterating the same, our specific room types were not available upon check-in, and would not be available until the next day. So, we had some issues during our stay. Let me lay out the good and the not-so-good...Good: The hotel is very nice, very modern, very clean and looks as though it should be a 5 star property. The bellmen are helpful and pleasant. The housekeeping crew is friendly and hard working.The spa is clean. The gym is well-equipped and spacious. The pool is delightful.The executive lounge staff is excellent! (They went way above and beyond what would be expected of a hotel to help celebrate our daughter's birthday) The breakfast and other meals in the lounge were well done. The server, Daniel, and both omelette chefs were superb. Sandra, Rute and the others did great as well. When we had issues, Sandra and the rest of the staff did their best to resolve them and to keep their guests happy,The executive junior suite was spacious and nicely furnished. The bed was, without a doubt, the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. I would replace our home bed in a heartbeat, but it was a Portugese brand and not available where we live. The bathroom has a heated section of mirror, so when you get out of the hot shower...you can still see! Awesome!Fast, free, strong Wi-Fi was available throughout the whole hotel.OK, so here are the not-so-goods (All of these were brought to the hotel's attention and it seemed as if they genuinely cared about the issues):There is clearly a disconnect with the front office if guaranteed rooms are not available upon check-in, and guests would have to stay in other rooms for one night and then move the next day. Despite a guaranteed 1PM check-in (with email confirmation), the front desk staff told us repeatedly that check-in was at 2PM.Room service: Sandra comped us a room service dinner because of the room mix-up (very generous). That meal cost €150, and had we paid for it, we would have been upset. The food was not great. They didn't bring the six-year-old's meal until 30 minutes later (Everyone else was done eating). Room service was difficult to reach and they frequently didn't answer the phone. Comfort: Like many ""green"" hotels, guests are not allowed to individually control the temperature of their room. Because the hotel determines that it is ""heating time,"" not ""A/C time,"" all guestrooms are forced to use heat or use nothing. That is of course, unless you're in a public area of the hotel. It seems the A/C still works there. This is a huge pet peeve and causes discomfort to guests.Bathroom: Despite the fact that the hair dryers are provided by the hotel, they do not work in the bathroom outlets. Guests are forced to use the hair dryer at the desk, or sitting on the floor by the front door. Neither location has a mirror. Another thing about the bathroom, there is zero counter space. No room at all to even place an average sized bathroom bag on the counter, let alone two.Tipico Restaurant: Due to tired kids and bad weather, we decided to eat dinner Friday at the restaurant on the ground level, ""Tipico."" We were 1 of only 7 tables occupied in the restaurant. There were two servers, and most of the tables were eating the buffet (€30 p/p). We ordered three kids meals, an entree and a salad. The total was around €50. When the server brought our check, it was for €160. Clearly it belonged to another table. Simply looking at it before giving it to us and walking away would have avoided that situation.Spa: The sauna, steam and hamam were closed until April. Like others on TA, we were not informed. Not that it would have been a deal-breaker, but it would be nice to inform guests before hand, especially when touting the spa services as ""included"" in the executive rates.Summary - This place has the potential to be a 5 star property, but some details need to be addressed. The executive lounge service was superb and if the hotel could be run by the 5-6 employees up there, I'm sure the whole place would be stellar. Until that happens, It's a 4. The only reason I gave it a 5 on TA is because of how receptive the hotel was to the criticism. (I wasn't even going to complain, but they insisted that I tell them if we had any issues while we were checking out.)"
Mar 2016,50,Best one,Thank you Corinthia it was amazing time to holiday. Hopefully we will back to you. And service is really nice. My partner is happy that I chose your hotel. Breakfast and dinner tasting very good. Thank you
Mar 2016,50,Michael & Jeanette Payton,Cab Service was convient quick and the price not much higher than using the metro.  The location is excellent.  We were extremely impress with the professional attitude of the staffand the friendly atmosphere that is very prevalent at the Corinthia Hotel of Lisbon.  I would suggest you add the Executive Lounge package to your reservation.
Mar 2016,50,Fabulous hotel,Friendly and very helpfull staff. Very nice views from the higher floors. Excellent breakfast. We will certainly come back when visiting Lisbon the next time. Metro and train station just around the corner.
Mar 2016,40,One man let it down,"This is a lovely hotel and well appointed. All public areas are spacious & clean and the rooms clean & comfortable. Just one thing let it down. I called for room service and was dealt with by a very rude, belligerent man. If it hadn't been that I was so hungry I would have terminated the call! All other staff were very friendly and welcoming."
Mar 2016,50,weekend break,"Arrived at the hotel quite late on a sat night, we were promptly checked in and shown to the lifts, the room was an executive suite, which has a separate sitting room and bedroom, and a very comfortable king sized bed, the decor of the room is a bit old school business hotel style but comfortable, ( I did find the carpet looking bit grubby and some stains) an upgrade to the rooms/bathrooms to a level that matched the decor of the executive lounge,(smart, modern, contemporary) would make this hotel top notch. The executive lounge was a great asset to our weekend, great breakfast there on the Sunday morning, drinks in the evening before heading out to dinner, snacks etc. Everyone we meet was very friendly and attentive, look forward to a return."
Mar 2016,40,Week in Lisbon,"Hotel was welcoming, friendly and with good services.Convenient for the airport and the metro.Staff were polite and helpful.Room was large and comfortable with nice views towards Lisbon, the bridge and aquaduct."
Mar 2016,50,Another good stay at the Corinthia,"Third stay at this hotel for leisure break. Excellent room (junior suite) with lovely views, good breakfast, good service.  Opposite Metro station for easy access to all parts of the city and also opposite Sete-Rios train station where we took a train to Sintra and one to Setubal. Would stay again on another visit to Lisbon."
Mar 2016,50,Birthday Treat,"My wife treated us to a 3 night stay in a junior suite, the room was lovely we were up on the 19th floor, great views over Lisbon,2 minute walk to the zoo and less than 5 to the metro system.Food was very good, service always with a smile, will return again."
Mar 2016,50,Great hotel ,"Visited Lisbon recently and stayed at this lovely hotel , rooms were spacious and comfortable with separate work area and lounge , staff were friendly , hotel was extremely clean well presented and looked after , I would recommend this hotel if your in the area on business and it's right next to the zoo and metro stations so great transport links ."
Mar 2016,10,No Air Conditioning,"The temperature in the room was unbearable, putting the air conditioning on only increased the overall temperature. I had to call the front desk 4 times to get assistance and 45 minutes later, 2 fans later, we were able to open a window and set up a working fan."
Mar 2016,50,My wonderful stay,I stayed at your wonderful hotel as I was working on the Pfizer Conference. It was hard workbut the comfort and kindness and wonderful service I received made it easier. Thank youfor looking after me.
Mar 2016,50,Trip to Lsbon,This hotel was excellent. Very convenient for access to city centre.  Staff very helpful. Would definitely stay here again. Only problem was aqua spa was closed for renovations and we would love to spend time there after our treatments.
Mar 2016,10,Disgusting,"I arrive at 11.30 to a room which is a health hazard in terms of temperature. 3 times staff tell me a technician is on his way and that's a lie. Then they tell me air conditioning doesn't work in winter. No service, manager also doesn't have decency to move me to another room or fix the problem. Will not be staying here again. Would leave now if it wasn't midnight. They bring me a fan and guess what that doesn't work. This hotel is a joke."
Mar 2016,40,Weekend in Lisbon,"Booked an executive suite for a weekend break, the room is spacious, separate lounge with a guest toilet, we went downstairs to the tempus bar the bar staff were really friendly, the next morning we had breakfast in the executive lounge, great spread of food, and great coffee. The hotel is really close to the metro and we used that to get into town and back. Nice hotel, if the rooms were as modern and smart as the executive lounge they would be amazing."
Feb 2016,50,Excellent hotel,Excellent service very close to airport and city only disappointment is stems and Sona not working...staff and service is very good... Highley recommend to anyone who like to visit LisbonView from the room also very good
Feb 2016,50,Wonderful hotel,"Clean, spacious and Best of all helpful staff and great facilities. The fitness center was clean and spacious. Breakfast buffet was wonderful. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff was helpful and filled with smiles. Enjoyed our three days"
Feb 2016,50,Superb service!,"Never before have we stayed at such a lovely hotel where the staff and service was amazing prior, during and also after our stay. We felt welcomed even beforeour arrival and missed when leaving. Highly recommended!"
Feb 2016,40,Consistent,I have stayed many times at the hotel for business and always find the staff pleasant and helpful.   however having been for going for 2 years the menus have not really changed and it would be good to have a few specials.     The room temperature as in many hotels is switched to heat from Oct to April ish and unfortunately given the climate now this makes the rooms uncomfortable as you are not able set this to cool and it is too noisy to have the windows open.  The day time temperature during my last visit end of Feb was 18/19.   If you are a lady I would advise asking for extension lead as the hair dryer socket is not near a mirror and it has a coiled lead making it very difficult to dry hair.   Again this is common mistake made by many hotels.
Feb 2016,50,Corinthia the beste,"it was yhe 2nd time in the Corinthia. It was again a pleasure. very good hotel, friendly staff and the view of the rooms is incredible! If you go, book a executive room. Than you can acces de executive lounge for breakfast and thei is again the view, it is a really nice way to wake up1"
Feb 2016,20,No 5 Star Hotel for sure,"Corintha Hotel may HAVE been a 5 star Hotel , but for sure is not that I would rate it as a 3 Star Hotel. What differs a 5 Star to a 3 Star IMO. to start with things work at a 5 Star Hotel. Example in the Spa / Pool the Jacuzzi was out of order as well as the Sauna, and obviously the hot water to the ONLY shower before entering the pool, no locker rooms. Yes we stayed in a standard double room but I've been to so may Hotels during my life so I know a well run Hotel by the details or lack of attending to detail.I honestly think that most reviewers have actually not stayed at the Hotel. What is good at the Hotel is the WiFi in the room as well as 200m only from the Metro, but it is located in an area outside of the city so there is nothing within walking distance."
Feb 2016,50,Everything compensate the location,Excellent hotel. A good five stars hotel. Big rooms with a small living room in and big bathrooms according to the size of the room. It has a big lobby with lot of places to wait for the others. Staff is friendly and helpful. It has a very good gym with new machines and a very nice indoor swimming pool. It has a spa also but we didn´t use. It has a good restaurant which we used. The price is very accessible for a 5 star hotel and the only con that you could find is the location which is a little far from the places of interest though there is public transportation near. The quality of the hotel compensate by far being a little far.
Feb 2016,50,Fantastic staff fantastic hotel,Stayed over a weekend and we were very pleased with this hotel Staff were very friendly and attentive upgraded to an executive queen and got access to the sky lounge this was very good brilliant views our breakfast from the 24th floor could not fault anything and possibly the comfiest bed iv every slept in The hotel is located about 5 minutes drive from the main tourist areas around 7 euros by taxi or via the metro located opposite the hotelHighly recommend hotel and hope we get the opportunity to return
Feb 2016,40,"Good stay, a thing about communication.","I thought I would treat myself and my Azorian friend to a pleasant environment in Lisbon, it was just that. A lovely room on the 17th floor and yes they will authorize your card so what? The lifts were a great reminder to carry your key card. You just want to select your floor but you stand there. Great fun. The room was spotless and the robes very fluffy. Bed was great as was the bathroom, plus the toiletries were of a high standard. The downer was that I said to my friend hey we are celebrating so lets go to the aqua area for relaxation alas no its closed, no-one told us. At check in or by email. Bar scene was pleasant and if they mess up your bill you will get an e-mail saying we have charged your card even though you have asked at check out that the bill was a bit light. So yes a pleasant stay .Located good if you arrive by train to sete rios and by the way uber is qualified in Lisbon unlike the the doorman said."
Feb 2016,50,"Great room + hotel facilities, Excellent value, well connected to the city",We were in Lisbon on holiday for 4 nights. The hotel was extremely good value - nice rooms and gym/pool facilities. 20min journey to city centre - very accessible. Only issue was room temperature which we struggled to control.
Feb 2016,50,Amazing Hotel!,"We were staying in Lisbon for a few nights and I contacted the hotel in advance to book a restaurant for our anniversary.  They immediately responded to my request, gave me several great options and booked the reservation.  When we arrived the hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  We were surprised when we checked into our room that they delivered champagne and strawberries as a courtesy along with a card congratulating us on our one year anniversary.  We only have great things to say about the amazing service, attention to detail and cleanliness of this hotel.  It was a little out of the way from the city centre, but still easy to get around.  Great experience!!!"
Feb 2016,30,Some nice touches but room style was very old,"The positives - breakfast, great spread and cooked to order.  Friendly, approachable staff and all facilities that anyone could need to have a great stay.The negatives - rooms look and feel very out of date, air conditioning did not work and was set to hot (explained reception staff after maintenance said far to hot in here open the window) so room was far too hot and window had to be opened all the time.  Check in was a bit slow, 20 minutes until seen to but not end of the World.  The location was away from the main, interesting parts of Lisbon but taxis are so cheap it does not really matter.  Close to metro.Overall its going to be a fairly good value for money stay here, as long as you like to sleep in a very warm bedroom!  (Which I don't, being from the UK)"
Feb 2016,50,Outstanding,"Couldn't fault any aspect of this marvellous hotel. Huge bed, fluffy comfortable pillows, every thing just so! All staff smiling, helpful and paying attention to the guests. Particularly charming was the surprise birthday cake and wine a lovely personal touch, particularly as we didn't tell them it was my birthday. Obrigada."
Feb 2016,30,Unexpected side effects,"Later we heard that we had to pay 100 euros up front. When we were about to check out and receive our 100 euros they kept 6 euros because of some weird capital tax they didn't tell us about. This all was told afterward, not up front."
Feb 2016,50,Wonderful Stay! Already booked our return,"We stayed here for three nights in February to celebrate my husbands 30th birthday.We booked an Executive room on the 21st floor and were delighted with it. Room was spacious and had a nespresso machine as a nice touch. Could not fault the bed and we slept wonderfully. My only criticism of the room would be that I dislike a bath/shower combo and when we stay in 5* hotels at this room level, we usually have separate bath and shower but what we had was clean and lovely still. I would advise getting a room with access to the executive club lounge as it was a really nice rest stop during our visits and we had lovely evenings there with the views and a glass of wine.Service could not have been better and we have booked to return here in December for our wedding anniversary."
Feb 2016,50,Great hotel for a one night layover on the way from London to Accra,"Stayed just for one night as a 24 hour layover.  close to the airport, the hotel has first class facilities and very helpful and friendly staff.  The twin room was very comfortable and well-equipped.  Breakfast was superb."
Feb 2016,50,A Lisbon delight ,"Stayed here with a group of 7 friends for my brothers birthday. Hotel is beautiful, clean and decor stunning. Loved the lounge area and the outside seating area. Staff attentive and friendly - always responded to our sometimes demanding requests. Room was large and fresh and clean. An ideal base to see the beautiful city of Lisbon. Only negative was you needed to buy a swim cap to use the pool - surely complimentary for guests. This was the only negative. Will definitely return to this hotel if I'm lucky to visit Lisbon again. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
Feb 2016,40,Good Hotel next to an excellent Zoo,"This hotel is what you'll expect with a typical 4 star accommodation. The service is good, amenities are if a decent standard, and staff are polite and very helpful. Although it's on the outskirts of the centre of Lisbon, it makes up for this by its proximity to the Metro and Train station. The Zoo which is located a short walking distance away is definitely perfect for families with children. One key tip: book the executive floor as the views and extras are worth the additional cost."
Feb 2016,50,Treated like a VIP!,The Corinthia Hotel is fantastic. The upgrade we took was more than worth it. We only stayed for 3 days because we didn't have more time but we will return and will make reservations at the Corinthia again because everything was excellent and the staff members were great. We enjoyed the food and the great from the 24th floor when we had breakfast. Thanks alot for making our stay this pleasant.
Feb 2016,50,Ian Garrity,"First class service Staff so friendly and helpful. Ideal location near to Airport 15min , and a tram or taxi ride away from Centre'. Booking to go back.. If you want a 5Star hotel you could do no better than the Corinthia Hotel."
Feb 2016,30,Could have been better.,"Just spent 5 nights in (5*) corinthia hotel in a beautiful city. Good location, good food and good overall service. Had a family holiday 2 adults and 3 children. We booked via expedia 2 rooms and we thought we already paid for breakfast (the most expensive hotel with expedia) but had to pay extra for breakfast 315 Euros,including discount 2 euro per head ! another offer to upgrade to executive room and pay 650 Euros. It would have been good to offer a complimentary drink or small bowel of fruit for 2 young children on arrival !!Big disappointment that we used the swimming pool ( 3 times) and reported a blocked toilet in the Gent's and not repaired even in mid week !!! Charged for 2 head caps 10 euro for kids hair and yet there is a blocked toilet in swimming pool area, Very high risk on hygiene form the hotel, not from the hair of 2 young kids. I was asked at checkout if all was well on my stay and the shift manager told me. blocked toilet will sort out (after 5 days !!) and still has to pay for the 2 hats, Very Little money 10 euros for overall spend of £2000 on hotel cost but it would have been nice to say we apologize and waive the charges for the hats 10 euros!. To me, even little things can make a difference. May not go back again to same hotel.. AlfDr AH and Dr LA"
Feb 2016,40,Rating Mr Kranker,All over the hotel more than lived up to our high expectations - a wonderful stay. Especially the breakfast buffet was remarkable. Furthermore the service at the front desk concerning tourist information was excellent.
Feb 2016,50,Smashing hotel,"Good location, very close to metro which was exceptionally easy to use - just a few stops and you were in the centre of Lisbon.  Quiet spacious room, very clean. Staff helpful and friendly. Excellent buffet breakfast."
Feb 2016,50,Multiple times,"This was my second stay at this hotel, and will be a few more I guess. The staff was extremely friendly, and helpful. I've left my laptop charger at home, they have not had one, but gave me perfect guidance and could buy one easily. The room and its decor is very nice and relaxing. The breakfast is fabolous, you can have anything that you could think about. Wifi works smoothly, had no issue with it at all. Only thing I would mention that the SPA facility is under renovation right now, according to the receptionist till 1st of April, 2016. So I could not use these facilities, which I usually do. I am sure after the renovation will be better than ever before. I highly recommend to stay at this hotel, since it is reasonably close to the airport, and also to the Sporting Lisbon stadium, if you are football fan. Enjoy!"
Feb 2016,50,Corinthia Hotel,Excellent and friendly hotel with good connections right into the cityRoom was very good but more Tv channels were needed Sky lounge excellent the view over the city is amazing We had a great holiday
Feb 2016,40,Excellent hotel & location,"I booked this hotel as a surprise for our anniversary and booked a junior exec room. Upon getting to our room we ended up with a view over buildings. The bell boy was still in the room so I asked for a view over the bridge and river. This was not too much trouble and after a 2 minute call he took us to a new room. The views were amazing.The new room were allocated had a lounge area (settee, desk, TV) large bedroom (queen and TV) and bathroom. The room had everything in it plus more. We were on the exec floor so had access to the exec lounge. Breakfast served up there was fantastic. We were informed there was food all day although we didnt go. However at night, there was still nibbles served til 10pm and a choice of soft drinks, wine, lager and green wine (sparkling wine).A taxi from the airport was 8.50 and its a similar price from the hotel to the city centre. There is a tube station 2 min walk away and you can buy a day ticket for 6 euro which allows you travel on the tube, trams and city lifts. I went to watch Benfica v Zenit one night (30 euro and bought ticket on day at stadium - take ID) and the wife went to the Colombo shopping centre which is right next to the stadium so were we both happy. Its only 2 stops away on the tube.Only slight downside - when I went for a swim I didn't have any shampoo, gown or slippers in my locker. When I asked the desk, I was made to feel a little stupid when asked by 2 ladies am I sure they aren't in there. Im sure I would see them in a little locker. If you go for a swim you have to wear a swimming cap. So take your own or you can buy one there.Overall view, I spent loads of time deliberating on which hotel to book in Lisbon. I am very happy I chose this hotel. Great location, rooms and very friendly staff."
Feb 2016,50,Excellent base for family stay,Booked the Corinthia as wanted a hotel with pool for kids over half term break.In short it ticked all the boxes - inter-connecting rooms worked very well with really comfy beds and good sized bathrooms. Service really good throughout - all the staff had time for a smile or a word and despite the fact that it is a very big place (and would not be my normal type of hotel) we felt very welcome. They even spotted birthday cards in the room and delivered a cake and bottle of fizz entirely gratis!Kids loved the pool and breakfast was really impressive - huge choice and very pleasant dining room.It is slightly out of the old town but the metro is very efficient and we were able to get into town very rapidly. Would definitely use again if we return.
Feb 2016,50,Top Class,"This stay was the second one in this group of hotels, we had previously stayed in Budapest. We were up graded without asking to a Junior Suite whIch was excellent. The hotel offers everything one would wish for. The staff are very professional and extremely helpful. We would recommend this hotel without hesitation and hope to stay in one of the others in the group soon."
Feb 2016,40,Valentine's Day Weekend,"This was our first visit to this brand and we booked an Executive Room for more comfort and space and lounge access.On arrival there was no Executive Room check in facilities although there was a desk which was generally not staffed during our four day stay. The desk allocated us 2215 which was surprisingly small for an Executive Room. We tend to always book these rooms but had never experienced a room this small on our travels.In the Executive Lounge the staff were very friendly and helpful but drink choice was limited to red and white wine and sparkling wine - not even a glass of port was available. Supplies of the two main hot courses were fairly limited but there was plenty of snack food available. Breakfasts were particularly good with a wide range of items to choose from. The heaters weren't that effective as the scrambled eggs were only lukewarm, but very tasty.In Room 2215 the bathroom door wouldn't close without being locked and bizarrely, to pictures on the wall were obstructed by the TV and lampshade. The TV only had news channels available and did not include BBC.I don't believe 2215 was an Executive Room and part of the reason for our booking is that the website offers room upgrades but we didn't get one.The location is good with a Metro and Railway Station just across the road with the Zoo just beyond.On the Sunday night it appeared the coffee shop restaurant was closed, forcing guests to use their more expensive restaurant.Many thanks to the staff in the Executive Lounge for making our stay so enjoyable."
Feb 2016,40,Good,Good hotel close to so amenities. There are two metros close to the hotel plus a railway station. The swimming is ok. The zoo is round the corner. We got a high rise room facing the famous bridge which was a bonus
Feb 2016,50,Fabulous hotel,"My wife and I have just returned from a four night break at the Corinthia. We chose this hotel because of our very positive experience at Corinthia Budapest a while back - and we were not disappointed. We stayed in an executive suite, so had access to the lounge on the top floor with its panoramic views over the city. This was very comfortable and there was always a selection of drinks and snacks during the day. Soup at lunchtime and canapés in the evening were very welcome.The hotel is in the business district but the city centre is easily accessible - a brisk walk if you fancy that, but there is a metro station some 50 metres or so away as well as the overground railway where you can catch a direct train to Sintra (recommended). Public transport in Lisbon is punctual, efficient and cheap. So - back to the hotel. The staff were very friendly and really went out of their way to make us feel very welcome. The bed in our suite was enormous and the most comfortable in which we have ever slept. We asked for a late check out and we were obliged with a 4pm departure which helped enormously with our flight timings. I understand that if you book direct through the hotel website (as we did) then this is one of the benefits.We chose to have breakfast in the main restaurant  and this was excellent - as good as any we have had - lots of choice with the bonus of a dedicated omelette chef (always a winner!)My only (usual) gripe is with the TV. We had two large widescreen tv's in our suite - which was great - but it seemed that the only English speaking channels were free view type rolling news. I accept that we did not intend to spend our trip telly watching, but over this particular weekend the weather was dismal and we spent more time inside than we had hoped. It would have been useful to have more light entertainment channels available.We will return to Lisbon and will certainly stay at the Corinthia without hesitation. The hotel is modern,impressive and well deserving of its 5 star rating."
Feb 2016,50,Beautiful hotel,"Everything we expected of a 5* hotel. We stayed on the 7th floor, and had beautiful views over the city. The room was spotlessly clean, and the bed was incredible - huge and amazingly comfy!The bathroom was fantastic, with in-built radio, good-sized bath with shower, and de-fogging mirror. We made use of the spa during our stay, and were very impressed with its cleanliness, and the helpfulness of the staff. Complementary drinks whilst in the spa were great, and although there were a fair number of people in there, it felt very relaxing. I would absolutely recommend visiting.The only downsides (and I'm being mega picky here) is that the location is a bit 'industrial'. But, it's also about 1 minute from the metro which is great!(It's worth knowing that they require a debit/credit card with at least 200 Euros credit to leave at the desk to cover any minibar expenses...)"
Feb 2016,30,"A modern, clean hotel with all the expected amenities","We booked a prepaid for a superior (ordinary) twin room with an accessible bathroom several months in advance of out stay and this was confirmed.  Upon arrival, the receptionist asked what we meant by ""accessible"", apparently not knowing what the term meant.  She then upgraded us to a junior suite which had a king sized bed and an ordinary bathroom (I love my son but not that much) .  We were told there was no such thing as an accessible bathroom in the hotel and settled for an ordinary twin room. Upon checking out, we were told by another receptionist that the reason we could not have the room with the accessible bathroom was that that room was already occupied.  Poor training of receptionists?  Poor management of prepaid reservations?  I would not recommend this hotel if you have any special needs."
Feb 2016,50,Beautiful hotel,"Great facilities , good food , friendly staff and excellent location makes this hotel a must for the seasoned  traveller. In addition the restaurant which has a wide choice of menu is reasonably priced . The hotel is located a stone throw away from main railway station and the coach station is within walking distance. Well worth a visit."
Feb 2016,50,Amazing Stay! ,"It's safe to say Corinthia never disappoints but this hotel was truly something else, everywhere was immaculate and the rooms were large and everything you'd expect from a 5* hotel. It is out of the centre of Lisbon but this didn't impact is greatly, the metro station is close, cheap and it's easy to find your way around the city. We had breakfast in the hotel which was delicious and I would definitely recommend it so you don't have to travel into Lisbon and then find somewhere to eat. We also ended up eating in the main hotel restaurant most of times during our stay and the meal (A la Carte menu) and service was some of the best we've ever received. Following this, we had drinks outside listening to the resident piano player which was a great end to every evening. I'd thoroughly recommend this hotel and cannot wait to return when we come back to Lisbon!"
Feb 2016,30,Failed to impress again,"This is my second time at the Corinthia Lisbon and I'm afraid to say once again it has failed to impress us. Queues for omelettes has distracted the one chef from being able to deliver anything else. No beans, no sausages, no waffles. All run out for over 20mins. I expect more from 5* hotel."
Feb 2016,50,Total Satisfaction,"My wife and I have been guests at the Corinthia on six separate occasions since January 2015, totalling some 42 nights, and have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as the place to stay in Lisbon either for business or leisure.The service offered is exceptional throughout all departments, and the welcome offered is faultless including the General Manager Reuben Mifsud, Guest Services and Executive Club Manager Sandra Abrantes together with Doormen Domingos and Roque, Guest Services staff Marta, Lillia, Margarida, Ruth, Ines, Rute and Joanna plus Executive Club staff Daniel, Constantine, Andre and Valter. I cannot exclude the superb housekeepers for their attention to detail in servicing the rooms.The Corinthia hotel is well located with readily available taxis, a metro/rail station across the road together with an airport/tourist bus stop which give good access to all areas of the city and surrounding tourist locations, Estoril and Sintra for example.In conclusion I can fully recommend this hotel for any reason to visit this wonderful city, if Lisbon is your destination the Corinthia Hotel will not disappoint.This is a five star hotel with all the amenities one would expect at a very competitive price."
Feb 2016,50,Fantastic hotel,5 ladies had a weekend break to Lisbon and chose the corinthia hotel we was a 5 star plus experience from walking in the door to leaving the staff were fantastic the hotel was amazing the service was a total treat  the indoor pool was perfect and the rooms were all gorgeous  all in all we couldn't find anything negative to say about this hotel we would all recommend it to anyone  it was roughly a ten minute walk to the centre and around 6 euros for 5 for a taxi and it was only 11 euros to the airport   Perfect few days away
Feb 2016,40,Neat and nicely appointed,"This is a large ""business"" hotel on the edge of the city centre but is conveniently placed for public transport. It lacks a bit of carachter but the service was excellent and the rooms very nicely appointed so I would definitely consider it"
Feb 2016,50,Always a great stay.,"Stayed here last week again, such a fabulous hotel and it's the staff that make it so special for us. We have been here 5 times in the last 12 months!  Why? Because we love it here. Everything you need for a relaxing holiday or for business in one place. The Corinthia Hotel is situated slightly out of the main city centre, but metro is opposite and only 5 mins into town. They have a fully equipped spa and gym with a hot indoor pool and hydrotherapy area.  Each room is well prepared and housekeeping do an excellent job keeping up the 5* standards. We had an Executive Suite which comes with access to the Sky Lounge on the 24th floor.  Excellent views over Lisbon and service with a smile. The lounge offers a full breakfast until 11am and snacks and drinks all day. There is hot soup for lunch and a hot snack available early evening such a great variety. Beer and Wine are also included also offers soft drinks and tea and coffee. You will be spoilt for choice. The Sky Lounge is managed by the lovely Sandra who has a great team who pride themselves on customer service. Daniel is always ready with your tea each morning and nothing is too much trouble.  Valter (the chef) makes great omelettes at breakfast.  Thank you. The guest services team again, are so helpful and always have suggestions on where to go in Lisbon. Ruth, Marta, Ines, Margarida, Rute, Joanna and Lillia all go that extra mile. We find the staff here at this hotel are the friendliest and they always remember us and greet us each time asking about our day and where we have been etc. The front of house staff including the doormen and Concerige offer a great ""little extra"" touch to your experience!  Domingos and Roque are always there to help with local information and make you feel special. And to top off all the special touches are the housekeeping team!  They were great. Always added a special something to make us smile when we returned to our rooms each day and everything in its place. Oh!  And the turn down service with that little extra chocolate was a lovely treat each evening. All in all...a great 5* pampering experience. The beds are fantastic, slept great all week. We will be back guys. We miss you already.  Seriously, if you need to relax...try the Corinthia. Has the lot and FREE WIFI which is speedy too.  Cannot fault."
Feb 2016,40,Relaxing weekend stay in Lisbon,"My fiancee and me stayed at the Corinthia for the weekend. Everyone was very friendly and the room had an amazing view.Across the street you have the famous restaurant 7 Mares, which you should also check out.The Spa is very nice, although you will have to bring a bathing cap with you or purchase one at the spa reception, which for us was a bit unusual to have to use one (unless you have a shaved head) :)"
Jan 2016,40,"Elegant, top hotel","The Corinthia hotel is undoubtely deserving all its stars. Rooms are spacious, clean and elegant, equipped with anything you may need. The guests can enjoy the use of a pool and the gym and the guest services are top level. the only two things which were strange to us where the price of the breakfast (20€ per person, it could be included in the room price) and the price to use the sauna and the steam bath (20€ per two hours, in most hotels of this category, the use is free). If you look on lisbon's map it may seem that the hotel is a little bit far from the center, but honestly it is just 5 metro stops away, no need to change the line, and the metro stop is right across the street, so don't get discouraged if you think the location is not optimal!"
Jan 2016,50,Great Place for Business and Relax!!,"I've organised a conference at the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon in the beginning of this week.The location, the rooms, the facilities, the conference area, the food, the customer service, the prices... EVERYTHING PERFECT!!!I will definitely come back to this hotel on Holidays and/or for business.I highly recommend it!!!"
Jan 2016,50,Great hotel for a business meeting/convention,"Beautiful, comfortable hotel with excellent service.  The room was well appointed and very clean,  The bed was comfortable.  Room service was excellent and delivered promptly.  I attended a meeting there and the staff was very accommodating all the coffee breaks were very nice."
Jan 2016,40,Comfortable Stay,"Friendly staffs, comfortable room. I experienced baggage delay, the doorman is very kind by showing me direction to the nearby mall to get the necessity. Guest Service staff is also helpful to follow up for my baggage. Location of the hotel is convenient w public transport and there is also cab around. Like the safe int the room, I can change the code every time when I use it. Setback is waiting time for lift is long when there is a big crowd, however the hotel stuffs are very patient in helping the crowd to smooth up the waiting."
Jan 2016,50,Great  pleasure to stay!,"Charlotte and William,  our stay Januari  21 till  Januari 22 was really very pleasant. The  staff was extremely nice and helpful, we felt really welcome. The  hotel looks very nice and the atmosphere made us feeling very relaxed which was just what we needed after a long and tiring trip. We enjoyed the meals especially the diner  and next days' luch at Tipico. We decided that we will come back to visit Lisbon and than stay again at  the Corinthia."
Jan 2016,50,Best views of Lisbon,"Our room was on the 19th floor (south facing) giving us an amazing view of the city from our floor-to-ceiling windows.The staff were really helpful and friendly particularly the restaurant staff. Access to to the city was made easy as the metro is less than 5 mins walk away and the zoo is less than 10 mins away!Overall, great location, brilliant staff and excellent service. 10/10"
Jan 2016,30,Mediocre,I think it is the first time I receive an upgrade and i am still unhappy with the hotel. The moment we drove in the alley we were greeted by Domingos who had prepared for us some arrogant jokes. His whole attitude was of a smart guy and I did not like it. The lobby looks really nice and even the rooms are clean and well furnished. Still the Junior Suite had a strange architecture with a corner in between so it looked not bigger than the room. The chocolate upgrade we had ordered was basically 6 small pieces of candy which were far from appealing. Also the rooms are noisy from the above where someone was walking with heels in the room at 6 AM. The best thing about the hotel was the Executive Lounge breakfast. So I would not say that the experience is terrible but I would suggest something else if you are in Lisbon.
Jan 2016,40,Excellent service,"Clean and comfortable. Staff are excellent, polite and willing to assist.  Room was on the small side but with all amenities I needed. I couldn't figure out how to lock the room safe and the service person arrived promptly and assisted me immediately. If I travel to Lisbon again I would like to stay at the Corinthia."
Jan 2016,50,A pleasure ,"Nice rooms, nice staff, very nice breakfast buffet, nice spa. Everything was nice. Located approximately 4 km from the city centre, but ok walking distance. If you'd rather take a taxi, they're right outside the door. Well known by the taxi drivers, so you will always find your way back if you tell them the hotel name. I do recommend this hotel!"
Jan 2016,40,Very Nice Hotel. Ideal for exploring Lisbon,"The Corinthia is just about a 3 minute walk from the Zoologica Metro Station and about 6 metro stops from the city centre (travel time around 15 minutes).Lobby is big and welcoming and reception staff (Debra) very friendly. Check-in was very quick.Small problem on arrival was that I had requested an executive suite quiet room and found my room had a connecting door with a loud crying baby in the next room. This was quickly resolved and I was given a junior suite on 20th floor which was very nice. This was a ""smoking"" room and smelt of stale cigarette smoke but this was not a problem for me as after the window was opened the smell disappeared.Hotel bar is cosy and staff (Rodrigo) were very friendly and went out of their way to get to know customers.Room service menu is excellent and reasonably priced.Room is cleaned daily and turn-down service comes around about 6pm to prepare room.Breakfast buffet is also very good with a selection of hot and cold dishes. The chef will also prepare hot food while you wait.This is an excellent hotel with great staff.One criticism though. I stayed for 5 nights and was charged 29 Euros per day for internet access - this I think is appalling considering I only checked e-mails in iPad for about 20 minutes per day."
Jan 2016,40,Ideal venue,"Global conference - full agenda, lots of people, meetings, activities, presentations etc. Great facilities, food and service. I can definitely recommend this venue to anyone looking for a business or private visit to Lisbon."
Jan 2016,50,Excellent,"Everything is perfect. The room is large, clean and comfortable. Free wifi gives superfast connection. Services are remarkable. The music facilities in the bathroom relax people after tight travel schedule."
Jan 2016,50,Lovely hotel,"It was lovely staying here for 4 nights - staff were very helpful and courteous, the facilities are amazing and so was the food (their apple pie dessert was delicious). If you're in Lisbon, I'd definitely recommend a stay at the Corinthia!"
Jan 2016,50,"Wow, can't wait to go back","From the moment we stepped through the main entrance it was magic. We were taken to a private desk for the check in and given a glass of port. On entering the 18th floor room the wow factor did not stop. The room was super luxurious and the view through the floor to ceiling panoramic window over the city was fabulous. The on going service that was provided met and exceeded our expectations, including delicious breakfasts, snacks and evening dinner. We will be back."
Jan 2016,40,Great hotel,Great hotel. Decent breakfast. Comfortable rooms. Well located. Choose a higher floor if that's possible. A bit far from downtown Lisbon but taxis are inexpensive and metro station is only a couple hundred meters from the hotel for a line that will take you right to downtown.
Jan 2016,50,Very enjoyable stay - fantastic staff,"Very nice and enjoyable stay, where everything went perfect. The room was very comfortable, clean and spacious. The Staff was very helpfull and welcoming and I didn't experience any problems. Used the conference rooms a lot which was very useful and fulfilled the needs we had to 100%"
Jan 2016,40,"Top Hotel, great staff",Very good stay. Especially via welcoming and helpful staff.  No need to write much more than that! gkdghks;ghds;khgsd;khgdkhggdks;lhgd;skhgd;klhgdkhgdkhd;sklhgdkshg;dkshg;ksdhgksdhkghdskghsdkghsd;khgsd;khgd;kshgsd;khg
Jan 2016,50,Excellent Hotel,"I recommend this hotel for Business and leisure. excellent food, services the price of Rum is very expensive. excellent breakfast ( French or English) you have choice. possibility to do sport, and good experince"
Jan 2016,40,Nice five-star hotel,"I stayed one night here in May.Room was very nice, but a little bit too big for me (if it can be problem). Visited also late evening at restaurant, got some gintonic and service was very good.Breakfast was the best thing in this hotel. Very good buffet and staff make omelettes and waffles on request!After all, very good five-star hotel. Everything works, clean, big room but still a little bit unfeeling."
Jan 2016,50,Faultless!!,"We had an amazing time.  From checking in to checking out - we cannot fault this hotel or staff.  Five star treatment all the way.  We were also given a bottle of bubbly and a birthday cake on arrival - both which were lovely.  Staff were friendly, food amazing, the Sky Lounge was an added bonus.  Cannot say anything negative about this hotel.  The location is perfect as the underground to so close by you can be anywhere in minutes.  The tour bus also stops near to the hotel so this can also be used as a way of getting around.  If we go back to Lisbon we will definitely stay at this hotel."
Jan 2016,30,Feed back,"Hello, I'm polish, however in order to give feed back I decided to write in English. I spent together with my wife 5 days. So:-hotel well located and overall good, including food-huuuuge in my view differences when speaking about service. So in my subjective scale 1-10 -restaurants 8-10 depending on people, great!!!-reception/concierge - 2-10, again depending on people, I was surprised how different approach they presented-room service :-) disaster.  1-2-We paid for breakfast services. So making the long story short - I spoke for a couple of Times about breakfast boxes. Many topics here. Anyhow at the end of the day in spite of former agreements I was informed that I should pay (in advance) for those boxes. Overall behavior was to me unacceptable.-room cleaning - 3-5 here you need to ask , otherwise do not expect to get the service :-(I have visited ""millions"" of hotel and I've never seen before such huge discrepancies. Meaning good hotel , great restaurant service and the rest... strange to me"
Jan 2016,30,Good Hotel,Hotel is away from many restaurants and coffee shops.  Nothing is within walking distance.  Breakfast could use a little more variety.  Breakfast needs coffee/expresso machines so everyone can get coffee and hot beverages themselves instead of waiting for servers to come to attend to you.  Don't like waiting for coffee.
Jan 2016,30,A 5 Star Hotel with medium Service and Standards,"When I arrived I waited quite a long time for check in. As soon as a Person was free at the Reception I stepped forward. She was busy with other things. After quite a while she looked up and asked if I wanted to check out. After my reply that I would like to check in, she then put on a big smile and welcomed me. Well, that felt not right. The room was very small compared to other 5 Star Hotels I have been to. It was clean. The Spa was not included in the room price, which very much surprised me. They charge 20 Euro extra if you wish to use the Swimming Pool or Sauna. This is not acceptable I think. I had no meals in the Hotel because all in all I didn't feel comfortable. The Hotel is close to a train station. It is not downtown. So if you stay for leisure this is not a good Hotel for Lisbon. Business only!"
Jan 2016,50,Worth every penny ,"This is an upmarket hotel, and it's work every penny. The hotel is located right next to the metro and you can be able to go out and see Lisbon without hustle. The staff are okay, although they could be more engaging and seem more interested in your comfort. I found the rooms roomy enough, with great views from the 7th floor where I was. Also the breakfast menu is vast enough. Lunch menus are very versatile  often with Portuguese dishes done to perfection."
Jan 2016,30,Corinthia Lisbon Experience,Good family hotel . Room was small. Room furniture needs remodel. TV reception needs to improve.Great staff. Good location. Metro and zoo are close to the hotel. Taxis are easy to get. Traffic is a problem on rainy days and rush hour.
Jan 2016,50,Wonderful hotel,"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights for his 65th birthday in january and although the weather wasn't good, the hotel and Lisbon were wonderful. The staff at this hotel are amazing and nothing is too much trouble. On my husband's birthday, wherever we went in the hotel, staff were wishing him happy birthday. He was presented with a birthday cake and a bottle of sparking wine, courtesy of the hotel and the attention to detail is amazing. Thank you to all  for contributed to a wonderful couple of days."
Jan 2016,30,Customer service training needed,Lovely staff at reception and dining room.Spa Experience - the rather rude lady receptionist tells made me go down to main reception in my swimming trunks as I did not have a card to get back to my room through the lift. She insists that I wear a bathing cap to avoid falling hair contaminating the pool(what about pubic and axillary hair?)!!We are asked to shift rooms as the first room has fault: The porter who brings the keys to the new room says: 'Can you not carry your bags to the next room yourself?'You decide for yourself..........
Jan 2016,50,Memorable stay,"the Hotel is great value for money. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The bar / lounge food and drinks menu is great value for money. Overall a very enjoyable stay and I will return again  soon. It is located beside the subway which is very convenient. The Breakfast choices  meet everyone's tastes. There is a piano bar and the piano player, Miguel Viera is sensational. You would go to this hotel just to hear him play"
Jan 2016,30,"Good, but.....","Although the staff were nice and attentive, I think for a five star hotel they do not go that extra mile to make one feel really comfortable. There was always an excuse, or explanation why something could not be done. There wasn't the can do attitude of the Corinthia in Budapest or Moscow.The service is a little impersonal too, when comparing these other two hotels. The executive lounge was good, but again not in the class of the two mentioned above. The doorman was always too busy to open the door of our cab, when we arrived back in the evening. He always seemed to be engaging someone in conversation and not really present doing his job. I always had rather along wait to speak to a customer representative too and felt the level of service which I'd come to expect from the Corinthia brand was slightly lacking. Not a bad stay, but not memorable either."
Jan 2016,50,Oasis in chaos,"As I was landing in Lisbon, I found that I had lost my wallet with all my Credit cards, and I.d.. I knew that it probably went missing in the security check-point in departures Heathrow. Being the last couple at the luggage carousel, and missing our bags in Lisbon, we had a sinking feeling. Arriving at the hotel, I explained our situation, and the desk manager reassured us and not only allowed us to use the desk phone freely, but upgraded us to a junior suite because of our stressful situation. Eventually our bags and an emergency card arrived for us,but the staff continued to show great concern .Great hotel, good location, wonderful staff, will return again."
Jan 2016,40,very good,good hotel and services. A good breakfast . The room was clean and big with clean bath. The taxi are good kind to go around .Bella esperienza e ottimo servizio. accurato e gentile da ritornarci sicuramente
Jan 2016,50,Anniversary celebration,"Hotel located 3 minutes from Metro station, no problem to get to citycenter.Will stay at Corinthia Hotel Lisbon any time.Perfect rooms and service.The bar in the garden is absolutely worth a visit in the summer!"
Jan 2016,50,Excellent hotel,"Good value for money hotel, however charges for food and drink is not cheap, the location of the hotel is out in a financial district, but their is a metro station opposite which makes access to city o"
Jan 2016,50,Excellent New Year trip,"We were upgraded by this lovely hotel on arrival. We were placed in a junior suite which gave us access to the Executive Lounge with its free refreshments (including champagne !). The hotel staff were all friendly and extremely attentive. A room on the 23rd floor offered us view of the bridge and aqua duct which, on New Years Eve was a wonderful sight. I could not recommend the hotel enough based on our experience."
Jan 2016,40,Good hotel,"It is a well decorated hotel, very good service. Very modern and contemporary, the food and specially breakfast is really good. The only downside is the location, kind of far from downtown but close to subway stations and the airport. Taxi ride from the hotel to downtown is not expensive 5 to 8 euros. If location is not important, this is a good hotel to stay."
Jan 2016,50,Thank you for the unforgettable experience!,"I wish I could give them 6 starts, because they really deserve it! I spent 5 nights in this hotel. I have been in several 5 stars hotel, thus I am not easy to impress with design, furniture and facilities. In this case I have been very impressed by the staff! They have been all fantastic! From the guy at the entrance, to all the staff at the reception, guest services, cleaning etc! they all went for the extra mile, making my experience amazing! Thank you a lot for taking care of me! I will see you soon!"
Jan 2016,50,Five Star Plus,"Anybody who finds fault with this hotel is very hard to please. We arrived on a rainy afternoon and straight away was protected by the doorman with an umbrella. Checking in was a breeze and we were upgraded from an executive double to a junior executive suite. On the 23rd floor we had great views of the city including the aquaduct and the famous bridge. The suite was well appointed with a good sized bathroom including bath and shower. The bed was a super king and very comfortable. One minus was the air con which didnt seem able to cope and the room was often a bit warm. The best thing with an executive room is the executive lounge on the 24th floor. Open all day until 10 pm it is used for breakfast where a variety of hot and cold dishes are available, juices and good coffee. There is also an omelette station for eggs to order. The lounge is then used for the rest of the day for guests to relax in with free drinks incl wine and snacks. It is so chilled and laid back. The staff couldnt be faulted and couldnt do enough for you. We had the New Years Eve buffet included and also a bottle of bubbly appeared in our suite in time for midnight. All of the hotels staff were of the highest standard and couldnt be faulted. The hotel is very top class and i cannot recommend this highly enough.Visit here!"
Jan 2016,40,"Well situated, very friendly and helpful staff.","We stayed for almost a week over the New Year.The hotel is in a good location (lots of other hotels nearby too) right by the Zoo, and is slightly under 20 mins from the centre by metro.Facilities are very good, the staff are very friendly and helpful.We passed on the €18 a head breakfast (adult) as you can eat perfectly well in a host of nearby cafes, the one nearest the Sete Rios station being about the best, despite the rather surly proprietor.For food, look out for the Sushi & Grill restaurant just round the corner. Really excellent value at €17.99 a head all you can eat dinner, be careful not to over order.Sete Rios station features the overground train as well as the Metro, do take that to the Oriente station for the superb Aquarium and excellent science museum, about 15 mins away.The Corinthia has a nice gym and pool and spa, the rooms a plush enough without being over the top.Personal bug bear was the easy listening radio in built in the bathroom, some really schmalzy tunes which seemed immune to most attempts to extinguish them. Clearly the room service were under instructions to keep it going as despite me turning it down every evening, it was cranked up on our return.However it would be churlish to let this small detail affect an overall good impression.Two tips, do go to the market at Cais de Sodre (two Michelin starred chefs amongst others) for cooking out of this world at old school prices. Make an effort to hunt down the Macaroons there (especially the Port ones).Also, do go to the BA Winebar in Barrio Alto, but book first, capacity for 16 makes it a very intimate celebration of Portuguese tapas and wine, not to be missed.Should you be feeling flush try taking your other half to look at the fine ceramics of the Vista Alegre shop at Chiado Largo"
Jan 2016,50,So convenient for getting everywhere,"I booked directly through the hotel website and got a great price so decided to upgrade to an Executive Room which gives access to Executive Lounge to which non executive guests are politely turned back to the lift. This gave us breakfast(lovely) all day access to the lounge, business centre and fantastic views. Canapés, fruit, cakes, nuts, soup, bread, cheeses, and drinks inc beer and wine available all day till 22.00. Very attentive staff. Modern leisure club with treatments on 2nd floor but no showers so you go in your robe and slippers. Lighting around the pool was dim so although there are loungers, I couldn't read easily and the air temperature was a bit disappointing. Noticed more loungers outside pool area too, also there is a garden area with tables and chairs and water features at the back of the hotel facing the Mercure. We didn't eat dinner at the hotel as a lot of the food on the buffet was familiar from the Executive Lounge. However there are a few places to eat very close. We had a pizza at Casa Mia to the right through the front door and a nice steak/octopus at Lekker through the garden, cross the road, bear right then turn left and follow road for about 150m. The location has been subject to negative reviews but we thought it was ideal for us. We got the red Metro from the airport then changed to the blue N for 2 stops which is for the zoo. 2 floors above is Sete Rios mainline station which enabled us to go easily to Sintra for the day, recommended, and also to Caiscais though this involved walking from one station to another to connect lines. It was fantastic to be able to walk for miles on a lovely walkway along the coast to Estoril. We bought a 50 cents travel card at a machine in the airport metro stationthen topped it up for 6 euros for 24 hour travel each day. The alternative is the Lisbon Card 18 euros which also gives unlimited travel and also some entrance fee discounts. We spent one day in downtown Lisbon, about 20 minutes on Metro, but with the guide book saw what was open between Christmas and New Year and did a bit of shoe shopping. The area around the Castle isn't easy to get too unless you like a walk but is worth exploring. We did look at the main hotel area near the statue of the Marques de Pombal but preferred our area. It felt safe and the road the hotel is on is a mix of uses but dominated by banks and medical/dental services. We really enjoyed our 4 nights in this lovely hotel. However, it would be nice to have an alternative to all the TV news programmes. BBC Entertainment didn't seem to work so we had to resort to Rai1 and 3 as the Italian speakers did have a little more variety."
Jan 2016,30,Ok but not perfect,"We had mixed feelings about this hotel. Overall it is a nice property. Rooms were spacious for European hotel and were clean. Housekeeping was very good and responsive. Guest services and the restaurant service were not as consistent. One woman in guest services was very unhelpful as we tried to get information about airport transportation, telling us that a taxi would probably be there. When we inquired about a taxi that would hold all of our luggage, she said it may or may not and said she could not make any arrangements to arrange a cab that would definitely hold our luggage. She made no attempt to assist in arranging for transportation. Other people in guest services were more helpful when we inquired about other questions. The breakfast buffet  is very good but the service unfortunately was not. When they are busy it is nearly impossible to get a cup of coffee and we were pretty much ignored and had to seek out someone to get our coffee. The lines are very long and slow moving in the buffet as well--poor design with having to stand in the line for making custom omelets just to get to the prepared hot food options. The rooms get very hot at night and we were told there is no way to cool them off except to turn off the fan. You cannot actually control the temperature in the rooms. There is quite a bit of noise from the street even on the higher floors so opening the windows to cool off isn't a great option. Computers in business center are awful and froze up on us twice (we tried two separate ones) so don't rely on them for doing any business.One other negative is that you can't use their pool without a swim cap (for everyone). Not exactly the kind of item one packs when going on a city vacation. They will of course be happy to sell them to you. Be aware that this hotel is far from the center of Lisbon. You have to use public transport or take a cab to get there. Not an area to walk around at night as not much around except few limited restaurant options."
Jan 2016,40,Very good hotel - would stay here again,"This is a very good hotel in Lisbon, not absolutely central but very close to transportation and taxis are easy to get.The rooms were very spacious (we booked an Executive suite) and service was very friendly.There is a nice gym and quite a large pool available at the Spa area. Free WIFI is included.The staff is very friendly but sometimes seem a bit anxious to do something out of the ordinary. (my partner signed for a couple of drinks and they seemed to be afraid that they wouldn't get the money as the room was under my name).Altogether a very pleasant experience."
Jan 2016,50,Amazing place!!!!,I want to give more than 5 stars like 5 plus thanks for the marvellous place and l recommend for all my friends and family to be there the place and facilities is 5 stars and the access to central Lisbon its simple to go
Jan 2016,40,Great hotel but probably would not go back again,"I have stayed at this hotel three times (between 12'-14'), Clean, pleasant, friendly staff, great indoor pool and Gym, rich and very good breakfast.Our room had broken sockets,The maintenance man told us dont touch it but did not correct the fault.The view of road in front of the the hotel sometime make us feeling depressed (The previous times, got rooms with views of the bridge side) Music switch in the bathroom doesn't work. Despite a mishap with the room - We had to stay in the room. Spa: One Terrible Receptionist (I hope she is not there because the other girls were marvelous). Not so central (10-15 minute Metro ride to downtown), relatively close to the airport."
Jan 2016,50,Wonderful stay at Corinthia Hotel,"A beautiful hotel with excellent service, good facilities and very friendly and helpful staff. Located just outside the city centre, well connected by public transportation. I very much enjoyed my stay at the Corinthia hotel and would definitely recommend it when visiting Lisbon."
Jan 2016,40,Modern and convenience,"Nice and quiet area but close to metro station, even take a taxi to old town is just 6 or 7 euros, hotel buffet breakfast is excellent, gym and swimming pool is good, the two ladies in concierge will be good if with a bit smile."
Dec 2015,50,Excellent stay,"We had the pleasure of spending 5 nights in 2 Executive rooms (junior suite and connecting double) and without a doubt, this hotel holds its own with some of the most luxurious hotels I've visited around the world. Check in was efficient and friendly and you were greeted with a glass of port.  The staff all made it their business to offer a warm welcome to their beautiful, historic city. You are walking distance to the zoo and a short cab ride everywhere else. The double decker tour bus stop is just in the back down half a block. The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. The bath amenities were first class. Everyone had a bath robe and slippers. The beds were very comfortable.  Great free wifi anywhere in the hotel. The bar is a quiet oasis for drinks or light meals, and you can go outside where you will find a peaceful waterfall. The executive floor was extra but I would recommend it if you can. Great place for breakfast, dinner and snacks thru the day. Daniel was exceptional in his service and demeanor. He made you feel at home and ensured you received your coffee or tea just as you like or your drink in the evening. He is a great asset to the hotel. The indoor pool is nice and the spa provided great treatments.  Good sized gym. They provided towels you could take back to your room. My one criticism is the room service food which was insipid most of the time. The vegetable and chicken and rice soups were bland. The spaghetti and chicken nuggets were tasteless."
Dec 2015,30,"Good, but when something happened","The service in the hotel is very good. But we had some problem on rental car, they just said we have no responsibility. It destroyed our whole impression. The guest service on phone was rude and not paitient to  listen to my claim."
Dec 2015,40,"Ok stay , food not good at all","The Junior suite was nice  but very hot during my stay in December , the Ac was turn off from the hotel . The  Food was limited,  poor quality and over priced buffet, beside that the hotel was very nice, and very polite staff."
Dec 2015,40,Great stay,"Really enjoyed and recommend , it's quite central and comfortable. It's near to the metro and bus services. You can easily reach downtown. People are quite helpful and they even lend me a charger when mine broke down."
Dec 2015,50,Wonderful Hotel,Excellent hotel in every respect. Paid a bit extra for Executive room and it was well worth it. The attention we received from the waiter Daniel was second to none - not discounting the fact that the other staff were also great. The chef did the best omelette I've ever eaten. This was our first trip to Lisbon and we'll definitely be back and will stay at the same hotel.
Dec 2015,40,Xmas break,"Lovely hotel, great service, and food in the lounge bar was really nice for a light meal or drink. Spa was excellent. Had a great stay thank you!Breakfast was a bit of a disappointment though. Was very chaotic - it felt a bit like being in a railway station! Seemed like the set up of breakfast wasn't prepared for the number of the the hotel guests."
Dec 2015,50,Excellent Customer Service ,"We initially planned to stay here for 3 nights. However we ended up extending to 5 nights. Definitely the best 5 star service I have experienced in Europe. Staff very helpful and friendly.Rooms were spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable. We were given a large cot for the baby too.They also have an excellent bar/restaurant and wide selection for breakfast buffet.There was also a really talented pianist playing during dinner time over the weekend.Great service team Corinthia. Keep it up!"
Dec 2015,50,Best hotel experience ever,"Compared to other 5 star (and thereabouts) places I have stayed at, it was the very personal service that amazed me. Daniel in the executive lounge was the embodiment of the philosophy I saw reflected throughout the hotel."
Dec 2015,50,PERFECT JOURNEY IN CORINTHIA HOTEL LISBON,We had the fortune to have an upgrade to executive business level and our journey was excellent.Our suite was magnificent and the sky executive lounge at the 24th floor was incredible.Also the courtesy of the people made our trip perfect.
Dec 2015,40,Visiting a relative living nearby,"We stayed 8 nights in December 2015. Overall quality was good but not what we expected of a 5 start hotel: (1) breakfast menu was sufficient for us but reminded more a 4 star hotel, (2) we often had to ask the staff to provide the daily bottle of water, (3) we often had to ask for coffee at breakfast, (4) at breakfast our plates and cetlery were often taken away while we were still using them, (5) in the spa no soap was available and the showers were out of operation; only cold flush was available, (6) we had to book a room to our relative via a broker because the price offered by the hotel reception and web site was much higher. Positive: great view, friendly staff, close to metro station and some good restaurants."
Dec 2015,50,Luxury accommodation & faciities,"We had a wonderful three night stay here. Probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in with great views.  Excellent accommodation, staff and facilities.  Easy access to/from the airport & into the city."
Dec 2015,50,Excellent views and super comfortable beds!,"This is one of my favorite hotels ever! Clean,  bed supremely comfortable,  staff so friendly and helpful. The 24th floor executive lounge is fantastic. Can't say enough good things about this hotel. It's farther from city center,  but the view is worth it. Subway,  train and bus stops right across street,  so easy to get around.  Excellent!!"
Dec 2015,50,Everyone is wonderful,"From arriving by taxi to check in, room, check out.  Everyone is very very helpful.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is spending time in Lisbon.  It may be out of the center of town but that is a short Metro ride from the nearby Zoo station.  Also go across the road for fish....best restaurant in Lisbon."
Dec 2015,50,Perfect from start to finish,"We arrived at09h30 expecting to leave our bags and check-in later, but were told that a room was already available. In addition, art no extra cost, we had been up-graded to Executive Floor. The room was airy, fully equipped, and on the 23rd floor gave us a fantastic view over the city, and the ancient aqueduct. The fact that airplanes fly virtually over the hotel on landing was not an issue.... the soundproofing is 100%... no disturbance whatsoever.All the staff, and particular those in the Executive Lounge, were impeccable, and helped us make reservations when requested. Availability of Yellow Bus open-topped sightseeing tour just 2 minutes walk from the hotel was another plus.Would highly recommend."
Dec 2015,10,No Air conditioning.... even in executive suite !!!!,The temperature controller in the rooms are just for Show. They dont work. You should buy and bring a table fan with you if you wish to stay in this hotel. It is a good hotel otherwise. Nice executive lounge...
Dec 2015,40,Beautiful Hotel,Nice Hotel - Good Staff - Nice RoomsWe had a large business conference here and Lisbon is a wonderful and unique place - the beaches are unbelievable! Check out the zip line activities (outside the hotel) - you can zip between two castles and it is the highest zip line I have ever seen.  Great excitement.
Dec 2015,50,Excellent hotel!!!,"Excellent! very warm and welcoming stuff, great location and views! Great choise for leasure. Luxourious spa, rooms with fabulous view and access to the private lounge where free appetisers and drinks are offered all day long, plus a very nice lounge bar with light meals."
Dec 2015,50,luxury hotel and luxury treatment,"Booked a junior suite in this hotel but when we checked in, we were their quest for the day, which meant we got an upgrade to a junior executive suite. This was huge.  With extremely large luxury bed.  The best bed i have had in a hotel. This was ours for our 3 night stay.  As well as the executive room, we got access to the executive sky lounge on the 24th floor which had panoramic views.  This served snack food all day, cheese board and small cakes, plus coffee, win beers etc (no limit to what you could eat or drink).  We also got a turn down service each night and chocolates put on our pillow.  Great selection for breakfast and we had a buffet meal one night, which again was very good. Hotel was outside the city centre, but metro station right across the road, which was cheap. The staff are extremely helpful with very good English.  In the town of Lisbon, people were quick to offer their help if you looked lost."
Dec 2015,40,Convenient,"It may not be in the hub of Lisbon, but it's so close to the metro it doesn't take long to get into town.  There is a slight corporate feel to the hotel but it's convenient.Staff were helpful but I wouldn't say they went out of their way to make one feel at home, but the concierge was excellent; suggested and booked some great restaurants."
Dec 2015,50,Very nice - good and smart choice,I was with business trip and i was totally satisfied.Good place - location in respect to work and downtown and airport.Price - doesn't matter but it was Ok.Food - very good! Even better than Marriott!!!Rooms - clean and comfortable.Lobby - very nice. Stone on floors adds luxury image!Totally recommend.
Dec 2015,50,An Exellent Choice in Central Lisbon,"We stayed in this hotel while getting over jetlag before going on a cruise. Nice quiet location , a comfotable room, excellent facilities, and a remarkably friendly staff. The dning room offers both menu service and a full buffet. Close to the subway, and a safe neighborhood to walk in. We had a ver positive experience."
Dec 2015,50,Enjoyable and friendly hotel,Enjoyable and friendly hotel with excellent facilities and close to transport links into the centre of Lisbon any queries were resolved quickly and efficiently. Would recommend the hotel for a visit to Lisbon
Dec 2015,50,great with couple of.issues,should have had free room upgrade was never offeredthe room was great with nice viewsexecutive club well worth the extra moneyall staff friendlyvery extensive choice at breakfasteasy to get to 2 minutes from metro
Dec 2015,50,Excellnt service,"I highly recommend anyone who is after value for money. I stayed together with friends from Turkey and we enjoyed every bits of it. However, we haven't had plenty of time to spend in the hotel to benefit from all the facilities though I will think of coming back again."
Dec 2015,40,A great short break,"We enjoyed a few days city break here at the end of November. The room was good.The staff were friendly and helpful. The downsides were: The pillows were different sizes, there was no undersheet on the bed. The television stand was broken. The swimming pool was too cool to really enjoy your daily swim. This is one of my main pleasures when staying in a hotel, so this was disappointing.The food was great though, particularly the scrambled egg."
Dec 2015,50,Business stay,"Now this would be the third stay in this hotel this year. I have yet to find a hotel that offers such quality of stay, professionalism and friendliness. This is without counting the excellent rates that the hotel offers. Now for business this hotel is ideal for my requirements in organising events / training and conferences. First it is within 15 mins from the airport (slight traffic). Second the conference rooms are easily adaptable and the events managers and staff are really on the ball!Next is the quality of food and room service. They really make you feel at home and this was my impression everytime I cam back! The VIP buisness lounge + conference rooms on the top floor are a perk!They have recently included an indoor swimming pool and spa which is a real comfort! The only area which could leave room for improvement would be the furniture, in some areas (you really have to look though) it could do with a renewal. This said they have undergone key improvements with a good gym, spa and new reception area. Rome wasn't built in one day! :-)As for the surrounding area there are a few restaurants but you would really need to take a taxi to the centre of town to have the best to offer. Now the taxi would take about 5-10 mins and doesn't cost much - around 5 Euros.The Corithina is defnitely my hotel that I will return to especially with my family. Good shopping mall around 7 minutes drive from the hotel!"
Dec 2015,50,One of the best hotels,"friendly and professional  staff ,clean room, comfortable bed. excelente Spa faciliteis .fantastic veiws from the 24th floor club lounge .wonderful breakfast choice , staff always helpful whichmade the stay even better .Had a great weekend with friends .will definitely  be back ."
Dec 2015,50,Best Hotel and service,"When I walked in front desk informed us  that we were  ""guest of the day "",because of that  we were upgraded to a fantastic suite with executive floor access with great food and service, as well we were awarded with  a day in the SPA for two."
Dec 2015,40,Well cared-for,We had a truly enjoyable stay. Every one of the staff we met was friendly helpful and efficient. Our room was very comfortable - and breakfast was beautifully prepared.  Thank you all.  Convenient location suited our needs
Dec 2015,50,simply perfect,hard to point out what's great. it's all perfect. and i didn't even pay that much!really close to the airport. my uber cost only 6€.personnel speaks fluent english.really luxurious interior.great room with great beds. great shower and GREAT bathtub.24/7 gym (and what a great gym it is!) to which you have access with your key.but the spa… oh the spa! that's the icing to an already great cake! i had one of the best massages ever. and i can say i've been to a couple of spas.
Dec 2015,50,Great Hotel and Great Weekend,"We booked this hotel some months in advance and got a very good deal and had an upgrade to an executive room with access to all the executive facilities. We wanted to go away for a weekend to celebrate my wife’s birthday and we could not have had a better hotel. All the staff were very helpful, friendly and attentive. Staff who we singled out for a special mention were Daniel, Alexsander and Monika. (Hope I spelt and got them all right!)Have to pay particular thanks to Rute, whom nothing was too much trouble, her advice and knowledge of Lisbon was very helpful. Furthermore she made my wifes day on the Sunday (her birthday) by arranging (unbeknown to us both) a cake and sparkling wine in our room, after we returned from a day sightseeing! It was a wonderful gesture! Thank you.The facilities at this hotel are excellent and the executive lounge offers wonderful views from the 24th Floor. We were staying on the 20th floor and had great views overlooking the old aqueduct!For my wife’s birthday we ate in the hotel restaurant and the food was very good we both had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly.Hotel is a great base for exploring and is out of the main city centre but close to the metro station (on the blue line). So is easy to get around and explore. From the airport to the hotel is approximately 30-40 mins depending on the connections. Metro line from the airport is red and you go to the end and then take the blue line 2 stops towards the zoological centre (Lisbon’s zoo). The hotel is just around the corner from the metro station. Hotel grounds are nice with plenty of seating outside.Just have to say we were well looked after at this hotel and we would not hesitate to return. Thank you."
Dec 2015,50,You don't have to stay in downtown Lisbon!,"We stayed 4 nights in Corinthia Hotel and booked our room with executive lounge access.  although the hotel isn't situated in downtown Lisbon, it's not bad at all with taxi available all hours outside the property. We reached downtown quickly for 7-8euros, Belem for 8 euros and airport for around 10 euros.  We didn't even bother with public transportation.  Hotel staff is great and we had wonderful services from housekeeping to doorman.  Exec lounge is well worth it if you plan to stay here."
Dec 2015,50,Service with a smile,"Highly recommend this establishment, from your arrival t your departure, he staff make the dfference. The breakfast in the exciting lounge compares with any other establishment of the same rating.Concierge assisted with restaurant reservations and interaction regarding Lisbon evens helpful."
Dec 2015,50,Excellent,"Situated on the Metro route, Jardim Zoological station, close to the Zoo, the Lisbon bus experience and also good bus routes this is a great place to explore Lisbon. The higher the floor the more magical the view especially after dark.The Tempus bar has a pianist from Wednesday to Sunday, also a good food menu, well worth a shot.The rooms are well equipped with strong showers, excellent room service and large windows.there is a good Spa and a large indoor swimming pool.the gym is average.The breakfast is well worth the expense.As it is a business hotel the majority of English language channels are news orientated.A taxi to the airport should be about ten to twelve euros. A taxi downtown about the same, but u can buy a daily local transport ticket for five euros that cover metro, tram and bus.The Gulbenkian museum is ten minutes walk from the front door.For shoppers close by is the Columbo shopping centre two stops away on the metro. Also Dolce Vita you can get the metro Pontinha station a taxi from there is five euros. If u get the metro to Sao Sebastian u have access to a huge Cortes InglesAs business hotels go the staff here are the difference"
Dec 2015,40,"Friendly and efficient staff, convenient location","I have spent 4 nights in Corinthia hotel. Overall it was very good experience. Hotel is conveniently located next to the metro station. you can reach downtown or shopping mall in 10-15 minutes. Rooms were comfortable and nicely decorated. Breakfast was good, but variety of e.g. fruits and local food can be improved further. I was checking out early in the morning before the breakfast starts and was offered nice selection of breakfast food at the coffee point. Efficient and friendly staff."
Dec 2015,40,Home from home!,"Just ended five excellent days at this lovely hotel!Great service, excellent staff, very spacious room with great views of the city; clean bright and fully-functional room and en-suite bathroom; sumptuous breakfast buffet!And the pool and spa were just perfect!Not located in the real centre of town, but with the cheap but  efficient  metro, and rather low-priced taxis, this was not a problem at all!"
Dec 2015,50,Excellent,"Corinthia hotel was an excellent hotel to stay at, i stayed at corinthia for 3 nights and it was the best hotel i have ever stayed in! the service was amazing and the rooms were cleaned 2 times a day! I will definitely be returning!"
Dec 2015,50,Wonderful stay! ,"Second time visiting this lovely hotel and I honestly cannot fault the experience. I booked an Executive Junior Suite through Corinthia.com which guarantees extras including early check in, late check out, free wifi and free room upgrade where available. All of these perks were honoured at check in and we stayed in a large and tasteful Executive Suite on the 22nd floor, with delegate lounge area, guest bathroom and amazing views out over the city. Staff throughout were friendly, helpful and genuinely welcoming, especially in the Executive Lounge - as many have noted this is a must, serving an amazing breakfast (hot and continental, omelettes to order and fizz for mimosas!) and canapés, soft drinks, beer and wine throughout the day. The knowledgable concierge provided great recommendations for restaurants and tours and happily booked these for us. We were also impressed with the Spa staff and hydrotherapy space, which was good value at €20 each and an excellent way to relax. Location was great as many have said - very easy to get the metro across the road, and cabs always available at the hotel. This hotel lives up to the Corinthia reputation and we look forward to returning, obrigado!"
Dec 2015,50,Excellent hotel !!,We enjoyed this hotel and the room with an excellent view to Lizbon.The service was very good and the rooms very clean.The hotel personel are very kind and very helpfull. This hotel is also very close to the metro.
Dec 2015,40,Great,"A good example of what a luxury hotel should be like. The room was good and very clean, the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere in the hotel bar was great, thanks to an amazing piano player. The air-conditioning and heating in the room at the Corinthia was easy to control, which is not always the case in some other luxury hotels."
Dec 2015,50,amazing,"We are very satisfied with the entire organization of the hotel. They met all our requirements. The hall was arranged according to our requirements. The staff is extremely friendly. Special thanks to the lady who was responsible for the event by the hotel - very attentive and responsive.We would have used ""Corinthia"" hotel for our future events.Thank you for the high standard of service."
Dec 2015,50,Luxury in  Lisbon!,"I hasd booked the hotel as part of an annual sojourn I have with 4 firends to different European cities. I had booked 3 twin bedded roooms all on the same floor and given different priority options such as spaciousness, views, double beds, particular floors etc, My own choice of 3 spacious twin bedded rooms on same floor were met but prveneted the hotel upgrading my room as part of the travel website perks I would have enjoyed,  This was immediately explained to me.   However the standard of the rooms was excellent and everyyone in the party commented on how comfortable and spacious they were. Our complimentary buffet breakfast was first class witrh all meanner of options available. The gym was well equippped and the pool proved a calming experience after a workout. The staff were helpful in providing maps, eating out suggestions and travel tips. The large lobby area had plenty of room to relax when waiting for some of the less punctual of our party.  Although the hotel was a bit out of the way (in the business district) , the nearby metro ensured we were in easy quick reach of the city centre. Overall a most enjoyable experience.  One possible suggestion to have made it completely perfect would have been to offer a complimentary drink / bottle of wine to make up for not getting that room upgrade."
Dec 2015,50,Corinthia do it again!,"Once again the Corinthia provided excellent facilities for our conference.  All the staff were very professional, friendly and really made the delegates welcome.  The hotel has an excellent gym, pool and spa complex.  The hotel is well situated for central Lisbon and surrounding areas with tram and train available within about 100 metres."
Dec 2015,50,Beautiful Hotel,"Stayed here December 2015, Staff very helpful and courteous. Our room ( a junior executive suite) was beautiful with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Great location for Metro. 5 star stay"
Dec 2015,30,"Good hotel, extremely expensive.","We're organized an event last week. Very polite hotel staff, excellent breakfast, average rooms and bathroom. Clean. Extremely expensive, especially the hotel bar.Conference facilities and coffee brakes very expensive for the quality of service."
Dec 2015,50,"Corinthia, where Class and Friendlyness meet each other !","We went from 1-5 december to the Corinthia hotel in Lisbon. It was a very good experience for us ! All the people who work there were so nice and professional!  The breakfast and the buffet in the evening was delicious ! We also used the pool and the Spa, which were very nice ! One thing you should try as a couple is a couple massage in the Spa ! We took the Caesar and Cleopatra and it was so good ! The hotel is a bit away from the city centre, but it has a Metro station nearby and there are always taxi's in front of the hotel. We did some trips to the centre and had no difficulties to travel ! (Sorry for my English but I""m actually Dutch ! ^^ )"
Dec 2015,40,IT WAS NICE,"We stayed at this hotel for a week this is a nice hotel it is out of the way form the centre of Lisbon but there is easy access to town from the metro over the road. We went for a junior suit which was ok the view of the viaduct was nice, the room came with free WIFI and one bottle of still water which is replaced when the other is empty there is also a kettle and hair dryer  we had trouble with the aircon not cooling which made the room very hot so we had the window open all the time i did advise reception but nothing changed. The rooms are spotless and the service girls do a fantastic job. the bed was really good and we had no problems sleeping. The bathroom was a good size but lacked a toilet brush and it also did not have a separate shower which i really didnt like the small piece of glass that is meant to be the splash barrier is next to useless this means the floor becomes very slippery when trying to step out of the bath. The breakfast was good but not great. I would recommend one of Rams omelettes they were a highlight. We ate in the restaurant one night it was a buffet and slightly strange how it worked but the food was good i did feel 10.50 for a GnT in the bar was a bit heavy.When we checked out i asked for a taxi there was one outside but the doorman sent it away, i did say that it was fine but he insisted that the taxi left and the called one over from down the road i wish i had refused to get in this car it was disgusting the seats were filthy with stains all over them the car was in no state to be a taxi !! the taxi fare was over 50% more than i paid to get there from the same place i assume this is why the first taxi was sent away this really is not a good look for the hotel. All in all we enjoyed our stay"
Dec 2015,50,"VIP Stay, 5 Star Treatment",We found staff very attentive and concerned to give us the maximum care and service. We expected the most highest excellence and we weren't dissappointed. The room was first class and the food good. Prices for room service are a little expensive is perhaps the only fault from our perspective otherwise we'd recommend this hotel especially for the staff who go the extra mile to make your stay memorable.
Dec 2015,40,Excellent stay!,"Very comfy room in a very stilish 5 * Hotel with excellent service and exceptional breakfast. I worked out in the gym facilitiy and can confirm that is very good, while I didn't use the pool and spa area which looked very tempting. An excellent breakfast was offered."
Dec 2015,50,Business and pleasure in Lisbon,"This is one of the best hotels I ever visited. Service, cleanliness, food - everything was perfect. The only down side is the location, but that isn't a big problem. The underground is across the street and it takes 6 stops to get down town. Across from the hotel is a fantastic fish restaurant and left of that is a small place where you can get pastries, sandwiches and coffee for very little money.The breakfast was fantastic, so was the breakfast service. We did not eat in the hotel, simply because you can get really great food for very reasonable prices down town. If you bypass the typical tourist traps you will find plenty of small places with good food. Just look for where the locals go."
Dec 2015,40,Winter Sun!,"Me and my best friend had a really enjoyable stay at Hotel Corinthia during October. We had a room on one of the upper floors which had amazing views, especially at night. The room was well furnished, and cleaned to a high standard - we particularly liked the chocolate on our beds at the evening turn down service!! The breakfast was varied and had loads of different foods. We also used the pool a fair bit (take your own hat as they charge for one otherwise) which was always quiet so nice for an evening swim. All the members of staff were helpful and gave us some good restaurant recommendations. It is a little way out of town but the metro runs until late, and we always felt safe in the area."
Dec 2015,50,Didnt want to leave,Fabulous service and food. The sky lounge exceeds expectations. The staff are what make this place so special and Daniel and his chef gave us a great information on a different experience of Lisbon.We took their advice and had a fab meal at a restaurant across the river called Altira te and the food was fabulous.This is our second time here and we will return hopefully next year.The restaurant on the ground floor Tipico is excellent value you for money with a real taste of Portuguese food
Nov 2015,50,Fantastic Hotel,"Just stayed in the corinthia hotel and would definitely rebook if need be again it's a great hotel with loads of facilities for that chill factor before you go on holiday there is so many attractions nearby Lisbon Zoo ,Shopping and many great eating places and the location could not be better in regards to transport links"
Nov 2015,50,Great Hotel,I stayed here for one night on a business trip and thought everything about the hotel was great.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  My room was spacious and clean.  Breakfast was awesome.  There were a few good restaurants close to the hotel as well.
Nov 2015,40,A good 4 star hotel by any standards,"10/15 minutes by Taxi from the Waterfront and Centre, the Corinthia met our expectations in full for a 2 night stay last month.  Modern and attractive, the standard rooms are of a good size - meticulously presented and with bath and shower.  Small attractive garden area complete with waterfall and including a smoking area!Buffet breakfast of a good  standard and attentive and friendly Staff - indeed in all parts of the Hotel.Good sized public lounges and attractive indoor pool , with Spa facilities.Would be happy to return.Hotel is about 15 minutes from the Airport by Taxii, assuming the traffic is reasonable"
Nov 2015,50,Perfect luxury hotel in Lisbon!,"Our stay was perfect from the moment of arrival- the attentive staff and the beautiful lobby welcomed us! Our room was spacious and had all of the amenities we needed to relax. The fitness center and spa were immaculate.  We had access to the Executive Lounge, which had amazing views of Lisbon, great food and drinks to enjoy and unwind after a long day. The location, though a bit north of the city center, was easy to navigate and has many restaurants and attractions nearby. We walked down to the water one day, which was about a 5 KM walk but there were many sights to take in along the way. I cannot say enough good things about the staff at the hotel, very friendly and always willing to assist! I look forward to our next visit with Corinthia!"
Nov 2015,50,perfect,wonderful hotel set in the perfect position with all the amenities provided. Excellentpersonnel and staff always go out of their way to assist you.The rooms are very comfortablewith premium bedding and luxurious surroundings.The breakfast was excellent with plenty of choices and variety.
Nov 2015,50,Weekend Break,"Just spent a long weekend break at this hotel booked with British Airways and had a very enjoyable stay. The staff were friendly. Check in was swift and within 10 minutes of arrival we were in our rooms. The rooms are large,  well appointed spotlessly clean. The bathrooms are huge. They have the latest technology as well as bar, complementary dressing gowns slippers, and safe. the hotel also has a swimming pool, spa, gym , restaurants and bars. The hotel is located near the zoological gardens, twin tower area. There is a  metro directly opposites (zoological gardens) which will take you to all parts of the city and to the airport. A 24 HR metro card will cost €6 this will also give you access to buses and trams.  There is a mini supermarket in the metro station itself. The hotel is well worth considering for a long weekend or longer."
Nov 2015,40,A lovely weekend in a top hotel,"We got an exceptional deal on this hotel so came out for a weekend in July. We had a lovely time. The hotel is what you'd expect from a Corinthia - pretty much perfect. Yes it's not the most aesthetically pleasing from the outside but you can't have everything. The rooms are very spacious and clean, and the staff are very friendly and courteous.It's not right in the centre of town but we actually liked that, choosing to jump on the Metro at the station just behind the hotel (Jardim Zoologico) and travelling the 15-20 minutes into the centre from there. The station behind the hotel (Sete Rios) is also perfect for taking the train up to Sintra whiteout having to change anywhere.Overall we enjoyed our stay very much and wouldn't hesitate to come back or to recommend it to anybody travelling to Lisbon."
Nov 2015,40,but the location,"Corinthia Lisbon is a great 5* hotel, nice rooms, great service, a fantastic breakfast buffet, and a grand lobby bar. But the location simply does not Work. A not very charming neighhood, and a 20 minute metro ride to the center of the wonderful city of Lisbon does not work for me."
Nov 2015,50,Very good Hotel,"At the executive club , personnel was highly professional and very friendly.Food  at the club was excellent.Hotel is not close to the city but very close from a subway station.There is also a very good Brazilian Churrascaria restaurant in the street behind the hotel"
Nov 2015,50,Relaxing stay in beautiful hotel,Five night stay for pleasure in Nov 2015.  Whole experience was great.Airport collection was superb.  Check in and bellboy efficient and helpful.  Restaurant food beautiful and best gin and tonic in bar ever.Breakfasts good variety and quality.  A touch more variety would be ideal.Spa areas excellent.Near to airport for transfers.  Near to two metro stations for heading into town.
Nov 2015,50,Excellent hotel,"We had a really awful experience at our first hotel and upgraded to this one. We have no regrets at all with this choice. The hotel was really nice and classy. The staff were ever so helpful, and the whole ambience was amazing. The facilities available were also quite impressive. Those room was so comfortable, we never wanted to leave. Dinner at the hotel was lovely. And the service exquisite. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be going back there real soon."
Nov 2015,50,One of the best hotels in Europe!,"One of the best European hotels and the best ""value for money""! The cost of the suite was similar to the cost of a simple room at other hotels with facilities of less quality. Perfect service and very clean! I stayed at the hotel for business but I will be back with my family for pleasure! Highly recomended!"
Nov 2015,50,Above and beyond.  Wonderful people work here.  Executive floors really worthwhile option.,"Stayed two nights pre-cruise on 22nd floor.  Good location, easy to get to just about anywhere in Lisbon as located 5 mins walk to ""Jardim Zoologico"" Metro station.  Load up a Viva Viagem card with an unlimited 24h Pass and you are away, enjoying unlimited Metro,Funicular, Elevators and bus use.  Taxis are also really affordable in Lisbon.  Although our room was not large by any means, it was tastefully decorated and they treat you like the elite when you check in via an ""executive floor"" Desk in front lobby.  That concierge, or the one on the 24th floor were always willing to help with visitors' advice and restaurant recommendations.  The executive lounge had excellent breakfasts with an egg station.  Beer and wine as well as goodies throughout the day as well.Where the hotel shined for us was after we became victims of pickpockets, the concierge desk and staff went out of the way to help us deal with notifying our banks, embassies and describing how to report the crime to the tourist police.  They let us use their phones without complaints and were genuinely as devastated as we were that the incident took place at all.  When we were not 100% sure that we would be able to board our cruise ship and leave Lisbon, and might have to return to the hotel to wait out the weekend, they promised to fiind us another room at the cheapest rate on the executive floor if we had to stay.There are not enough stars to grade them by in terms of service and attitude.  I could mention individual names : Rute, Sofia, Marta, but that would risk omissions of others who were equally charming and hardworking.  Those two guys running the executive lounge worked longer hours than many people can imagine and always were smiling and attentive in their jobs.The Corinthia Hotel management should be supremely proud of their personnel!"
Nov 2015,50,Business Trip to Lisbon With Personal Time Added On,"My corporate department held it's annual world-wide conference at this property in October 2015 and we all were impressed with this property.  The staff and service here is incredibly efficient, excellent and thoughtful.  They anticipate every need and we all commented on how nice the staff and the people of Portugal were in general.  I've traveled to Europe several times so I prepared myself for a smaller, more ""efficient"" room.  I was thrilled when I entered my room to find a huge suite-like space with a king-size bed, desk for work, and a complete sitting area with a sofa, coffee table and chairs. It was much larger than most U.S. standard rooms. The bathroom was beautiful and spacious.  Our meetings were held in several rooms and they were well appointed, large and technologically wired.  The daily breakfast was delicious and the selection vast.  We had our first dinner buffet there and it was delicious.  I also ate there one evening after the conference and the Tapas restaurant was very good. There are some restaurants and shops within walking distance and the Zoo is right down the street which I visted.  The price point is amazingly reasonable for such a well-appointed and beautiful property. The downtown area and main attractions are a 10 minute cab ride away.  I would highly recommend this property to anyone visiting this beautiful City."
Nov 2015,50,good,"I had a good time during in stay in your hotel.I hope to have another trip to lisbon and visit your hotel .wi-fi internet was perfect with high speed.elevator were good service .breakfat was fine.unfourrnately,my trip was short and i couldnt using of fitness and pool."
Nov 2015,40,Great place to stay at,"Great place to stay at. A bit far from center, but with a very close metro Station. The structure looks new, and there area lots of restaurants in The immediate neighbours. Rooms over 10th floor are panoramic, vith amazing all-side-long windows."
Nov 2015,50,An excellent hotel!,Just a perfect hotel on a perfect place. Near the city and very close to the metro station. The staff is very helpful. The hotel has all the facility's you need. We go to this hotel again for sure! Our compliments.
Nov 2015,40,Comfortable but not a luxary hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in a buisiness visit to Lisbon. The hotel has a unique high building compared to surrounding, with reasonably good location. staff pleasant and wellcoming and helpful. looby is spacious and fantastic decoration. Rooms are of reasonable size with comfortable beds and pillows. Decoration is standard and has nothing special and decoration is standard also. and bathrooms also standard without any additive touch to a 5 star hotel. no coffee or tea maker, they supply complimentary bottle of water daily. Free wifi allover the hotel with high speed. Breakfast area is excellent but food varieties are limited. The hotel is comfortable but has no luxiourious touch to a 5* hotel."
Nov 2015,50,Worth it for the Indoor Pool and Spa with Kids,"Needed a Hotel to make sure kids get some pool time in Lisbon in end October. Corinthia towers was the choice. We enjoyed the stay. They rooms are spacious and good for a 7 days stay. Amenities might not match 5 star standards but really worth the price. It is possible to use the public transport (metro), some nice restaurants close by, both at the front and back entrance.The Spa is worth using as the entry is inexpensive if you are a guest.The pool of course was the highlight  as is kids friendly but does not have a lifeguard. After a day of sightseeing, it was nice to take a dip with the kids. They are very strict about pool caps, so make sure you take yours along. Or you have to buy one at €5 per piece. Staff is friendly and good at service."
Nov 2015,50,Top notch in everything,"The conference facilities, rooms and catering are excellent. The staff is very nice and helpful. Breakfast is amazing. I have never been in a better hotel of this type. The room was large and clean, the bathroom comfortable. Lots of closet space and a nice view of the bridge."
Nov 2015,40,"Great hotel, quite far from centre","The hotel is great - lovely room, very comfy bed and great service. The only downside is that it's slightly far away from the hustle and bustle of lisbon city centre. It's easy to get to using the metro (blue line), but we always had to travel back after our evening meal as we didn't really find much in the local area."
Nov 2015,40,Amazing,"I spent in Lisbon less than one day for a meeting. Very comfortable hotel, clean and quite for a good rest. I would  suggest this hotel indeed. Very kind personnel, clean and beautiful rooms, I had a good experience."
Nov 2015,50,Nice hotel ,"We stayed for 4 nights, the rooms are good size, staff are friendly. They even folded my cloths and lay on the bed. The Only thing is lack of counter space on the sink. Hightly recommended hotel for stay."
Nov 2015,50,THX ..,relaxed stay at this hotel .. friendly people . very delicious food . and an unforgetable massage . good view from excecutive lounge . absolotely brilliant stay . thx to the entire crew . and spepially to ruben!
Nov 2015,40,Great stay,"It is a hotel that could be called ""The Isle of Tranquility"". Magnificent views over the city, calm and great quality in all the spaces. Ideal for a congress. Far from the city center rush yet close enough to get there easily. And very close to the airport"
Nov 2015,50,Heading home,"Heading home to Lagos after a few days in London we stayed three nights in this hotel.excellent decor and cleanliness.a little out of town but metro across the road, also bars and restaurants near so not isolated. Good hotel happy with the price we paid."
Nov 2015,40,One of best EMEA hotels,"Friendly people, great food, proper room sizes.  I always have rule about hotels and it starts with clean, good bed, good shower, and comfortable room size (no need to be huge)....  I generally find most EMEA based hotels lack in these areas and the Corinthia was a great surprise.  I will stay here again."
Nov 2015,40,Good value and very comfortabkr,"very nice hotel, 100 mtr from metro, railway and busstation. comfortable rooms, with the best beds ever experianced in a hotel. breakdast with € 20,- overpriced, same goes for wellness area. exellent service from the staff"
Nov 2015,50,"beautiful hotel, great stay","we stayed here throughout our lisbon trip and our hotel room was lovely, spacious and comfortable. most importantly clean. it is close by to a train station. so it was great for us traveling around town. there were a lot of restaurants around the hotel too. so the location was really ideal. the staff there were also very nice and helpful. all in all it was a great stay there and we would gladly return"
Nov 2015,40,Lovable,Our experience it was really nice. That was our first cuples journey; since the first day we arrived we met a really kind members of the team and also when we had some difficult with the language every body was ready to help us. Go on Corinthia!
Nov 2015,50,Excellent  hotel,Fantastic hotel. On the whole excellent  service  apart from a few problems with maintenance noise in a joining  room and key fobs for room and lift on arrival. Most staff were lovely and Monica and Daniel were superb.
Nov 2015,40,"Lovely hotel, clean with friendly staff",Hotel is located on the outskirts of Lisbon in a fairly commercial area which is fairly close to the centre of town and close to the zoo. There is a train station less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel which takes you straight into town and taxis are between €6 and €8 into central Lisbon.  Hotel staff are all very helpful and friendly and the hotel bar is relaxing and has live music. The chocolates they give you in reception are Delish!
Nov 2015,50,Best Hotel In Lisbon,"One of the best hotels I have stayed in.  Were helpful in every way.  I hadn't booked the upgrade, but they allowed me to upgrade at expired price on check-in.  Air conditioning didn't seem to work, but they fixed it very quickly.  Even gave me birthday cake and champagne on my birthday.  Everything about this hotel is classy, and I would strongly recommend."
Nov 2015,30,Average Stay,Room is comfortable; lighting:could be improved. Staff at reception helpful & friendly. The live Cockroach at the lunch buffet did dampen the experience -food hygiene & safety problem - ? cleanliness.
Nov 2015,20,Corinthia hotel lisbon,"The Corinthian London has become our go-to hotel when in the UK, having stayed there over a dozen times since it opened. Given our excellent experience in London, we expected the same quality of property in Lisbon. The Corinthia Lisbon was a big disappointment. It can be best described as a convention/airport type property. The guest suites were worn and threadbare. The breakfast buffet was like a cattle call. The dining room ( if you can call it that) main feature was a buffet in a loud, cold, noisy room that lacked atmosphere. The staff was friendly and helpful."
Nov 2015,40,Really nice place to stay :-),"Really nice place to stay :-) strongly recomended, good localization, Just 3 min From metro station and railway station.not far From the Airport.nearby the zoo garden.nice swimning pool.nice hotel!!!!"
Nov 2015,40,Great hotel - OK staff,"We travelled 3 Friends this past weekend and we booked this great hotel with amazing facilities.The hotel as such is fantastic! nice decoration, fresh flowers, big rooms, enourmous bathroom! I loved the fact that part of the mirror did not tarnish, amazing to put your make up on even if you just had a hot shower.The security is very high as well, since you can only use your door key to go to the common areas or your room level. AMAZING!The down side is that all the ladies in the reception seemed a bit rude. Not only with us but with all the guests.  Maybe it is a cultural thing? no excuse though as it is a 5 star hotel... I have to say that you have a shining star at the reception : Joao. He is extremely nice and very polite. He always helped us in any doubt we had with a smile. Thank you, Joao! Gonçalo is very nice too :)Overall we had a great stay. Thank you!"
Nov 2015,50,Amazing stay,Everything absolutely amazing. Comfy and clean. Amazing views from top floors and big room with massive bed!Really enjoyed our stay Modern but classy nice bar and nice putside space.Very enjoyable Would return
Nov 2015,40,Big Rooms,This Hotel is the best hotel I stayed on during our recent trip. The rooms are big and comfortable with a view of the aqueduct. Centrally located and access to public transportation is easy. The breakfast is also good
Nov 2015,50,Corinthia Hotel Lisbon,Excellent staff and service!  Club atmosphere outstanding.  Highly recommend staying at club level. They will assist with tours in the area as well. Interesting buffet restaurant for dinner.  A nice neighborhood surrounds the hotel with some small restaurant offerings.
Nov 2015,50,Fantastic Hotel - Highly Recommended,"I stayed at Corinthia Hotel, Lisbon with three girlfriends for three nights in October. We had a fantastic time. The service was second to none. The staff so friendly, they could not do enough to help us. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.Thank you sooooo much for a fantastic stay.Muito obrigada"
Nov 2015,50,City Break in Lisbon,"This is an excellent modern hotel and very conveniently located, very close to Metro Station and Railway Station. The staff are all very friendly, welcoming and efficient. There are lots of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. Centro Colombo is only 3 stops away on Metro, excellent for retail therapy and choice of eateries"
Nov 2015,50,Good place to stay in Lisbon,"Very good, clean and comfortable hotel, nice rooms, quick and free WiFi available everywhere, great and very helpfull staff, very nice breakfast. Location - 1 minute from metro station. Good value for money!"
Nov 2015,50,we love corinthia hospitality,First class service from time we arrived - we would recommend  executive level which is excellent..  You are so thoroughly spoilt and have all the extras making it feel extra special.Our one negative was location - The hotel is not situated in hub of tourist centre but with careful planning this is not a problem as the Metro is opposite hotel.  If you have the confidence to use it buy tickets and just go. We did not find it hard after doing our first trip.Our special thanks to Marta on executive reception & Daniel & monica on executive sky lounge Brilliant
Nov 2015,50,Excellent service,Perfect situated hotel near the metro. From the moment you enter the lobby you will experience a very high level of service. All the staff are there for you and help you with alle the wishes you might have. The guestservice was very helpful to make reservations for us. The Executive lounge was great and the service excellent. I will not forget the cake on my birthday. I will recommend this hotel and will look forward visiting the hotel again.

They make the food in front of you and it's so reasonable fresh produce.Rooms 10!!! I was upgraded for a junior suite well impressedAlways choose 18 floor best viewsRelaxingBreakfast AMAZING choicesQuality food quality staffEnables me to practice my Portuguese they are helpfulForget Any negative reviews this hotel is my second home when we visit Pure class
Nov 2015,50,hair dryer,"My wife had to use the hairdryer with the electric plug on one side of the bathroom door and the mirror on the other side, the wire from the plug barely reached which made drying her hair rather difficult surely there has got to be a better way, perhaps a mirror on the writing desk. Mr R Patten"
Nov 2015,50,Excellent Hotel,"We booked this hotel for a city break weekend and were not disappointed. On the contrary we were extremely please. Although a little way out of the city centre we were able to walk there and a taxi takes about 10 minutes, with the metro station a couple of minutes walk. The hotel itself is very welcoming, well decorated and extremely clean. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The beds are queen/king size and very comfortable. The staff, from receptionists, cleaners, waitresses, concierge and bar staff are friendly and efficient - although a little leisurely - but who really cares when you are on holiday!! There are a range of bars including the external terrace which offer a good selection of drinks at not unreasonable prices. Breakfast is very good, with an excellent selection of dishes, both hot and cold. The pool is very good - although you are required to wear swimming caps. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to try the Spa. Altogether a fine experience and I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel."
Nov 2015,40,Hotel with one of the best SPA and gym of Lisbon in a fantastic location for business trips,"Good service and nice outdoor bar. This hotel has a large indoor pool that is partially open in the summer, a nice gym and a fantastic SPA with acqua circuit. For business travelers it has a great location in the middle of the business district"
Nov 2015,40,Reasonable,"A nice and quiet Hotel to stay for a couple of nights. Nice and comfortable room, reasonable location, close to the airport and more for business.Professional and good people serving.Exterior is very beautiful and there are 2 excellent restaurants."
Nov 2015,50,Excellent city hotel,"First class city hotel. We had an Executive room which was very comfortable and quiet and gave us access to breakfast in the Sky Lounge which was excellent. We also had use of the Sky Lounge during our stay for complementary snacks and drinks in a luxurious environment. The hotel staff took guest service seriously and we were impressed by the friendly and professional checkin in/out and other services. We were treated to sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries in our room on our return from our day out to help celebrate my birthday. Lovely touch and a special treat.As we only had 2 nights in Lisbon and we wanted to see as much of the city as we could and the weather was glorious, we did not make use of the hotel's other facilities. However, we will be back as the city has so much more for us to see and we will stay at the Corinthea Hotel again."
Nov 2015,40,Lovely hotel...but what makes it 5 star?,"Elegant lobby, good service.  Rooms nice, but some of the furniture in our room on the 19th floor looked worn and scratched.  Door cards didn't work 3 out of the 4 days of our stay.  Housekeeping was excellent. Bed very comfy.  Large bathroom. Great views from the room.I've never stayed in a 5 star hotel before, but I'm not sure what makes this 5 star - it's on a par with many 4 star hotels i've stayed in.Good location close to two metro stops."
Nov 2015,40,All you need in welcoming Lisbon,"Good hotel, although little far away from the Center. Staff all welcoming and reflecting the Lisbon welcoming general attitude. We got a suite matching need and expectation. Contemporary decoration and the right services all there. Place to go back to."
Nov 2015,50,Can't Beat It,"Another business stay,  This time with a twist.  I love Portuguese wine,  When I went down to the bar, I asked for vinho tinto (red wine).  The bar tender asked from what region,  She gave me a tasting of three wines.  First time I have this encounter at the Corinthia.  Either way, a lasting impression,  Obrigado, Duoro,  The staff was great as usual.  The breakfast was excellent.  It was too short a trip."
Nov 2015,40,A Lovely Treat,"My boyfriend and I arrived a little flustered from a rainy walk to the hotel from our previous residence and were greeted by very friendly staff who offered to help with our bags and get us checked in.When we were at the reception, they asked us to take a seat with a lovely woman at guest services who gave us port and chocolate and told us we'd been upgraded to a junior suite since we were there to celebrate our anniversary. It was such a kind gesture and a really lovely surprise which enhanced the whole visit.We used the aqua area of the spa that evening and found it peaceful and relaxing. Our room was clean, comfortable and had a beautiful view of the city- also nice and quiet at night so we slept soundly! Room service was delicious and promt- can't really fault the service from all the staff. They were helpful, informative and great at suggesting things to do in and around Lisbon. There's a train/metro station just across the road which makes getting anywhere a little further away (such as Sintra- highly recommended) very simple and stress free. Would visit again any time."
Nov 2015,40,Enjoyable 1st time in LIsbon,"This is a lovely hotel but it's a bit too far out from the main town although it's only a few minutes away from a metro stop and the metro is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, I stayed in a room on the 17th floor and so I had great views. Checking in and out was very quick and smooth and the staff were very professional throughout, the only downside was that although there was a great choice of food for breakfast, the cooked food wasn't very hot other than that I would highly recommend it and would definitely stay again"
Nov 2015,30,Entirely adequate ,"Our plane was grounded so British Airways put us up here while they found a man with a spanner.  There was a well-stocked buffet of tasty dishes to choose from. We'd taken taxis rather than wait for the BA bus (so we could get rooms and food quickly), but they did keep resupplying the buffet when the others arrived. They're used to air crew and others leaving early so reception was well staffed at 0515The lift is high-tech requiring your room card and you to select the floor required. It then directs you to one of the four lifts. This did seem to defeat a lot of guests and there were no instructions so people were having to ask staff. The WiFi password is personal but you have to phone and ask for it.  Seems unnecessary and complicated. There were three power sockets for the multiple devices we all carry.  One at the back of the wardrobe (?), one on the floor by the door (for the cleaner) and one behind the desk so you have to pull it away from the wall.   Why?There was plinky-plonky muzak playing in the bathroom. I eventually found a volume control to turn it down (but not off) low down and opposite the loo. Some of my colleagues didn't find it. Irritating. The bed was good."
Nov 2015,50,F.Clark London,the staff at the hotel were superb went there for my wifes birthday on the night went back to the room to find bottle of champagne and a lovely cake looked after us like we was the only people staying there the rooms and everything about the hotel were 5 star would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a break in Lisbon ten out of ten we will be going back
Nov 2015,50,Enjoyable stay,This hotel made my recent four day seminar very enjoyable. Very helpful and friendly staff and the suroundings made everything comfortable with the conference rooms easy to find. Would love to come back with family.
Nov 2015,50,Luxury hote,"Booked for me for a conference. The location was s but further out, but super hotel. Room was very spacious and comfortable. Quality products in bathroom and hospitality tray. Breakfast , lovely choice of well cooked food. Lots of seating and areas to chill. Would definitely return"
Nov 2015,40,Stayover in Lisbon - make it Luxury,The Corinthia is a very nice 5 star hotel with wonderful bedding (pillows are a bit hard ask housekeeping for softer ones) and beautiful city views of the Golden Gate bridge.  The interiors are gorgeous.
Nov 2015,30,Disappointing :(,"Sad to say although great staff and very nice reception the room of this hotel was the same as many other city hotels. Bland. Holes in the bed linen is a new experience for me at this standard of hotel, even the change of bed linen had a hole! No trouser press, odd when this hotel is in a business district! Quite a way to the City center and cab's are a necessity, lot's of main roads! Not a lot in close proximity. Once out of this hotel we did not return until late evening. Anyone looking for a City break would be far better looking for a hotel off the main shopping road, attractions of Lisbon would be within walking distance with many shops and restaurants. Although staff at The Corinthia where very pleasant, helpful and friendly we will not be returning to this hotel :("
Nov 2015,50,Lovely hotel and staff,"I usually prefer to choose hotels that are very clean and have spa service. I enjoyed staying here. The spa is beautiful, the hotel has an outside terrace, inside restaurant and coffee corner. I was a very good experience. I highly recommend this hotel when you are planning to visit Lisbon."
Nov 2015,50,Ideal for a visit to Lisbon,"Stayed here post a cruise and we were not disappointed. Junior suite was luxurious, bathroom needs a refurb. Housekeeping excellent. Very good meals in the bar on arrival, excellent dinner buffet and breakfast. Ladies and gentlement at reception and guest services desk were extremely helpful. We had to return to the hotel due to flight cancellations and we were accommodated immediately. Short taxi ride to city centre. All in all thoroughly recommended."
Nov 2015,40,"Big hotel, nice spa, not near centre but great district for food","we got a good deal on this hotel though I was concerned how far out of the centre it is.  We got the tour bus and had to walk to the bus stop and back.  So if you want to just be right next to everything this is not for you. but if you don't mind getting taxis or buses it adds to being in lisbon.  The hotel is in a great area for food too.  We ate japaonese (12 euros all you can eat), brazililan, the local cafe up the road serves amazing food and the best chocolate mousse i've ever had.  There's even a charity clothes shop up the road if you fancy a cheap shop!  We went to the spa too. It wasn't cheap (EURO 20) but we were the only ones in there and it was peaceful.  We had a relaxing time at this hotel."
Nov 2015,50,An Unexpected Delight in Lisbon,"I booked this hotel through Expedia and hadn't realised that Corinthia had a hotel in Lisbon. As a keen visitor to Malta I was aware of the brand but hadn't experienced it before. We were certainly glad that we did select this hotel and were definitely not disappointed. The evening before we flew out there I received a call from the hotel offering me use of the Executive Club or upgrade to a junior suite, both for reasonable costs. I opted for the junior suite at an additional EU29.00 per night. This was probably one of the nicest hotel rooms we have stayed in, and we travel quite extensively. Unfortunately we got stuck behind a group who were checking in just ahead of us which meant that we had a 15 minute wait to check in. However we were given a warm welcome by Mauro and were intrigued when he showed us how to operate the lifts - not seen that before, but a good job he showed us. The room was on the 16th floor, quite spacious and had everything that we needed, although for the first time ever, I forgot to take a European adaptor. Not to worry though, room service whisked one up to our room in about 10 minutes. The room was a pleasure to come back to each evening and we would have been happy to spend more time there. The bed was huge and very comfortable. There was a good range of toiletries and a complimentary bottle of mineral water each day. We had breakfast each morning and were delighted with the range of choices on offer. We did eat in the dining room one evening for the chef's buffet which offered a broad choice of tasty options. Throughout our stay we were continually impressed by the care and attitude that the staff had, something you can't say about so many hotels. I know some people find the location a bit far out of the centre of Lisbon, however we managed to walk it in about 25 minutes even with the uphill bits. However, we did make use of the nearby metro which eased the journey. We also used the above ground train from the same station to get to Sintra, not too far away and well worth a visit. There are a few restaurants in the local area that offer a variety of cuisine but you really need to go down town to take advantage of a wider selection. I would certainly stay in this hotel again should we decide to take another city break in Lisbon and will look at other Corinthia hotels on our travels in future."
Nov 2015,40,Nice stay,"Nice hotel, excellent staff, reasonable prices. Excellent facilities - indoor pool and spa. Good location near to metro or short taxi into centre. Business hotel/area, would opt for more central hotel as a tourist."
Nov 2015,50,Great place,"My review is based on 17 years of experience working in three hotels  located in middle of Manhattan, NewYork. front desk: clerks are very nice and helpful .Room: Large rooms , very  clean, nice bathroom.Pool: small, great for the kids not Adult Gym: I wouldn't call this a gym - waste of time.Location: 5 subway stops from old town ."
Nov 2015,50,very good,We had a lovely stay. Not long enough. Everyone other than the spa were great. very helpful staff. We would highly recommend to everyone. Easy to get into town. Service was great. Executive club fabulous.
Oct 2015,50,Well positioned for a City Break,Spent a nice week here last week.  Accommodation is excellent and the service superb.  Breakfast was good but would be outstanding if the hot food were hotter (the hotplates keep it tepid at most) but the chef will cook you a great fried egg or omelette and the tea and coffee is great.  Lots of nice cakes too!.  The hotel is very close (1 min walk) to Sete Rios / Jardin Zoologico train and metro stations so handy for city centre access and for the train to Sintra.  Lots of bus-stops outside too.  The Gulbenkian Museum is a 10 min walk away and the zoo 5 mins.  Both are heartily recommended.Scored sleep quality as average but the beds were fantastic - lowered score as the A/c was not very efficient (even in October the room was too warm) and it goes off again when you leave the room so you can't cool it to your desired temp while you are out.
Oct 2015,50,Family stay,"Enjoyed a lot our stay, nice hotel, friendly staff, location is a bit out of center, but metro is just 2 min away and in good weather we even walked to Baixa; if you don't want to pay for breakfast (20 E/person), there are few nice cafes on the same street, where you can have one instead:)"
Oct 2015,50,Another stay at Lisbon!,"this was the second time we were in Lisbon and we really enjoyed staying in this hotel. We chose this one because we stayed in Corinthia Hotel Budapest before.This one in Lisbon is more modern style, but still our style!...We loved it. the only inconvenience we had there was when we went to swim, they make you buy a cap for the pool. I have been in several hotels and this never was something mandatory. Anyway we did buy it, but it seem like a rule to get some money.Breakfast is nice and you have many options, for us it was well located and we have a nice view of the Acueducto!...I recommend it!"
Oct 2015,40,Corinthia review,Very good hotel in particular service and cleanliness. We were however dissapointed by the noise: we could hear every time the room next door had a shower or a bath and corridor noise. Also not central
Oct 2015,50,"Nice hotel, easy travel to city centre","We had a lovely stay in the hotel, which is beautiful. Rooms were good sized, clean and with a comfortable bed. The breakfast was amazing with a great veriety of food. The  hotel is 20 mins from the airport , taxi costing around 27 euros. It's  easy to get into town by metro station 3-4 mins walk or taxi 8 euro. The pool was good however the spa steam room etc were at a charge of 20 euros per person which was unacceptable. I would certainly recommend this hotel but if the spa was included, (like it is in most other hotels) it would have certainly been a 5star stay."
Oct 2015,40,very good,this is avery good hotel placed very near the metro station and only 3 stops from down town.its all very well equiped nice rooms and comfortable and spacious places to eat or drink.breakfast is great having all you can ask for +omelets to be cooked  at your presence with a choice of 6 ingreediants to add. go there
Oct 2015,50,"Excellent value for money, large modern hotel","Location: somewhat away from the historical centre, but taxis are cheap and there is a subway station nearbyPremises: very new and efficient, with very nice lounge outside of the main bar. The hotel is fairly large, so it's not a boutique type of place and you might want to avoid the tour crowds...  The indoor pool is large but the water might be too cold for some people.Room: very spacious, efficient and with everything in good working condition, with large clean bathroom; WiFi fast and reliableBreakfast: served on the top floor if you have a Premier/Deluxe room, with good choice of items; the great view is certainly a plus to start your day, be it for business or pleasureService: friendly and very efficientOverall, very good value for money."
Oct 2015,50,Love this hotel - another wonderful visit here,This is my second visit to his hotel. It certainly ticks all my boxes. From check in - to leaving everyone was so friendly and helpful. The rooms were nice and spacious with a lovely view across to the ancient aquaduct - and always nice and quiet - with a right cosy bed (pillow a bit of a let down though!)  All facilities that you would expect to find in a fine hotel.The best as always was delicious and we stayed here for a week and found that given the wide selection of good quality fare - that we never got bored with what was on offer. The gentleman who made the most fantastic omlettes for us - with also a joyful start to the day - always smiling and cheery! What a delight! Indeed - all the staff on duty in the breakfast room were very attentive and friendly- and you need to hang onto your plate as it was often whisked away. I loved the crockery - high quality items; all beautful Villeroy & Boch plates and cups. All the public areas were clean and beautifully presented with fabulous flower arrangements. All very restful and classic design. The location was good too - just next to a metro stop and your could easily take a trip out of the center to Sintra from the station a few minutes away. Perhaps - a lack of decent restaurants nearby but if you are aware of that you can eat downtown and jump on the metro or easily get a taxi back. Easy to return to the airport - taxis all outside the hotel and you are there in 10 - 15 minutes. Well - would I recommend this - the question I always ask - would I come back here... the answer is yes! this was my second visit her - and certainly would book a third stay for next year. Never had any problems - was just a nice relaxing stay... What else do you need? Thanks to all the staff for making it such a lovely experience. PS two quick stops down the Metro there is a huge supermarket at San Sebastio... very handy if you were planning to go on a wee picnic in one of the lovely parks in Lisbon. See you all next year!
Oct 2015,50,"Perfect in every way! Accommodation, food, location, facilities, access...","We had a great time at Corinthia during our stay here for our Autumn holiday. The junior suite we booked was spacious with a king bed and ample space for an extra bed. Good sized bathroom with bathrobes, towels and toiletries. We were in the 7th floor, and room was whisper quiet in the night for a good night's sleep and beds were very comfortable. The housekeeping staff were excellent, the room was made up to perfection each time. And the chocolates every evening were so yummm too!The location of the hotel couldn't be better. Under 20€ from the airport by taxi. The Jardim Zoologico Metro stop is a 5 min walk from the hotel and it is the on the blue line which takes you to the centre of Lisbon within 20 min! The long distance train station - Sete Rios was 2 floors above the metro station and was perfect for our trips to Sintra. Taxis were always available right outside the hotel every time we came out of the hotel too. And the hop hop off bus stop was only a 7 min walk (in front of Lisbon Zoo)Breakfast was fantastic with a huge choice - cold meats, pastries, toast, muesli, fruits, juices, coffee.... even some cold Portuguese fish dishes and a hot food counter for omelettes, waffles....  and many more. We had dinner once at the Tipico restaurant which was 29€ per head for a buffet including a glass of wine! Very good Portuguese tapas dishes here! Moreover, there were quite a few restaurants to choose from with half km from the hotel. Pool and gym were in the second floor which we used only once during our stay were very good too. The wifi connection was very good in our room and all the around the hotel which we frequented.They even provided an umbrella for a rainy day during the stay! Would come back here with no hesitation. Highly recommended. Could anything be better? Perhaps more English channels on TV."
Oct 2015,50,Great Accomodations,I have been staying at the Corinthian for some time now and it gets getting even better. The staff are like family now and they are always interested in your well being. They always remember your name even if the time period is long between stays. Great place.
Oct 2015,50,Relaxing and comfortable,"A quiet, calm environment with helpful staff. Comfortable room with all you could need. Lots of facilities which although we did not use all looked excellent.Close to metro with easy journey to Central Lisbom."
Oct 2015,50,Excellent hotel,"I booked this hotel for a long weekend for my partner's 30th as a surprise. I contacted guest services prior to my arrival with some special requests for the occasion and had plenty of other questions! The hotel was very friendly and efficient in responding to my emails and on arrival everything had been arranged and was managed in a professional and discreet manner! My partner was very pleasantly surprised and happy with all arrangements (champagne in room on arrival with personalised note, reservations for dinner that night, cake provided). The hotel itself was very nice, the staff were very friendly and attentive. The quality of the food and drinks in the restaurants and executive lounge was excellent, and I would recommend a stay here. The only downside was that swimming pool was quite cold, but otherwise a nice place to sit and relax!"
Oct 2015,40,Nice hotel,I stayed at Corinthia Hotel Lisbon for one night in October of 2015. It is a good solid 4 star hotel. The hotel is a bit far from the city center however there is a Metro line very close to the hotel.
Oct 2015,40,Good to return to this hotel,"My first staty in hotel Corinthia was during a venue in the hotel in 2008. This time there was an event in Lisbon which brought me back. My good experiences in the hotel in 2008 were reconfirmed during this stay. In summary: very good facilities and service, friendly and helpful staff."
Oct 2015,50,A Hotel You Don't Want To Leave!,"We decided to make our first visit to Portugal after hearing such good reports about Lisbon and when we found the Corinthia to be offering reasonable room rates, well, we just had to go!  Although not in the city centre, the location of this hotel makes it very easy for both the airport and all of Lisbons attractions; approximately 15 minutes taxi to the airport and 15 - 20 minutes metro to the city centre, the metro and railway stations both being only a few minutes walk from the hotel.We arrived quite late, after midnight, but the staff were all very obliging and helpful and the bar was open until 01.00 so we popped in for a nightcap!  When we went to our room, the porter came with us explaining in very good English exactly how to use the lifts (no buttons with floor numbers; clients swipe their room keycards, enter the floor number and the lift makes it own way, vice versa on the way down and the control panel in the hallway tells you which lift will come first!).  We had an Executive room which was on the 21st floor with spectacular views of the aqueduct and the suspension bridge over the river in the distance.  Having stayed in the Corinthia in St. Petersburg in the past,  we felt our room this time to be a little small in comparison without the features in the bathroom there was in St. Petersburg i.e. the bath was a lot smaller, no separate shower only the one over the bath however these things were compensated by the mirror being heated so that it didn't steam up!  The hair drier couldn't be plugged in near enough to a mirror anywhere in the room which made for difficult hair drying; the space between the wardrobes and the bathroom was narrow so if the wardrobe doors were open, which they had to be to use the Nespresso machine, then two people couldn't pass but, hey ho, we managed!Executive room clients have access to the wonderful Executive Lounge on the 24th floor, which we could also use for breakfast instead of the breakfast room on the ground floor.  This is such a fantastic bonus!  The Executive Lounge is open all day where there are complimentary drinks, both alcoholic and otherwise, and hor d'oeuvres freely available.We found the staff throughout the hotel exceptional.  Absolutely nothing is too much trouble, from the chef in the Executive Loungex cooking any flavour omelette, fried egg or whatever anybody required to the doorman hailing a taxi; from the restaurant maitre d' ensuring the number of stairs down to the toilets weren't too many (!!) to the oh so helpful barman helping us decide which port which should try!  This is such a wonderful hotel and we will have no hesitation staying in one again.Once again, thank you Corinthia!"
Oct 2015,50,Weekend break,"Spent the weekend here early October 15, found the staff to be very helpful (Lilla). Most spoke excellent English . Found it to be a good place to stay as its close to the metro, there are some very good restaurants nearby. Definitely worth having a meal in the hotels own restaurant,we found the standard to be very good ."
Oct 2015,50,Beautiful Hotel,"Clean and modern hotel. Bedroom had great views. Great location and friendly professional staff.  Breakfast was good.Great wifi. Close to Metro, Coach station, Lisbon hop on hop off sightseeing bus stop and Zoo. The airport is only 20 minutes away from the hotel. You could get bus 96 (Aerobus) cost €3.50 from the airport bus stand 2 which brings you outside the hotel."
Oct 2015,50,Wonderful hotel and exceptional staff.,"The staff at this hotel are all very professional, without being pompous or obsequious.  Their help and friendliness enhanced our first visit to Lisbon.  The Executive Lounge is an oasis of calm after a hard day sightseeing and the snacks and drinks provided are  excellent.  Local transport is nearby and easy to use, but if in doubt ask the staff, they will always point you in the right direction!"
Oct 2015,50,Fantastic hotel,"Didn't want to leave. Really lovely hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Amazing breakfast selection and very comfortable bedroom. Loved the double sinks in the bathroom. Excellent upgrading offers. Hotel isn't central but don't let that stop you from picking it, it's right beside a metro stop and taxis are ridiculously cheap and easy to get. Loved our stay here!"
Oct 2015,30,Average,"Had a conferenceReception: 10/10Bell boys: 7/10Breakfast quality: 5/10Plates smell: 2/10 ( smells like eggs )Cleanliness of the room: 4/10 ( bed cover was dirty, duvet was ripped )Bathroom cleanliness: 8/10Room carpeting: 5/10Bar cocktails : 5/10 over pricedBar service: 5/10Banquets service: 7/10Overall it is an average HotelNothing majour to mention other the disgusting smell of the plates. ( fyi you can use white vinegar to remove this smell )Thank you and best regards"
Oct 2015,50,Beautiful hotel well located ,"I spent 5 nights in this hotel for business purposes. The rooms are really big ( I had a  suite) very clean, and quite. The bed has a good quality mattress and is really big. The reception employees are really friendly  and helpful ... I advise you a visit to The zoo that is 10 min walking distance from the hotel. The train station and metro are only 2 min from there and it's cheap to get to the center of Lisbon and only takes 15 min. The breakfast is open really late, they serve real coffees, cappuccinos and you can have English and continental food... I highly recommend that hotel for your trip in the capital of Portugal !"
Oct 2015,40,Excellent all round but bathroom niggles,"This is an excellent hotel in every way you would want but I am reluctantly unable to give 5 stars because of silly bathroom niggles (see later).The location is great, not absolutely central but 3 minutes from both train & metro stations, bus routes front & rear including HOHO routes and plentiful taxis outside.We met Reuben the manager who obviously keeps a very happy staff as they were all attentive, friendly and efficient at all times.We booked an executive room and were very glad we did so as this gave access to the exclusive top floor lounge where food & drink, including alcohol, were available all day from the excellent buffet breakfast onwards. We didn't spend a penny extra! We owe particular thanks to the exec lounge staff for looking after my wife's dietary needs as she has a serious dairy allergy.The room itself was very clean and comfortable especially the bed & pillows.The silly niggles then :For the life of me I cannot understand why an excellent 5* hotel cannot provide a soap dish in the shower! You are forced to put your stuff on the bath edge and it's swept away if the shower hits it.Also, maybe more importantly, the bottom of the bath was very slippery with no apparent ridging and no mat provided. This is a health and safety issue which should be addressed urgently.Otherwise, as stated, excellent in every other way and we would certainly be more than happy to stay again."
Oct 2015,40,Excellent experience,Highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure. It is situated in a good location just 20 minutes away by Taxi to City Centre and very close to the airport. The Hotel is very well maintained offering all the amenities one can need with an exceptional service.
Oct 2015,50,Stay in Lisbon for ICT Conference,"Super hotel - nice & friendly personnel, super breakfast. Ideally located for the congress centre and Tago area. room with a view from 16th floor was splendid. Friendly and helpful service by all hotel people."
Oct 2015,40,Good location and nice hotel,The hotel is a short walk away from the Sete Rios metro station. Is is near the Zoo but that may be the only attraction in the vicinity. Nothing else of interest in the neighborhood. The rooms were nice and clean and the staff were helpful.
Oct 2015,50,Top marks for Executive Club!,Our second fantastic stay at a Corinthia Hotel.  The Executive Lounge meant we had a special place to relax in and have a drink and snack after a long days sightseeing. The staff team offered exceptional customer service and advice on all aspects of the city. We would always opt for a Corinthia Hotel if there was one available.  We didnt use the spa this time as we had so much to pack in but in future we might plan a slightly longer trip so we can use this to the full.  Brilliant!
Oct 2015,10,Very disappointed from Corinthia Hotel,"We booked this Hotel because of the nice description without knowing that there were lies and hidden Charges... This Hotel is not close to the center, is near the Zoo in the Middle of nothing. It takes 15-20 Minutes by cab to go to the city center! There is a Spa but you have to pay for it, 25 Euros I think for a limited time entrance! If you go to the Pool you have to buy swimm caps to enter the Pool, otherwise they wan't you let in!The staff is unfriendly and you don't feel welcome! definetely not a 5 star Hotel"
Oct 2015,50,"Great stay, special thanks to Daniel!","We had a greta stay here using the Secret Escapes deal to stay in an executive room with access to the executive lounge.Bedrooms were large and very comfortable.Easy check-in at specified executive desk.Very helpful staff throughout the hotel.Very special thanks to Daniel who works in the Executive Lounge who went above and beyond everyday to make our trip a memorable one.Location is good as it is nice and quiet out of town but is just a 2 minute walk from the metro station, definitely worth getting the metro from the airport using a 6euro 24 hour card to save money on taxis!No complaints!"
Oct 2015,40,Lisbon City break,Excellent standard of hotel with great staff who are all fluent in English.Best breakfast we have had in any European city break hotel.Location is out of main Lisbon tourist area but is very close to Metro which is very efficient and cheap  at €6 per day allows Metro/tram/bus travel .Takes just 15 mins and you are in the main centre area of Chiado/Baixia.
Oct 2015,40,9/10,"Quite simply if you get this place for the right price you will not be disappointed. It's spotlessly clean, the staff are great, the rooms and beds are very comfortable and well equipped and it was very quiet. The location couldn't be better for access to the metro/train (1-2 min walk), there are restaurants and cafes within easy walking distance (immediately opposite and near by on the main road) and if you're sightseeing or doing the tourist thing the zoo is on your doorstep. If I had to offer a negative (I'm just being picky) it would be the same negative I have with most hotels. Food, drink and mini bar contents are unnecessarily expensive (but then they always are) so you'd have to be a bit of a mug to eat or drink anything in the room when you can get the same in a nearby shop/cafe for 1/4 the price. Maybe it's just me as people rave about the food. Finally just so you're aware... Swimming caps are mandatory in the pool."
Oct 2015,50,Fantastic!,"We had an excellent stay here - we booked through Secret Escapes & had an amazing deal of 3 nights B&B in an Executive Club Suite (including use of the Executive Club Lounge) for £100 per night.We were on the 21st floor, which gave a wonderful view of the city. The room was enormous  (my husband is a frequent business traveller and he said he'd never seen a room so big) yet very cosy & comfortable. The bathroom was also to a very high standard.The Executive Club Lounge was a wonderful place to chill out after a day's sightseeing and we looked forward each day to the chef's little taster dishes (as well as the bubbly!). There was a wide range of food on the breakfast buffet, as well as dishes available to be cooked-to-order by the chef.All staff in the hotel, from the doorman & porters to the waiting & reception staff were warm, friendly & helpful - but Daniel in the Executive Club Lounge was exceptional.I highly recommend this hotel."
Oct 2015,50,Almost perfect,"A five day stay in the Corinthia Lisbon was very good in almost every way: any complaints are of the minor variety and should not put off potential visitors.The location was good, very close to the Metro and Sete Rios train station (less than 150m from hotel to entrance to both. The Metro is extremely cheap and easy to use, for 6 Euros a 24 hour ticket allows easy access to not just the Metro, but also the trams, funiculars and buses: great value and the best way to get around, in my opinion.Further, a trip to Sintra, 20kms away, is just over £3 return on the nearby train.To the hotel: check in was easy and friendly, with the receptionist noting my wife's forthcoming birthday, more of which later.The room itself, on the fifteenth floor, was spacious, clean and well serviced, and the lifts, contrary to some comments, always arrived very quickly for us.A minor point, though, was the television signal, with the picture breaking up regularly. However, this visit to Lisbon was not arranged so that we could watch television!We had board on a breakfast only basis, and the breakfasts were so good that we were rarely hungry again until late afternoon. On my wife's birthday, two egg tart pastries (pastel de nata) were brought to our breakfast table, much to my wife's surprise. Later, our room doorbell rang, and chocolate cake plus wine arrived: really far beyond any expectations. What a brilliant touch!A comfortable and easily accessible hotel which is maintained to a high standard, while retaining the personal touch."
Oct 2015,50,5-stars hotel with outstanding views,"Very friendly staff with professional behavior.We wished us a room as high up as possible and we got it.We also had wishes regarding my wife's anniversary andthe staff did everything possible to fulfill these.Breakfast on the 24 floor was absolutely wonderful.If we ever more in the future make a visit to Lisbon,we will return to the Corinthia hotel."
Oct 2015,40,I am satisfied with the services the hotel,I will recommend the hotel to friends and acquaintances. I am sorry that due to work I did not have time to exploit the services of your spa and welnews zone.The hotel staff is very friendly and attentive. The food is varied and very tasty.
Oct 2015,50,Corinthia Delights - 5*,"3 nights of enjoyment and comfort was delivered at Corinthia Lisboa. We thoroughly enjoyed the executive lounge benefits as well as a high floor offering fantastic views of the city.The atmosphere, service and pianist in the lounge bar at night was tremendous.    Thanks to Marta who delivered excelent attentive customer service."
Oct 2015,50,Lovely stay,"Position really good, very close to 2 metro stations. Lovely hotel, couldn't fault it really. We were on the 19th floor which was really very quiet and comfortable in every way. Very thick towels with bathrobes and slippers provided. Fast internet connection in room."
Oct 2015,40,Lovely Lisbon,"I have been to Lisbon a few times over the years but I travelled around a lot more this time. Did lots of walking and that really is the best way to see the place. Great weather in early October. Food good, people lovely."
Oct 2015,50,Excellent location and value for money,"Walking distance from train and underground stations, good restaurants / bars nearby and away from noisy Lisboa downtown. If you rent a car , there is plenty of parking spaces nearby after office hours."
Oct 2015,50,Superb Lisbon Hotel,"By Phil 16 October 2015This is undoubtedly one of the best hotels in Lisbon with panoramic views across the city The rooms are comfortable and spacious and the hotel is so handy for the Blue Line Metro station which takes minutes into the centre of Lisbon. The staff are so friendly and helpful and all speak excellent English. The Tempus Bar, Breakfast Room and Restaurant provide top rate food and drink and first rate service.  I do recommend breakfast in the Garden Terrace - an oasis of tranquility in the middle of a bustling city. A fantastic hotel experience and if you see any deals I'd recommend you snap them up."
Oct 2015,50,Fab hotel,This hotel has everything that we wanted.  The staff were brilliant along with the amenities.  If we return to Lisbon we will definitely stay here again.  Nothing was too much trouble for any staff member.
Oct 2015,40,Lisbon,"Overall a nice hotel, a couple of front of house staff seemed unfriendly but majority of staff were very helpful, some noise as room over looking main highway and noise from corridors and other rooms, bar / room service excellent great location near metro and train for sintra great pool and gym facilities"
Oct 2015,40,Adequate hotel,"Adequate. Nice staff. Very good breakfast buffet. Room OK, clean, but details not right: plug not working, lamp shades not straight, clean but very worn towels and sheets. Very warm duvet on the bed, too warm for this time of year"
Oct 2015,40,Good stay in business hotel,"We stayed with 6 ladies at the Corinthia hotel for 4 days. Beautiful hotel in Lisbon. Very comfortable rooms on the 8th floor, cosy beds. The location for business is excellent, for us not so good. Noisy environment next to train and metro station, a lot of traffic. But the metro is at 2 min from the hotel.Dinner at Tipico was great except it was to cold in the restaurant because of the airco. The same at breakfast. The second morning we changed places to the intrance and there was it much better.Breakfast was excellent Friendly and helpful staff.We didn't use the swimming pool because the hours were not so good in the morning.We left at 9 or 10 o 'clock to visit LisbonAlthough I recommend this hotel"
Oct 2015,50,Great Hotel,"The hotel is rated as a five star hotel and it lived up to its rating. I  looked at other reviews and decided to pay for the upgrade to executive suite. The room was on the 22nd floor. It was clean, spacious and very quiet.The executive suite had access to sky lounge where a full buffet breakfast was available every morning. The sky lounge also had drinks and snacks available all day. The staff was exceptionally pleasant and helpful."
Oct 2015,50,Short but Sweet Escape at Corinthia Hotel Lisbon,"I was chosen as a guest of the day, they upgraded my accommodation without added cost. The interior design is lovely with pretty flower arrangement. Staff are friendly and helpful. The room have good space and very clean. I love the sky lounge executive area which is overlooking Lisbon. I enjoyed my stay in Corinthia Hotel Lisbon. Highly recommended."
Oct 2015,50,Great hotel,"Very nice common parts (lobby, restaurant, bar, meeting rooms), excellent food quality, nice service.The rooms are less noticeable, but they 'do the job': clean, comfortable, good TV & wifi.Food (breakfast and buffet lunch) were perfect."
Oct 2015,40,Corinthia is a really nice and sophisticated hotel.,"The room was very comfortable and well equipped. The bed was spacious. Breakfast was delicious and varied. We also enjoyed the pool and sundeck. The outdoor terrace bar surrounded by water has charmed us.We have regretted the absence of a balcony in the room. Access to the pool is free but, as mentioned in other reviews, bathing cap is mandatory and if you did not brought one, you'll pay a high price to get one."
Oct 2015,50,High Quality International Hotel,"This is a large hotel belonging to a chain (based in Malta) of upper end hotels in Europe. It is beautifully fitted out and the rooms tastefully decorated and equipped. The beds are some of the best you will ever sleep on, wonderfully comfortable and with very high class linen. We had an executive room on 21st floor with access to the top floor (24th) executive lounge  which is extremely comfortable and in which they serve a very good quality buffet breakfast. If your flight arrives early in the day in Lisbon, as do flights from N.America, it is definitely worth booking an executive room since you are permitted to wait/rest in the executive lounge until your room is ready in the pm. There are snacks and drinks etc there for you. The view from the lounge is fantastic over the city (as it is from most of the rooms, but gets better the higher up you go). Its location is outside the normal tourist zone, but it is easy to access with a metro station across the street (efficient and very easy to use), many city bus lines nearby. It is also the nearest hotel to the major bus station for long distance buses (especially those of Rede Expresso, Portugal's main bus company with service to all parts of the country). In fact the bus station is in easy walking distance from the hotel, no more than 5 to 10 minutes. The hotel restaurant is expensive, but there are many other options in the area for more reasonably priced fare. The outdoors bar and eating facilities in good weather are very inviting with nicely cultivated gardens."
Oct 2015,40,Great hotel!,"We stayed 2 nights at the Corinthia. It provides 5 star service and has 5 star amenities. The room was very nice and the bed comfortable. The few things with the room I noticed I would say I could see in almost every 5 star hotel I've ever been in, and not worth complaining about. We would choose this hotel again. It is not in the historic center but a short train or cab ride away."
Oct 2015,50,The staff of the Corinthian,"We stayed in the Corinthia 2 nights then a third night on the last day of our 14 days in Portugal. Out of the 8 hotels we stayed at the Corinthia rose to the top.starting with the bell staff the guys on the street with the top hats are first class all the way. The bell captain was so friendly and spoke excellent English.for that matter every employee at the hotel did. I want to give a shout out to Iris the Concierge who booked us a private tour of Setubol, and Sesibra. we spent 9 hours with our driver it was a day trip of a life time! The rooms are fabulous The views spectacular. The guys behind the bar were all top notch as well. The front desk people are on top of it like nobodies business, Like i said the rooms are wonderful but it is the staff that made 3 days of out trip to Portugal just a little nicer."
Oct 2015,50,Great stay in Lisbon.,"Four excellent days and nights at the Corinthia.  Room was very comfortable and the staff everywhere in the hotel were pleasant and exceedingly helpful. The Executive Floor features a great location for relaxing after a busy day, or just chatting with business colleagues over a beer or wine."
Oct 2015,40,Lisbon experience,"Overall stay was very good. It was unfortunate that we were placed along side with a family who has a baby that cried out relentlessly. I have not heard a baby that cries out for a period of more than an hour non stop. Literally non stop, my friend and I were wondering what the parents are actually doing to ease the baby's agony. Told the front desk about the situation and requested if we can get another room but due to lack of availability we got stacked.Hotel is conveniently located near transportation amenities. Train, Metro, and Coach buses are walking distance from the hotel."
Oct 2015,40,Excellent hotel,"I was in Corinthia hotel for a business conference and i will recommend it because of location, great staff, excellent conference facilities, tasty food. The way Corinthia's staff handles your request is outstanding."
Oct 2015,40,Great hotel!!,"We have spent 3 nights in the hotel and it was great!! The room was quiet and clean, the bed was comfortable and the shower was big. The hotel is not in the center but very close to the train and the metro station. Around the hotel you can find a lot of restaurants to eat in nights you preffer not to go to the center and stay near by the hotel."
Oct 2015,40,Business & Leasure,"The hotel is easy to find and at a very good location to go down town or to go the airport. We were well received and we had an excellant time. Wehenever we are in Lisbon, we most probably will book the hotel again."
Oct 2015,50,Fab stay@corinthia,"We had a fantastic time at corinthia with our 3 year old son. The hotel is next to a zoo and with 20% off vouchers from the hotel, our son had a great time at this wonderful zoo. With Bus stops behind the hotel, it was easy to jump on to city tours. The metro and super markets across  was handy! Though Lisbon didnt have too much to offer unlike some other european city centres we have been, the hotel and its amenities made it a worthwhile visit! We enjoyed the oceanarium and fountains across..Watch out for taxis that rip off...The hotel is very near to the airport and should be like a tenner!"
Oct 2015,50,Excellent stay,"Once again the Corinthia brand did not let us down - a lovely hotel, with great facilities. We stopped in an Executive Suite, very roomy with lots of great facilities and a good view of Lisbon. The hotel is just 2 minutes from the tube and train station, so very easy to get into the city centre (10 minutes by tube and very cheap) or further afield by train. The pool was a little cool, but that's about the only thing we can fault. Thanks Corinthia!"
Oct 2015,50,Best breakfast ever!,"This hotel is not the prettiest to look at from the outside.  Inside, however, is an entirely different story.  We had a beautiful room with an amazing view of Lisbon.  We paid extra to eat on the executive floor and had an even better view and the most amazing breakfast spread.  Not a place to visit if you're on a diet.Staff were very friendly and efficient.  We had lost a bag on our flight over, but were given the good news that it had arrived safely when being shown to our table at breakfast.  Great customer service.The hotel is a little way out of the city centre but really close to a metro stop.  Great value.  Nnot"
Oct 2015,50,Comfort and convenience,"The hotel had a very relaxed atmosphere, the gym facilities were excellent and the spa was also of a very high standard. Although not very centrally located we found it a convenient spot to discover Lisbon from."
Oct 2015,50,Lovely hotel friendly staff,this is the third Corinthia hotel I have stayed in and it didn't disappoint. Beautiful hotel with the Corinthia standard of very friendly efficient staff the place runs like clockwork with what appears no effort. It is a little way out of the centre but we found it a welcome oasis after long days sightseeing. It is 2 minutes from the metro and also the train station so it is very easy to get to different areas of the city very quickly and also to Sintra. There are also some little local restaurants to eat in in the evening should you choose to.
Oct 2015,40,Beautiful Hotel,"Great hotel, great staff, super clean and beautifully decorated- very little to fault it on.....if I had to be picky we couldn't see the TV properly from our bed so we had to lay at the end of the bed, pool was freezing cold and the therapy showers didn't work in the spa area although we paid €20 to use those facilities."
Oct 2015,50,Excellent.,I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to stay in Lisbon. We stayed in the executive suite which was comfortable. The staff we're welcoming I would stay at this hotel again if I was to stay in lisbon I had no problems at all.
Oct 2015,50,Thank you & See you again,Perfect hotel for combining long business days with relaxing activities in the evening. Flawless service provided by staff the glimpse in the eye. I would surely recommend any colleague and/or friend to stay at the Lisbon Corinthia.
Oct 2015,50,Matches the Four Seasons in the Heart of Lisbon,"We struggled to find availability at the Four Seasons and other 5 star hotels in the ""desirable"" locations in Lisbon. Lucky for us, Corinthia was able to accommodate our dates for 5 days/6 nights. We couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel. The colours and decor in the hotel are very calming and relaxing. No bright, gaudy patterned hallway carpeting here - a wonderful environment to come back to after the hustle and bustle of a busy city. The staff is super friendly and everyone goes out of their way to make your stay memorable. Room service is very, very efficient and super fast which is generally unheard of in a hotel of this size. We had access to the club level where the food and service was excellent. Breakfast choice was mind boggling in the selection of excellent food; we ate our fill and more which lasted us until dinner most days which is not always good when you have to stop for a coffee and pastise several times during the day. The server in the club lounge, Daniel, remembered exactly what tea I like and would have a steaming pot of mint/chamomile waiting for me while we were dishing our food. Remarkable, considering the number of people in and out of the lounge each day. Our room was huuuuge and the bed, amazingly comfortable. We had a great view of the city, looking out at the aquaduct and suspension bridge. This will be our first choice in hotel if we ever find ourselves in Lisbon in the future and will seek out other Corinthia hotels in Europe during our travels. We loved our stay at this hotel and it made our stay in Lisbon so much more memorable. Highly recommended!!"
Oct 2015,50,Amazing hotel!!!,"This was our first trip away with our baby son (7 months old) and we were anxious.  I contacted the hotel prior to the trip to ask about baby items/equipment. Ana from the hotel was there from start to finish to ensure a smooth transition for our trip, thank you again. The hotel was simply amazing. Lovely room, great outdoor area/bar, fab heated indoor pool and friendly staff that entertained our son. We had access to the executive lounge. The executive lounge is an amazing perk - it meant that we could enjoy a drink and snack whenever the baby napped. Even when baby was awake, we went up there and he was welcomed by staff and given a high chair to sit on. Location wise, you're slightly outside the city centre, but hotel is near a metro stop and its 15 minutes into city centre. All in all, a fab hotel, another home from home."
Oct 2015,40,Good but no better than a 4 star hotel,"I imagine this hotel gets 5 stars because of its conference facilities. It is good but for me this was no better than the many 4 star hotels I stay in around the world. However, breakfast choice and quality is excellent!"
Oct 2015,40,Great Hotel and Staff!,"My wife and I spent five nights in this hotel and were generally very happy with our stay.  From the moment we checked in, the staff was on top of everything.  Every request was promptly handled in a professional manner.  The entire hotel was sparkling clean, which is something we greatly appreciate.  We especially enjoyed the buffet breakfast that served food to meet many different cultural needs and all of the food was excellent.  I think the one item that made our stay so wonderful was the staff.  Each staff member was friendly and willing to go out of their way to make our stay as stress free as possible.  I stay in many hotels throughout each year and the staff at the Corinthia Hotel ranks very high from my perspective.  The patio area in the back of the hotel is very relaxing and weather permitting should be an ideal place to relax.  The only minor problem was the elevator system, which was initially a bit difficult to operate.  We were fine after the first day but new guests had problems that held up everyone for very short periods.  The minor problem with the elevators should not deter a stay at this hotel.  I will surely return the next time I have an opportunity to visit Lisbon."
Oct 2015,50,BEST HOTEL YET,I often wonder what the difference is between a 4.5 and 5 star rating of a Hotel.  This hotel was definitely 5 star and the reason for this was the staff.  The Hotel was fantastic but the staff were outstanding.
Oct 2015,50,Excellent,We definitely loved the Executive lounge on the 24th floor. Breakfast was nice and even better was the possibility to go there for a coffee or a glass of wine in the afternoon/ evening.Location was maybe not optimal but with the metro it just took 10 minutes to get to the city center. I would really like to come here again.
Oct 2015,50,Amazing Hotel,The biggest 5* in Lisbon!! Amazing views of the city and fast and efficient service. Great quality for price. I will be back.I chose this hotel to celebrate a special occasion with my wife and my and her expectations were exceeded. Special Thanks to Goncalo Borges for make that day special.
Oct 2015,40,Best value!,"The service here is 5-star worthy. Restaurant buffet for breakfast and lunch is the only reason I wouldn't rate ""excellent"". Beautifully decorated, friendly staff, this is a great little City Oasis. The SPA is over the top - must visit!"
Oct 2015,50,Excellent hotel,"The Corinthia hotel in Lisbon was very lovely...the décor and amenities were wonderful as well as check-in when offered a nice glass of port wine while waiting. The rooms and bathrooms are all updated and modern. Even though only stayed here for one night, would definitely go back. The location is not the best for walking to a lot of Lisbon (prefer to stay more south closer to Alfama) but you are literally a block from the train station so still convenient."
Oct 2015,50,Fantastic Hotel,"A great hotel to relax in the centre of Lisbon - great staff, great facilities and service is first class. The breakfast is brilliant in the morning - lots of choices. We did have access to the lounge which gives amazing views of Lisbon. Thank you for a great stay and we shall return."
Oct 2015,50,Comfortable and well-presented!,"Our room was lovely, very clean and offered fantastic views!  Breakfast was superb and staff are helpful and organised.  I must say that having stayed in various 5-star hotels and resorts, Corinthia Hotel Lisbon did not fail us. To the management and staff, thank you very much for making our anniversary celebration extra special!  Much appreciated.  - Room 1917"
Oct 2015,50,Super weekend in Lisbon,"My mother and I had a fabulous weekend break in the Corinthia Hotel in Lisbon. The staff were very friendly and helpful, breakfast and lunch were delicious and the bedroom was spacious, clean and very comfortable. The stop for the yellow city tour bus is outside the hotel which is very handy. Its only 15 mins from the airport and 5 mins from the centre of town by taxi. I would recommend the hotel to friends. If I am back in Lisbon I would stay in the Corinthia hotel again. Thank you for a great weekend."
Oct 2015,40,Gorgeous and magnificent hotel!,"We stayed in Corinthia Lisboa for two nights to explore Lisbon and visited Monument to the Discoveries,Torre de Belem, Jeronimos Monastery, Cabo da Roca, Cascais, and National Palace of Sintra.Corinthia Lisboa was a gorgeous and magnificent hotel. Its service was very good and cordial. Room was clean and nice.Breakfast: plenty of choices with a few cook to order items."
Oct 2015,40,Very nice hotel with good service and close to the metro,"The neighborhood is not the most inspiring but there are some good restaurant within working distance. However, the metro is just on the other side of the street getting to downtown Lisbon is very easy. The breakfast was excellent."
Oct 2015,50,Why Stay Anywhere Else!,"We are back for our 5th visit to this hotel. It is a great place to stay while visiting Lisbon. The service is good, the rooms spacious and comfortable and it is very handy for the Metro (Jardim Zoologico stop) which takes you downtown in less than 20 minutes. We like a junior suite which is spacious enough to take a rollaway bed for an adult. Breakfast has an amazing choice and eating in the bar is very reasonable. We are benefitting this time from an upgrade. This allows access to the Sky Lounge where free refreshments are served all day. The hotel is within easy walking distance o the Gulbenkian Museum with its tranquil garden and El Cortes Engles department store. We wouldn't consider staying anywhere else in Lisbon."
Oct 2015,40,Very good!,A very high standard 4 star hotel! Elegant! Clean! Very comfortable bed! Check in a bit slow! Very well situated! Almost in front of the tube station! An amazing fish restaurant in front of the hotel!
Oct 2015,50,Great stay,I like this hotel. Most of the hotel staff are bilingual and speak english and their native portuguese. The room is very nice and the bathroom very spacious. I had a king size bed. There is a gym and a pool with a sun deck on the 2nd floor. You however have to wear a shower cap if you want to go into the pool. I think it costs 1€. I had room service and yes it was 21€ but I got si much food I couldnt eat all of it. There is alot to do and see in the area and well worth the visit. I am facing the back sode of the hotel and you can see a very old aquaduct an the statue of christ in the distance. The staff here are friendly and always willing to help which is lovely. If you arrive late at 12am the main bar will take orders up until 1am. The mojito and red win is great. I would stay again.
Oct 2015,50,The tripadvisor reviews were accurate!,We stayed at the Corinthia for three nights while visiting friends in Lisbon. The hotel is smart and comfortable and the staff all spoke excellent English. They delivered an extremely friendly and effective service at a level that we had never experienced before.
Oct 2015,40,Very nearly All good,"Very easy to get to the hotel from the airport, several options, all very cheap.Check in was quick, easy and friendly. It's a busy hotel so you might have to wait.Room was a good size with a nice view. Clean and comfortable.Desk lamp light wasn't worth having. Very little light.Pillows were really very, very hard. Ask reception and they will change them.Last morning spent in the wonderful gardens at the rear of the hotel. Most of the tourist stuff is a Metro journey which imo wasn't a problem. quick and easy to use.Breakfast was very good at a fair price.The only downside was being seated with a group of business delegates. Very noisy, no consideration for others. It's a large room, so put them in a separate area!"
Oct 2015,50,Expensive but worth it!,"We stayed here three nights. Our stay was excellent, the service was excellent. Hotel has helpful staff and all possible amenities. Spa is awesome. Massage was great. Gym and pool were reasonable.  Good view from the hotel room. Will stay again."
Oct 2015,40,Good exeperience,"Very good hotel, big comfy rooms, good qualtiy breakfast. A bit outside the city center, but just a short taxi ride, or 30 minute walk. Three is also the metro. I can recommend this hotel, but beware of the distance to the center."
Oct 2015,40,Better than expected!,"The hotel was clean and convinent (close to the airport - cost 10 euro by taxi, metro station, and Rede Express bus terminal- the bus goes to Porto). The room was comfortable and clean equipped with WIFI, kettles, and robes/slippers."
Oct 2015,50,FIVE STAR PLUS,"Four night stay, booked through Secret Escapes, package included an executive room and use of the executive lounge. Taxi from airport to hotel reasonable cost 0f 8 euro. On arrival shown to seated executive check in desk, formalities completed in a quick friendly manner. The hotel is modern and gives the initial impression of a quiet, friendly, professional ambiance with customer care by all personnel a priority.Our room was on the 23rd floor with views over the city, all modern conveniences and furnishings expected of a 5 star establishment were provided including free wifi. Housekeeping was very efficient and the room was  always clean and tidy.Breakfast was always taken in the Exec Lounge with its own chef and waiting staff who were always on hand to respond to requests. Complementary drinks and nibbles were available throughout the day and greatly appreciated after a day of sight seeing.The hotel is located near bus stops, metro and train station.Evening dinner was taken in the Tipico Restaurant, with its extensive reasonably priced menu, including many local dishes. The wine list was substantive with a great choice, including locally produced wines. (Our thanks to Paulo the Restaurant Manager) for his vast knowledge of his products and his care and attention to all aspects of the Restaurant. Our waitress was Ana, who delivered a very friendly and professional service; fully knowledgeable about the menu and its content, all meals delivered with a smile and a friendly chat.Although mentioning these two members of staff, all of the staff from front desk, to bar,  housekeeping, and guest services were excellent in their roles and management must be delighted by their standard of service, a most definite asset to the business.Anybody thinking of staying at the Corinthia, will not be disappointed. On our last night which coincided with my wife's birthday she was presented with a birthday cake and a bottle of champagne. Which were consumed and fully appreciated."
Sep 2015,40,Wonderful staff,"Last week we went to Lisbon for a short break and to celebrate my partner's birthday. Despite only mentioning this in passing at the concierge's desk, we were surprised and delighted to arrive back on the night of his birthday to find a beautiful chocolate cake with a bottle of sparkling wine waiting for us in our room!  Needless to say, we were most impressed! My regret is that I didn't take the name of the lovely young woman who looked after this in order to mention her here. Definitely worth staying for the service."
Sep 2015,50,Excellent hotel ideally located between the airport and city center,"Excellent hotel ideally located between the airport and city center.Very good breakfast. Excellent staff and service. Good connections (metro 70 m, taxi in front lobby etc)  Will come again....................................."
Sep 2015,50,Great value for money,Everything about this hotel is good. The rooms are of a good size and well appointed. Very clean. There is a lovely lounge bar downstairs and all the communal areas are very attractive. It is not walking distance to the centre but it is quick and cheap in a taxi so it isn't a problem. The staff were smiling and very helpful. The only annoying thing was their lift system!
Sep 2015,50,Great hotel,"Great, kind and very helpful personality that make you feel really special, nice room and great breakfast with the best view at the entire city. It's easy to get to the city center from here, only 15min by metro. Really good choice for nice and pleasant journey :)"
Sep 2015,50,Amazing views!!,We were upgraded to an Excetutive room which included access to the Club lounge for breakfast and for snacks and drinks throughout the day.This was a very welcome surprise and the views from the top floor across the city are truly breathtaking! The hotel is I dealing positioned to uses the Azul Metro Line into the city and to the River Tagus. Lisbon is a lovely city and we hope to return to see more of it and the surrounding areas.
Sep 2015,50,Wonderful hotel,"Stayed for 4 nights, which was booked through Secret Escapes.  We had the Executive Room option with access to use the Executive Sky Lounge.  Truly wonderful views, service, and food/drink available throughout the day.  Chef on hand at breakfast to cook eggs to your liking, and omelettes.  Had a few issues with the room key card not working so had to get redone.  Was a bit further out from the main centre than we had thought, but with the Metro directly across from the hotel it was not an issue, and it was right on the main line down to the hive of activity.  All staff were very friendly and helpful, and the hotel very clean.  I would definitely stay here again, or at any other Corinthia hotel."
Sep 2015,50,Do upgrade!,"Having bought an upgrade to include access to the Executive Sky lounge, I have to say the value for money was too obvious to miss. I believe the cost of upgrading the room for five nights was around £100.00, which given that the cost of a breakfast is something like 14 €, means you are only losing out on £50.00 just on breakfasts alone. I do not believe the room I received as any better than a normal room, but given that you have access to food and drinks all day, it is definitely worth it! The location of the hotel is not great as you have to use the metro system to get to the City centre, and there is not much around the hotel that is worth seeing (I did not visit the zoo so I cannot have an opinion on that). The hotel staff were very friendly and available, and the rooms and corridors were clean. The meals in the hotel restaurant were relatively expensive (as you would expect) but the food was very tasty and the breakfast buffet was extensive, particularly if you like pastries and cheese’s! When I go back to Lisbon, I am very likely to stay again, although if you intend to spend a lot of time in the city centre I would advise a hotel closer to the action."
Sep 2015,50,Mini Break with Friends,"As soon as you enter the hotel, you know you are in for a treat, the staff are ever so welcoming, helpful and very attentive. The hotel is not far from the subway, which is handy if you like to explore.  The grounds and setting are amazing, perfect if you just want to relax and enjoy the surroundings; it has everything you need, from pool to spa and is immaculate."
Sep 2015,50,Corinthia hotel lisbon,"Great hotel and great location, easily accessible from airport and city center by metro or taxi, breakfast was great also with lots of variety from fresh fruit and meats to cereal,pastries,fresh made waffles and fried bacon,sausage and eggs to order!"
Sep 2015,50,Great stay,We did not know what to expect when we booked the room in Expedia.  We were pleasantly surprised of how nice the hotel was.  It was the most comfortable stay we had during our 10 day trip to Spain and Portugal.  We will definitely come back.  Thanks for the excellent service.
Sep 2015,50,Great Hotel,"A very good hotel, 10 minutes walk to the Metro and 10 minutes ride to the sea. Metro links to the Airport just two stops away. The hotel is clean and the outside bar is a must in the afternoon. The hotel was perfect for my short break."
Sep 2015,50,Fabulous,Staff were very friendly and polite Breakfast was lovely and a large choice Rooms were clean and bed was very comfortable Transport links were great and taxis were reasonable Would definitely recommend
Sep 2015,40,Good Hotel at Sete Rios and Jardim Zoologico area,"Friendly staff and good breakfast. Room was big enough and bed was comfortable. Air could have been more fresh when we came to the room, but luckily there was a window that we kept open to have more fresh air. Hotel is near the Jardim zoologico metro station and we recommend to buy Viva Viagem day card to use metro and trams, because hotel is quite far away from the Lisbon center for walking. Nice restaurants near this hotel was Lekker by MJ and Ground burger."
Sep 2015,50,Very nice hotel,"Our stay at the Corinthia hotel was very nice. The staff was very kind and helpful and were able to answer all our questions. In general the hotel is very clean and the gym and pool are a welcome extra. The only small remark we had was that the tv signal wasn't always very good, also when renting a movie, but I'm sure they will be able to fix this. The hotel may be a bit further away from the city center, but there is a subway station nearby which makes it very easy to travel where you want to go. The Lisbon Zoo is within walking distance and is definitely recommended."
Sep 2015,20,Decent hotel but terrible service,"When I went to check in I was told the room type I requested was not available, but if I returned in 2-3 hours they would have it.  So I rearranged my plans for the day, went out and returned about 3-4 hours later.  When I went to check in again and get my room key I was told that there were no rooms with double beds and there was twin beds available.  They were quite rude and not at all accommodating or sympathetic.  They refused to acknowledge their earlier statement that it would be available and basically told me there was no choice in rooms but that there may be one the next day. Otherwise the hotel is fine- nothing special but no major complaints.  The location is a bit far from most of the action but at least its right near a metro stop."
Sep 2015,50,Best Hotel for Hospitality.,"As you can see we have stayed here a few times this year, again we have had the most excellent stay.  Service as always is superior to any hotel we have stayed in the world. The Corinthia Hotel brand prides itself on service and excellence and deliveres in both. Rueben, General Manager has bought his customer satisfaction skills to the forefront and his team are a credit to this hotel.  The Corninthia Hotel is the best of both worlds. Perfect for business - has a large conference suite and meeting rooms along with fully equipped business centre in the Executive Lounge.  Free wifi throughout the hotel, free newspaper of your choice and ample work space in executive rooms. Also, great for leisure guests too.  Just outside the main centre, so quiet retreat after a busy day sightseeing. Next to metro station and mainline station for trains to Sintra and beyond and metro into town takes 6 minutes. They have a choice of eateries, Tempo Lounge serves an excellent variety of snacks of full meals and all very tasty. Tipico Restauarant serves a full menu along with a buffet style choice. Always busy and food is excellent. We have also used room service and again, cannot fault. Breakfast is a real treat - we used the Executive Lounge, where you can get everything you want from Fruits. Cereals, eggs (cooked to your liking) bacon and breads galore. Alternatively they have their main breakfast restaurant Sete Collinas. We haven't used here but they served all the above plus extras and if the weather is good (which compared to Britain it always is) you can enjoy breakfast al fresco.  The staff are sublime. Always happy, always ready to help and very knowledgable. Sandra who manages the Exec Lounge & Guest Services has a great team and should be proud of them all. Daniel who works tirelessly in the lounge serving everything with a smile and has (eyes in the back of his head) and is ready with what you want before you ask..true professional. Valter (Chef in Lounge) perfect eggs - thank you. Both the doorman Roque and Domingos are great fun. Full of stories and advice on Lisbon and surrounding areas. Roque has recommended a shopping area for our next visit so my husband is dreading that!!  We like to hear about their fishing trips. Al in all a perfect retreat. Spa is great and even if you just take a dip in the pool it's so relaxing. Bring a swimming cap or you can buy one for €5 and reuse next time - because once you have experienced this hotel and service you will be back. Can't praise highly - perfect service.  Friendly professional staff. Clean airy and spacious rooms. Housekeeping beyond perfection.  Safe and secure lifts. Great green credentials and even won awards for it at the World Travel Awards. Try this place and prove me wrong - you'll love it."
Sep 2015,40,Great hotel but a little far from city center,"The Corinthia Hotel is a nice hotel but a little far from all of the sites in Lisbon. If you are planning to walk from the hotel, it'll take you about 45 min to an hour to get to all the action.  The metro and train station are really close by so those the best options for getting around."
Sep 2015,40,Excellent stay in Lisbon,"We stayed 4 nights. Five persons - 2 adults, 1 child and 2 seniors.Even though the hotel was fully booked we never experienced any crowding, queuing or inconvenience.The hotel standard was great - so was service, pool and meals.Can warmly recommend this hotel - the only thing is its location a bit out of the centre - but easy access to close by metro station."
Sep 2015,50,Great stay,"Hotel Corinthia was a perfect choice for our week in Lisbon. Staff were very helpful ,rooms good and breakfast choice was excellent. Ask for a room on the higher levels and at the back and you will get a beautiful view of the aqueduct. Although the hotel seems to be out of town it's only a 2 min walk to the metro which takes you right to the heart of Lisbon so perfectly placed for everything"
Sep 2015,50,A lovely week in Lisbon,"The hotel was excellent, except for the usual gripe about quality of lighting. Never bright enough. And not enough electric sockets. The hotel was in a good location for the metro, which is a good way to get around to visit places of interest."
Sep 2015,50,Recommended,Everything was perfect. Helpful staff. Clean rooms that sometimes is cleaned 2 or 3 times a day. Near to train and metro stations. Taxi stop in front of the hotel. Good restaurants around. I recommend the executive lounge access as u will have the breakfast there in the morning and then open snacks and drinks the whole day up to 10 pm.
Sep 2015,40,Nice hotel and very good junior suite,"Good hotel located quite close from the train station in Sete Rios and close from Praca de Espanha. The facilities are good and despite the fact the whole hotel is nicely decorated is a bit old style and if it would have a renovation it would be much better perceived. However it does not have any impact on the comfort and cleanliness. It features meeting rooms, an outdoor garden, an indoor swimming pool with a nice terrace deck outside and  a SPA. The staff was very friendly and helpful.I got a junior suite and I can say the room was quite spacious and again nicely decorated but again a renovation would play miracles, especially in the bathroom. Featured a flat TV, a safe box big enough to fit a big laptop and mini bar.Breakfast is also very good with a good variety of choices and quality products. Internet is available and free of charge and the price was fair."
Sep 2015,50,Lovely friendly hotel and handy for the metro,The only thing I would change would be in the room......I would've preferred a mirror over the dressing table / desk and a plug socket as when using hairdryer or straighteners I had to stand up near the full length mirror or trail the lead into the bathroom......also could do with a socket for mobile phone both sides of the bed not just one......room 814
Sep 2015,40,Overall experience,Overall our stay was excellent for the value.  Would recommend this hotel.   Only one bad experience   A women in guest services was curt n not pleasant.  I don't know her name.  She was not helpful at all.  Other than that great
Sep 2015,50,Fantastic hotel,This hotel is a amazing. Great service from the minut you arrive and till you leave the hotel. The hotel is not situatated in the center of Lissabon but the metro is just besides the hotel and you will be in the center within 10 min.Everything was perfect and we will come back.
Sep 2015,50,Wonderful Hotel !!,My wife and I have visited 3 times now and each time it is amazing - from arrival to departure everything is flawless and the staff are amazing.  Thank you specifically to Vera the front office manager who made our anniversary so special and Miguel in the dining room who was always so friendly and helpful at breakfast.
Sep 2015,40,Great  vacation,"Wonderful  design, with  big  attention  for    details    in hall   and  in room/at  least  in  our/ like  fresh flowers,/in  our  room  orchidee/ modern vases   and  bowl ,  pictures  ,kindles ,very  comfortable  place  in  table    for charge the  mobile phones, tablets, laptop ,  variety  of music for healing, information on tv/video  screen,tea and coffee maker  , super   comfortable    bed , and  a lot of   another   things very warm and  helpfull staff,  great  atmosphere -in point of  fact  really great  stay Halina &Yacov"
Sep 2015,50,Superb Service,My wife and I have stayed at this hotel on four separate occasions during 2015 and have found all aspects to be of the highest quality. Location is outside the city centre but within a five minute walk is a metro - direct to the centre in ten minutes and a rail station which has a direct line too Sintra. In conclusion a five star hotel that delivers especially customer service at incredible value.
Sep 2015,40,"Excellent service, slightly aged furnishings","Really enjoyed the stay here. Located in proximity to a major transport hub but a long walk from the old town. Stayed for business, so I didn't experience a lot of the facilities, but breakfast was excellent (though pricey for Lisbon). The bed was great but the other furnishings, particularly the desk, were showing their age. Not something major though. I would stay here again for sure."
Sep 2015,40,Perfect with room for improvement,Everything was in fact working well from a hotel point of view- only problem is a somewhat noisy location due to proximity to highway and air trafic right above your head. Friendly and professional staff.
Sep 2015,40,Great Location- Spacious!,The hotel is beautiful decorated with elegant furniture.  The rooms were nice too and had everything you would need for a few days stay.  The breakfast and room service food was some of the best I've had.
Sep 2015,50,warm and friendly hospitality,"From the moment we walked into the Corinthia Hotel in Lisbon, we felt well taken care of. We really appreciated all the little touches - the personalized message on our video screen, the explanation of the amenities by the bellhop, and all the very helpful multi-lingual staff in the Executive Lounge (many of them present on our multiple visits to the Lounge. When do they find time to sleep?!). Everything was very welcoming and of the highest quality.I am admittedly not the most sophisticated of travelers, but the Corinthia in Lisbon helped make my first big international trip a wonderful experience.My one complaint is that there was no option on the (huge) television screen to project from my own device (i.e. a cast screen, or HDMI option). We would have greatly appreciated the possibility of viewing our own media while in our hotel room unwinding after a busy day."
Sep 2015,50,Very nice hotel ,"Very nice hotel close to the airport of Lisbon. If you want to go downtown, you can easily take bus or metro which both stop in front. Taxi to the centre is not expensive 5 to 6 euros. The hotel offers a nice swimming pool, terrace area, great breakfast and it's close to the zoo. The only small negative is that you are obliged to wear a swimming cap... Also our child of 1, which wasn't easy."
Sep 2015,30,Hotel showing its age,I stayed here in 2010 and had a great experience and so I picked it again on our current trip with another couple. The hotel still looks the same in the lobby but the rooms that we were assigned on the seventh floor was old with stained carpet and a lingering foul odour in the bathroom. The service was also just average. We had to display the Do Not Disturb sign because the housekeeping staff was knocking on our door at 8:30 am to try and clean the room two days in a row. We also had afternoon tea in the hotel and have to say the service was less than friendly.
Sep 2015,40,Weekend,"Everything was great except the uncomfortable pillows  and the lack ofelectrical plugs to charge the mobile phone,  lap top,  etc. Great service,  good location,  definitely good enough to be recommended ."
Sep 2015,50,Lovely hotel lovely spacious rooms easy access to main areas,"We really enjoyed our stay at Corinthia. The rooms were spacious and had everything we needed. We could easily request other things such as the iron, toothbrush. The staff were responsive and helpful."
Sep 2015,50,A very enjoyable location for a business meeting!,The staff were very helpful and accommodating throughout the stay and business meeting.  I had some of the best food through Room Service than I've ever had.  Compliments to the Chef for the Lemon/Garlic Risotto and Shrimp.
Sep 2015,50,"Excelent hotel, perfect location","Very nice hotel, excelent food, good service. We had executive room with breakfast at top floor. Perfect lounge possibility before/after dinner. Pool was a little small. Near metro/ walking distance to centre."
Sep 2015,50,TOP RATE HOTEL,"Well positioned hotel in commercial district of Lisbon. Close to the Metro and with plenty of taxis available right outside the hotel.The hotel is immaculately clean and all staff -  especially guest services and reception were excellent.Breakfast buffet was fantastic with a vast selection and the waitresses absolutely perfect.The only downside to the hotel is the price of soft drinks in the outside garden terrace.I would ask why a 200cl of Coca Cola Zero is the same price as a 250cl of Seven Up. Same price for both but 25% less quantity of Cola against Seven up.Local price of 330cl of soft drink in an outside cafe was 50% cheaper. But if this is my only grievance then it is a small one.I can definitely,and will,recommend the Corinthia to anybody who is intending to travel to Lisbon."
Sep 2015,50,Great Experience,Second stay for us.  Extremely comfortable and the overall experience was fantastic.  Breakfast was very good with a very big choice.  Very easy to get into Lisbon from this hotel.  Will certainly return again
Sep 2015,50,Never disappoints,"This was our third time staying at the Corinthia and I am pleased to say it never disappoints. The rooms are comfortable, the staff courteous and the amenities are excellent. If booked well in advance it is very affordable and there are excellent transport links with Sete Rios station nearby. Will be back next year!"
Sep 2015,50,Great hotel,Superb service. Great food. The buffet breakfast dinner are both superb 5 stars at reasonable price. The staff truly friendly. And extremely pleasant to families with children. Physically attractive hotel and nice spa /swimming pool. The location is near zoo which is a great day trip. The subway station is a short walk providing easy access to historic center and also Sintra which is a town not to be missed. No negatives except minus hot tub by swimming pool.
Sep 2015,40,"Really nice hotel,v but a couple of downsides","Three couples stayed in three Junior Suites on the 18th floor for three nights, and it was thoroughly enjoyable. One of the rooms wasn't ready even in later afternoon and this was annoying as we had asked for early check in. Also couldn't book us a 6 berth taxi to go out at night. Had to take two threes as a compromise. Could be perfect but for these niggles."
Sep 2015,50,Luxury and comfort,"We stayed for 5 nights and had a wonderful experience. After a busy and full day around the city it was great to come back to such a luxurious, friendly and accommodating place. We didn't want the holiday to end!"
Sep 2015,50,5-days break in Lisboa,"The hotel is located in the middle beetwen airport and city centre,close to zoological garden and metro-(and railway-)station opposite the street.Within 6 stops (5 min.)you are in Bairro Alto.It is also close to Benfica football stadion. 3 stops inthe other direction (Collegio Militar/Luz)you have a hugh supermarket ""EL CORTE INGLEZ"".Bedsare superb,quite room (floor 17),exellent breakfast and also good restaurant.Almost all personal are speaking good english and give very good service"
Sep 2015,50,Excellent Hotel with great Service,First time at Corinthia. Pleasantly surprised with the quality . Would definetly recommend the hotel. The rooms are spacious and clean. Bed and pillows are great for a good night sleep. Breakfast good standard. The staff are very professional and helpful. Always with a smile on their face.
Sep 2015,40,Very comfortable and stylish hotel,"A very stylish hotel in a lovely City.  The location may seem a little way out of the main drag but taxis are very accessible, frain and metro literally across the road.      After a busy day shopping and sightseeing, the Corinthia is a welcoming sight."
Sep 2015,40,four day break,visit highlighted by excellent friendly and helpful staff.....first class hotel with excellent facilities and good food. Our visit was slightly spoilt by two 'noise incidents' caused by ??? redecorating in neighbouring bedrooms.Close to Metro station which offers frequent and reliable service
Sep 2015,50,Great Lisbon Hotel,"The wife and I have just returned from a five night stay.The hotel itself is superb,the staff are the friendliest I have ever encountered.Our room was lovely,clean,large bed,great view over the city etc.The pool and spa area were fantastic,very welcome after a hard day site seeing.The breakfast was all and more than you could ever ask for and is a great start to the day.We ate in the  Tipico restaurant a couple of times,we went for the buffet option which allows you to choose from lots of lovely food.Although the metro station is literally over the road we chose to take taxis into town which was only €7 or 8  we even got talking to one taxi driver ( I speak Portuguese ) who took us on a four hour tour around Lisboa,he knew everything and took us around Jeronimus,Belem,the Cathedral and much more.Much better than the tour buses which just wiz you round.Will definitely be coming back to the Corinthia,highly recommended."
Sep 2015,50,EXCELLENT STAY,"Excellent hotel, the service was 1st class, the staff were very attentive and polite, rooms clean, facilities in the executive lounge were a bounus, infact all areas of this hotel are Excellent. Many thanks Corinthia."
Sep 2015,40,Excellent Hotel,Hotel Corinthia is a top quality hotel with all staff speaking English and modern facilities.It is also well positioned for access to sights and metro. I recommend it for business and pleasure visits.
Sep 2015,30,DECEIVING,"We paid for upgrade to junior suite, I expected to have 24 floor facilities but is seems need executive suite for this. So expensive just for larger room. Also in compensation for the 3 days maintenece noise."
Sep 2015,40,Nice CONFERENCE Hotel,"My husband and I had a lovely experience at the Corinthia Hotel. The hotel was extremely close to the metro line (1 block) which made it very convenient to come and go (only 6-7 stops from downtown on the blue line, ~15min ride). The hotel staff was courteous and professional.  My only criticism (and this is our fault for not realizing it) is that the hotel is really meant for conference goers.  During our week stay, there were 3 different conference going on so the elevators were extremely crowded in the mornings.  Additionally, the surrounding area had little-nothing to do and the nearby restaurants were more expensive for the quality of food that you received.  There is a bakery nearby and their pastel de nata were awesome & cost 1 euro!"
Sep 2015,40,A good place to stay in Lisbon,"When my wife and I first arrived at this hotel we were a little disappointed as our room was not a clean as it should have been, however I have to say the hotel really stepped up.  Once we complained and they saw our room they were most apologetic and upgraded us to a lovely clean room.  The remainder of our stay was most pleasant and I could not fault the service.  The hotel is 10 years old and a little tired now and in need of a face lift, however the staff as wonderful and more than make up for it."
Sep 2015,50,First class,"Ah a modern hotel that has kept old school European service. On this trip we stayed many places but this was our favorite.  The hotel is clean, the rooms are clean. Every thing in the room is modern and functional. The staff a really polite and knowledgeable and the concierge is a real gem, gold keys on lapels and all. Our bed was turned down and a mat placed at our bed side, chocolates on the pillows, fabulous. Hurry and stay here, there are not many hotels that take service seriously anymore as the world becomes downgraded to aloft and Holiday Inn standards."
Sep 2015,50,City break in Lisbon,"Exceptional hotel with friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend. Well located with first class facilities. Executive room well worth the additional cost as it includes access to the executive lounge. Good restaurant."
Sep 2015,40,Stayed here after a cruise,"Our first impression of this hotel was one of mass confusion.  We were very early having just gotten off a cruise ship.  There were groups checking in and groups checking out, and tempers were getting frayed.  The staff was obviously over whelmed at the amount of people and their luggage.  It took over an hour to get our luggage secured so that we could go do something else until we could check in.  When we came back, the lobby was much less congested, but the rooms still were not ready, so we tried to have lunch on the terrace.  Again, the service was terrible, and the food not worth the wait.   That being said, when we were able to check in, everything went smoothly.  The rooms were nice, and the staff much more agreeable.  The breakfast the next day was in a word, Awesome.  The best waffles I've ever eaten ,  Everything was good but those waffles !!!!! The hotel is in a convenient location for the hop on/off buses and for taxi's   Only problem, not enough time in this beautiful city !!!"
Sep 2015,50,Another Good Experience,"Recent 4 day stay in this hotel. Some years since previous stay but just as good as before.   Staff in particular were excellent - friendly and always helpful.  We found the executive lounge facility to be very nice for relaxation. Buffet breakfast there was always good with excellent service from helpful waiting staff.  No real complaints but some niggles about the aircon in the bedroom which was occasionally pernickety to adjust to our requirements.  Also, the range of English language TV channels was poor - no BBC World News, CNBC, Bloomberg.  Nice to have a Nespresso machine in the bedroom though. Overall we were very happy with our stay and hope to return."
Sep 2015,50,very good hotel,"Excellent breakfast buffet , Nice and clean Rooms  , very good service, only about  5,to 8 euro in cab to lissabon rossio  midtown. Good service, Close to airport,  Close to benfica, and sporing lissabon  football stadium"
Sep 2015,40,Top business district hotel. ,"Lovely hotel on the outskirts of town. Our junior suite way spacious and comfortable but with no views. Towels and lining were changed daily and the turn down service every evening was a lovely bonus. Breakfast had a good selection of hot and cold food, the bar area was relaxing and comfortable... Don't get caught out by the 'Hendricks gin & tonic' @ €18 a shot! Spa is charged extra at €20 per person for 2 hours, but well worth a visit. The metro is mins walk away but a quick trip in to town! Definitely recommend this hotel, perfect location with friendly helpful staff!"
Sep 2015,50,Would love to go back.,"Very attentive staff who were both friendly and helpful.  Close to airport - about 15 min taxi journey. Ate in the buffet restaurant - delicious food, even for a vegetarian which I found difficult in portugal! Wish I didn't have to leave."
Sep 2015,50,Weekend away !!!,Very happy with this hotel and with stuff which were very helpful to assist you with any request. Hotel is located very short trip with metro and 5/10 min walk from shopping mall. Definitely would recommend !!! :)
Sep 2015,40,Lovely hotel,"We stayed 4 nights at this lovely hotel. Although a little bit out of the main part of Lisbon, it was a 2 min walk to the metro and a 15 min ride in, so very easy to get around. We stayed in a junior suite which was tastefully decorated and large. Breakfast was great. Only problem we had was with house keeping/guest services not understanding requests for extra duvets/fresh milk and it taking several attempts to get it right"
Sep 2015,50,Immaculate,Beautiful hotel with helpful and friendly staff. Cannot wait to return. So relaxing and comfortable. Metro very close by. Tasty breakfast with plenty of variety. Room was so clean with great views of the city.
Sep 2015,50,Fantastic,"Our second visit and it won't be the last, love the hotel and the staff are 110% fantastic and so friendly, just love it!! Already looking at dates for next year.Must be one of the best hotels we have stayed in and will go back.Highly recommended. Sky lounge is superb."
Sep 2015,30,Average hotel,"Location: Yes, not in the city center. 10 minute drive from the airport. 5 Minute walk to the subway or train station. 7 minute subway ride to the city center. Numerous cafe's and restaurants in the area. If you are a walker, the city center is about a 60 minute walk, through beautiful neighborhoods. Personally, I thought the location was great. Hotel: Room as average and comfortable, but needed dusting. The hotel itself is nice, the patio at the back was definitely above average. The gym was one of the best I have seen in a hotel.   Wifi was stable and very fast.Food: Didn't use room service or the restaurant, but had the breakfast buffet included in our stay. My advice, if breakfast isn't included, DO NOT pay the 20 euro's for it, go to a nearby café. Very disappointed in the food. The selection of breads, fruit and pastries were fine, but anything that required cooking was a failure. Roasted potatoes, also known as hashbrowns, were obviously shipped in and just defrosted. The scrambled eggs, were so undercooked and runny they would require a spoon to eat. Rarely saw anyone eating them, and honestly, they turned my stomach. Anything that needed to be cooked or heated was either undercooked or warm. Definitely the worst breakfast buffet I have ever had in a hotel.Staff: If you read my previous reviews on hotels, I give positive reviews. I'm very low maintenance and don't have the need to deal with hotel staff unless something comes up. On this trip I had to deal with the staff twice, once to check in, the other requiring assistance on an urgent overseas call. Total failure on both interactions. Now I am sure that the everyday dealing with the staff is a pleasant experience, but on both these occasions I was experiencing some stress and found them not to be helpful at all. Not something I would expect from a hotel of this caliber. As this was my first time in Portugal, I compared this hotel from other 5 star hotels I have stayed in around the world."
Sep 2015,50,exceptional yet again,"This is our 4th time at Corinthia Lisbon and yet again they exceed expectation.  The Hotel is beautiful and so luxurious.  The staff are so welcoming, every single member of staff are so accommodating.  You truly are treated with the highest of regard.  We booked the executive room and you are checked in privately and given a nice glass of Portugese wine. We like the executive rooms as rooms are on the  higher floors and the views are magnificent.  The executive rooms allow you to have breakfast downstairs where there is an abundance of delicious food.  there are live cooking stations also.  The choice is amazing.  You can also have breakfast on the 24th floor where its a little quieter.  Again the food is wonderful and you are truly looked after by Daniel who never stops! Daniel is meticulous in every way, Valter the wonderful chef is so attentive he made our delicious fluffy hot omelettes delish!!  Valter made a  pancake one morning with the full Liverpool football crest - my husband was amazed at Valter's art work -Again Valter was so informative - Valter provided lots of useful information about the area and various transport to use which was very useful.  The manager must be so proud of Daniel and Valter they are indeed an asset to Corinthia.  We went to Sintra which is absolutely beautiful you must visit when in Lisbon.  We also went to Fatima which was a long awaited trip I wanted to do.  Again its beautiful and very moving.  A little tip for Fatima don't go via the local trips as they charge around 90-100 euros for two people either half day trip or full day.  sadly its just transport there and back as you don't pay to get into Fatima.  We went over to the coach station (Sete Rios) opposite the zoo - we booked the coach which was only around 44 euros for both of us return.  the coach was very modern and comfortable with air con.  The journey was about 80 minutes but went very quickly as you can take in all the views.  the coach stops right outside Fatima and there are various shops and cafes in the area so it made for an enjoyable day.  I forgot to mention that when we arrived we got a room upgrade which was wonderful and on my husbands birthday we came back to a beautiful chocolate cake and a bottle of champagne, how extremely kind of the hotel.  All I can say is thank you once again for a very memorable stay and wonderful hospitality.  We will of course be back and hope to visit Corinthia Malta is spring."
Sep 2015,40,Business Conference,"Overall, a very pleasant experience! would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and colleagues. The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful which added to my enjoyment of the stay. A very pleasant stay in Lisbon!!"
Sep 2015,20,Could be so much more,"Here for a conference. Very disappointed in the service speed all around, particularly in the terrace lounge. Food was pretty much the same each day and nobody that worked on site seemed to smile. Finally, being told to go and buy my own coffee during the conference because they wouldn't turn on the machines for an eag breakout as a bit awkward, especially since the company had booked the week for 300 people. Prob not going to be coming back here anytime soon."
Sep 2015,40,I recommend ...nice hotel,Located 10 minutes walk to Lisbon zoo...corinthia hotel enjoys a dynastically well delicately balanced marbled foyer...a wonderful bar settings...a unique kind of breakfast...a second floor gym and a medium size clean swimming pool...neat rooms clean bathrooms with music..15 minutes by metro to city center...free wifi available around the clock...there are those amongst the staff who are rigid..and harsh..it's always not the issue...but the way you address it that makes a difference...May be protocol ...food for thought..
Sep 2015,50,Real Excellent hotel Thank you Corinthia Lisbon hotel,"Good location away from noise yet 4 min from the metro/train station. Beautiful hotel, spacious rooms and nice big bath. High quality service all the service providers nice and extremely polite. A very good restaurant right across the street in addition to the one in the hotel. less than 10 min by metro and you are in the center. Loved it I would definitely come back again. Thank you Lisbon Corinthia hotel for the lovely stay."
Sep 2015,50,Nice hotel very well run,Postive experience in every way clean and well managed only negative would have preferred with a short visit to be more toward central location. Lisbon is very scenic with lots of fun activities to choose
Sep 2015,50,One day stop over,"Excellent hotel, with excellent views over Lisbon. Supremely clean hotel, very modern and it represents great value for money. Would definitely recommend if doing a stop over as it is very handy for the airport taxi rank just outside."
Sep 2015,50,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel, we stayed 7 days, three guests in a Junior Suite and had plenty of room. Rooms are large and we had a very good experience. It is well connected to downtown through metro and taxi wich are both cheap. Breakfast is good and plentyfull, I just missed plain unsweetened yoghurt."
Sep 2015,50,Best hotel ever!,"Our stay was exceptional. Best hotel experience we've ever had. Staff are just wonderful and the hotel is run to perfection. Service, rooms, Executive Lounge are all first class. Would definitely return to the Corinthian."
Sep 2015,40,Very nice hotel,"Very nice but not perfect. We had a junior suite which is basically a larger room which was very nice. Sofas to sit on. Coffee table etc. View is average. Just a lot of high rise buildings. But the reason this hotel is so nice is the staff and them making you feel comfortable and will do anything to help you. Also the fact there is a swimming pool, gym and spa. The spa is an extra cost but the pool and gym are free to guests. The outside terrace is really nice. After coming back from an evening out we were able to chill on the terrace with a drink. Very relaxing. The restaurant for an evening meal is amazing! It's a buffet style but please don't let that put you off! So much choice of sushi, salads, fish and meet which the chefs will cook for you there and then.  The hotel is a 2 minute walk to the metro and train station. Very easy to get around and it takes about 15 minutes by metro to Lisbon centre which really is ok. Also the taxis are very cheap!We got the train to Sinatra one day and then cascais the next. Easy. I highly recommend doing a Segway tour of Lisbon central as it is a very hilly city and the segways are so fun and very easy to use. Beats walking up all those steep hills!!Anyway, I would definitely recommend this hotel is you don't mind a metro journey into the city. Really lovely staff and reasonable prices."
Sep 2015,40,Comfortable hotel for business traveller,"The Corinthia is a reasonably priced, comfortable hotel on the outskirts of Lisbon. Definitely geared twoards the business traveller.  Situated in a very quiet but well serviced by public transport.  Highlight of visit was the courteous staff and the pianist and drummer who were awesome.  In hindsight I would have gone for a more centrally located hotel."
Sep 2015,50,A real 5 Star!,Very nice hotel. Indoor poor (would have liked indoor/outdoor). BEAUTIFUL hotel terrace outside with huge TV for sports viewing. Drinks expensive. VERY close to the subway. Would stay again. No problems.
Sep 2015,50,Stay for one night,We were very impressed with the hotel service and rooms.  We called to have our suitcases weighed the night before and the person who came up was very friendly.  We would definitely come back again.  However having to wear bathing caps for the pool was a bit of a pain
Sep 2015,30,Mixed feelings,"We are currently staying at the Corinthia and although the hotel is very pleasant, for tourists, it's a fair distance from the city centre.The tube is easily accessed from 300m away, but it is a 10-15 minute ride in and a bit of a faff.One thing I would comment on, especially if I were here on business is the Executive Lounge.  We paid extra for this to be able to have a relaxing breakfast and evening drinks away from the crowds. So we're a very disappointed that babies/children are allowed in and worse, parents aren't encouraged to keep them under control.If I was here on business I would be less than pleased to be trying to work with screaming kids and toddlers running around the lounge."
Sep 2015,50,MIDDLE AGE TRAVELLERS FROM CANADA,"This HOTEL and staff ""ARE AMAZING"". Accommodations, location to metro (subway), train,bus was great. Hotel was very clean and the best during our two week visit to Spain and Portugal....OH YES...the bed was very comfortable and wanted to bring it home."
Sep 2015,50,Excellent Hotel...I will be back,"Great hotel hotel, exceeded my expectations.Great location and hotel facilities...the only downside is the TV package in the room, apart from on-demand TV there is no free movie/series entertainment channels (FOX, AXN, etc) and no sport channels."
Sep 2015,50,perfect stay in a cosy hotel,"i really liket the hotel. It ha severything you can expect, from a perfect room to a very good breakfast and also the gym and pool are very good. not to forget the view and service in the sky lounge. ans with the underground next to the door, you ar ein 15 minutes every where in the city"
Sep 2015,50,Lovely stay,"Despite being a big hotel that corinthia maintains a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. I felt very looked after, all the staff were wonderful and attentive without being overbearing. Only a short walk from the metro and mainline train service too. We had a great time"
Sep 2015,40,Holiday - City trip in Lisbon,"Very high standing hotel located in the business area of Lisbon.The staff is very friendly and always there to help.The rooms are very nice and even if the hotel is located in a busy area, you do not hear any noise during the night.The underground 150 meters far from the hotel makes it very easy to go from one to the other side of Lisbon.Only negative point: the prices of the drinks in the hotel which are very expensive compared to the small cafeterias across the street (double of the price).But all in all, very nice stay!"
Sep 2015,50,Best. Bed. Ever.,"I stayed here with my fiance while he was in town for a conference.  It is a beautiful hotel, staff were very nice.  Breakfast was one of the best I've had, every day.  The best, and for me one of the most important things, was the amazingly comfortable bed.  It is just as nice as my own.  Understand, when I read hotel reviews, I am always looking for someone to review the bed.  If I'm torn between 2 hotels and in one of the reviews someone says the bed is great, that is the decider!  The only thing I was not impressed with was the concierge.  I tend to rely on myself, but for the first time I was staying in a hotel providing this service and I really wanted a great Fado experience.  I had done a bit of research on the subject, but wanted a local's input.  I checked the reviews for the place suggested..... then canceled the reservation and went with my instincts.  It was here that I learned that a concierge doesn't know everything and I can trust myself and my 'mad TripAdvisor skills'."
Sep 2015,50,Lisbon corinthia,Excellent stay great location for underground etc shopping excellent only two stops to Columbia and four to avenida value for money excellent got underground ticket for three days did yellow bus tour just outside hotel excellent
Sep 2015,40,9,"Very good hotel, room was beautifull with beauiful  view, breakfast was delicious, everything was very good.most members are kindly en correct.the location en accomodation was very good, we went by metro to the city"
Sep 2015,30,Nice hotel but...,Great stay in terms of comfort and value but lack of service at breakfast. Perhaps too busy? Not a hotel for a single traveller.Air conditioning doesn't seem to be working but I'm fine with the temperature generally. Can't imagine middle of summer!
Sep 2015,40,A four night stay in a wonderful hotel,"My Wife and I just returned on 9/2/15 from a four night stay. the hotel room was above average. The hotel is clean, the room well thought out and king bed suite was excellent. The Terrace Cafe outside was extraordinary. This trip was to visit family so we were unable to use all of the hotels facilities. The room service was excellent. The food preparation and presentation both at the Terrace and in room service were at least four star. The service of the hotel staff was incredible. From the front desk to Concierge everyone was incredibly polite and helpful. Biggest kudos go the the terrace staff led by Fabio, a young man bound for success in the hotel industry who couldn't have been more charming and accomodating to my Wife, myself and guests who we entertained. Finally great thanks to Teresa also of the terrace staff who apparently has been promoted to Hostess at the Tipico restaurant on property. She was incredibly attentive and helpful to us.      David and Lucia"
Sep 2015,50,Stunning hotel,"This hotel is brilliant. It depends on what you are looking for but if service is important then this is the place to be. It's perfect if you are thinking of going to the zoo or using the metro. Its not within walking distance of central Lisbon but in terms of value, amenities and looking after you be it individual, couple or family the hotel is perfect. I can't praise the staff enough and highly recommend the executive lounge with all that brings. I for one would love to go to this hotel again......classy to say the least."
Sep 2015,50,Luxury stay in a beautiful city,"We stayed for four nights for our 3rd Wedding Anniversary in August 2015. The hotel is very modern, luxurious and welcoming. We chose an executive room as we had already stayed in one previously in Corinthia Budapest. The Executive lounge in Lisbon lived up to all of our expectations and our room had a beautiful view of the city. The only issue we had was that the room had a very strong smell of smoke, despite us leaving the window open all of the time. As non-smokers, this was unpleasant. The service we received from all of the staff was excellent, and the outdoor terrace lounge serves amazing cocktails. We used the chauffeur service to and from the airport which was well worth the money. I was a little worried before we arrived that the hotel was too far from the city centre, but the metro is about a 2 minute walk from the hotel entrance and it is so simple and cheap to use. We actually enjoyed coming back to a quieter area of the city each evening, and we probably experienced more by doing so.Overall, I thoroughly recommend this hotel and the Corinthia brand - am currently deciding which Corinthia to visit next!"
Sep 2015,40,Great start to vacation! ,"Great start to our 10 day trip! Driving up to the hotel it didn't look as nice as it was inside! Inside the lobby was huge with lots of seating. Doorman was always there to help with taxis and luggage. Lots of staff at the hotel spoke English!! Rooms were very big! Everything was clean and you had everything you would need. The restaurant was AMAZING! We have both a gluten and nut allergy and they made us feel more than comfortable!! It also had a very nice courtyard to sit and watch the game in. Not that close to everything but only a 10 minute taxi ride away. Staff was very helpful in helping us find things to do although there was a slight language barrier at times. Overall, it was a great hotel!"
Sep 2015,50,Beautiful elegant modern - absolute bargain,"Stayed here with other half and 2 teenagers. We had a junior suite with interconnecting exec twin. The room was amazing, so large and the bed was so comfy and soft.The added bonus of course was free entry into the sky lounge. There was always beer, wine and water plus snacks available complimentary and we had our breakfast in here also. Attention to detail just exquisite. The hotel throughout has beautiful clean lines and the outdoor terrace bar is like an oasis. Everyone so friendly and to be fair not too costly, although 10 euros for a chocolate bar is a stretch!! We picked up this on a bargain rate of 78 euros per night with the upgrade to junior suite at 40 euros per night. Excellent bargain and I would thoroughly recommend it. Its not in the centre but taxis are so cheap that it doesn't matter. You can walk across the street to the Zoo which is a really good day out"
Sep 2015,50,Elegant,"Our European vacation started at the Hotel Corinthia Lisbon. I must say I was very impressed with this hotel from the very beginning. Although we arrived sometime around 10 am and the check-in time was 3 pm, the staff found us a room. The valet  met us at the elevator door to show us how to operate the elevator (you must use your room key to activate the elevator and then punch in your floor number. It will then display the elevator you should enter, either A, B, C or D elevator). When we arrived at our floor, the valet was already there with our luggage and showed us to our room.Our room happened to have an expansive view of the city center and the river."
Aug 2015,40,Good for business and great outdoor area.,"I stay here often with work and always enjoy sitting outside and enjoying the music and water feature and huge screen TV! Lovely cocktails and nice beers and the service is very good. The rooms a nice and clean but the cleaners are very noisy during the day, difficult if your trying to sleep before travelling home."
Aug 2015,50,short stay at this the corinthia hotel Lisbon. Beauty UK,"This hotel is lovely its spotlessly clean rooms are well equipped and give stunning views of the area ,the location is very good with bus tops and the railway network just a short walk away ,the staff or members of this hotel are just lovely always smiling and very helpful  ,we enjoyed our stay and recommend this hotel ."
Aug 2015,50,Great Hotel,"Lovely hotel, really convenient (right next to the Metro stop which takes you anywhere you need to go). The staff were all really friendly and helpful during our week long stay. The rooms are great and the bed was so comfortable. We had an amazing view from our 18th floor room. Lovely bars inside and out. The pool is not that large so once there are kids in there there's not much space to swim. You need to remember to bring your own swimming hat if you want to swim."
Aug 2015,50,A 5 star hotel you can afford - good value for money,"Located 2 KMs from the city center of Lisbon, Corinthia offers a 5 star hotel experience.   Over the years, I have stayed 5-6 times in the hotel. Very nice rooms, well functioning wifi and a very service minded staff. The breakfast buffet is enormous - and there are always free tables - even in peak hours. The hotel garden is transformed into a relaxing lounge area - perfect when the weather is fine. Nice swimming pool, but you are forced to use a swimcap.Though located in the outskirt, if is close to the airport and it is well connected to the main traffic roads around the city."
Aug 2015,50,Great but no exterior pool,"We really enjoyed our stay at Corinthia hotel! Everything is clean, the breakfast is really good. We were just a bit disappointed there was no exterior pool, we should have read the description better. I recommend this hotel!"
Aug 2015,50,Amazing Stay,"Stayed in this hotel last week and had an great time. Staff were friendly and the customer help desk was amazing for maps and information for what to do in the area. The room was lovely and honestly had the comfiest bed i've ever slept in in my life! Tv had loads of channels, games and alot of new movies (at a charge of 10 euros). It was also my birthday during my stay and they brought up a beautiful chocolate cake and champagne! I was so suprised and it was very unexpected. Hotel and room was always beautifully clean. If i had one thing to nit pick at is would be that house keeping knock on the doors a bit too early and its quite nice to have a slight lie in the morning!"
Aug 2015,50,Excellent hotel!,"Absolutely cannot fault this hotel.  The service levels, ambience and facilities all tremendous.  We paid the extra for the Exec lounge, we usually do in hotels as we need to work.  The facilities were great, the breakfast fantastic and I would say one of the best we have experienced...(along with Hong Kong).The staff are gracious and they genuinely want to help and provide a good service.Would definitely recommend."
Aug 2015,50,A five star experience,"This hotel has everything you need for a leisure break; comfort, style, excellent food friendly staff and a good location. It's not far from the metro and the zoo (if you are travelling with children). Taxis outside of course. Downside is that it is under the flightpath to Lisbon airport, but that noise is inaudible within the hotel."
Aug 2015,50,One of the best hotels I've visited so far,"I stayed at the Corinthia with a cousin for 6 nights in August, in order to visit Lisbon.The first impression this hotel gave us was impressive: the lounge was very luxurious and we've been very kindly taken care off by the staff to check in.We asked for the highest room available, a calm room with twin beds and a beautiful view. All these request have been granted and we really really appreciated it.Although people would say this hotel is far from the downtown, I can assure you there is a metro station a few hundred meters away (easy to walk to it as there is a large sidewalk), and the downtown is only 10 to 20 minutes away by subway.We usually choose on purpose an hotel outside the city to get a calm neighborhood, and we weren't disappointed at all there.We were also very surprised to see planes crawl near our windows without hearing a whisper... :)The breakfast was great, and the choices were very wide (toasts, jam, croissants, cereals, salty stuff...) and the breakfast lounge was so beautiful!We enjoyed the access to the pool (closes at 9 PM if I remember right), although it was a too small and shallow.There also was a gym but we didn't have time to enjoy it.The lift systems were pretty good for such a huge hotel: you badge the lifts, you input the level at which you want to go, and the machine answers which of the 4 lifts you should wait for. Usually, the wait is not long, although a couple of times, we had to pray for it to arrive before we died of oldness... :D We also appreciated that the hotel provided a free bottle of water everyday. Less and less hotels do so nowadays.And: A MUST... the room was incredibly quiet. We usually have to fight to stop hearing banging noises from neighbours but here it's the first time we didn't have to!Although one night it wasn't stopping, we had to warn the reception about excessive impact noise by 1 AM. The noise stopped by itself, but we didn't find the cause, as all rooms around us were supposed to be vacant.We there was just a couple of things we were to regret, it's the leak from the tub which sometimes made the whole floor of the bathroom be wet after a shower, and the room electronic keys which had to be replaced several times because of their defectuous electromagnetic systems.But all in all, the Corinthia, which was known by me as one of the best hotels in Lisbon is know considered by me as one of the best hotels in the world, and I would definitely recommend it."
Aug 2015,50,An Outstanding  Stay!,The Executive Lounge is the way to go! Attentive staff who see to your every need with a smile and efficiency; an interesting view from every window; snacks and drinks whenever you want them. There are niggles such as the music in your bathroom and inefficient air-conditioning but you forget all of that.
Aug 2015,50,Handy for Lisbon,"On arrival at the hotel we were greeted as old friends,the reception staff , bar staff, waiters, house aids made this a pleasant stay.Request a room looking towards the viaduct, this gives a view of the bridge and Christ the Redeemer statue, both lit at night.To and from the airport a taxi is ten to fifteen euros, there is also an airport shuttle bus no 2 which stops at the back of the hotel, you can also get the Metro a bit fiddly.Jardim Biological Metro station is a few minutes away and gives access to the whole of Lisbon, you can buy a Via Viagem ticket for six euros which will give u access to the whole of Lisbon my Metro bus tram.The food at the Tempus bar is good value, a pianist plays on several nights of the week.Local restaurants in the area, especially across the road from the hotel are popular with the locals.The Gulbenkian museum is ten minutes walk away at Praca De Espagna, free on a Sunday well worth a visit.The Oceanariums is also worth a visit, pre book tickets to avoid the ques, there are also a good choice of restaurants in the area for lunch.You can also visit Cascais and Estoril by travelling on the Metro to Cais de Sodre the onwards by train, thirty five minutes.The hotel itself appears very business orientated but the staff are outstanding, service is extremely pleasant and efficient."
Aug 2015,50,"Excellent hotel, very nice staff","Very nice hotel and especially the staff (nice, friendy, helpful). A very big hotel. The rooms on the top have a very good few. There is also a pool and a terrace there. For the breakfast and all other meals there is also a great terrace outside (with water, flowers, etc.)."
Aug 2015,40,great overall hotel,good location but service can be a little slow checking in/out. the bar food and restaurant was great. we had a twin room and the beds were comfortable and the room very clean. the swimming pool would have been even better if it was outside.
Aug 2015,40,Modern and very nice service,Very nice hotel with great services. Maybe a little to far away from the city center (15 minutes with the subway). But it is no big deal. The room was expecially confortable and the breakfeast simply lovely.
Aug 2015,50,Excellent stay!,"Comfortable and pleasant room! Breakfast offers everything you can imagine. The stafmembers were very polite, kind and always eager to help you! Calm neighbourhood with metro station in front (10min to city centre). So really the perfect choice for a trip to Lisbon!"
Aug 2015,40,Great Hotel -Good Location,"Beautiful hotel. Great service. Easy access to metro and train - making sightseeing easy and inexpensive. while the guest rooms are well-appointed, there is no place to plug in the hairdryer in the bathroom or any place close to a mirror. There are no USB ports in the room for computer/phone/tablet but Guest Services were happy to charge your personal electronic devices for you."
Aug 2015,50,Great hotel with the great view,We spend 2 nights there during our Portugal road trip. Really memorable experience....nice food and perfect service...and the view from executive sky lounge and rooms was wonderfull...and live cooking guy in the kitchen during our dinner was great
Aug 2015,50,"Modern, delicate and very good service","The Hotel was perfect, with very nice staff. But for a long weekend, we wish to stay closer to downtown. The Hotel has walking distance for families visiting the Zoo. Walking distance to the Metro. The city sightseeing bus stop (blue line) was behind the hotel."
Aug 2015,50,Good choice!,"Corinthia was the winning choice once again! The staff is always nice and available to help for any issue, and the rooms are simply fantastic. The breakfast is good but not excellent in terms of value for money, and it could be improved."
Aug 2015,50,Excellent Service,Fabulous stay. Views over the city from The Executive Lounge wonderful Try the thermal circuit at the Spa.  We loved it. Very attentive Staff.  Hotel right next to Sete Rios station.  Handy for us as we came from Faro on the train.
Aug 2015,30,Nice hotel but,"Nice hotel but let down by serviceBreakfast table cleared while away getting toast and other guests sitting at table on our return. Had made it obvious that we were not finished breakfast.Ate in Tempus bar and they could not make a hot coffee even after 3 attempts.Took ages to deliver a club sandwich, and had to send chips back as cold."
Aug 2015,50,Lovely hotel - would recommend,"This hotel was lovely, clean and in a great place located near the metro but quiet and away from the noise of the city. Myself and my boyfriend stayed to celebrate his birthday this weekend, and when I enquired to the hotel as to what I could do to add any extras for him, Rute kindly offered to arrange for a  cake/wine to be left in our room. And true to his word, it was there waiting for us when we got back after a day exploring Lisbon. Was a lovely treat and he was very impressed (especially since it was chocolate!). The staff at the hotel were all friendly and helpful - even at 4am this morning when we got up for our transfer, we were offered tea and coffee on the terrace. Unfortunately we didn't spend time in the bars or restaurant as we spent much of our time out and about but it all looked impressive. Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends."
Aug 2015,50,A very nice hotel,"The best part of this hotel was the Staff. From the doormen, consigers, front desk, restaurant staff, spa, they couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. The restaurants are buffet only with the breakfast buffet the same every day. We didn't eat the dinner buffet. The hotel caters to large groups so this works for them. The metro is right across the street for transportation to old town as well as connections to the coast, etc. The rooms, including bathroom, are large."
Aug 2015,50,Very enjoyable stay,"I loved this hotel and really loved staying there, staff are lovely and welcoming. Breakfast was delicious with a wide variety of different foods! Beautiful looking hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel :)"
Aug 2015,30,Good clean hotel,"Location is not good for tourists but taxis and metro are cheap and the Gulbenkian is within walking distance. Stayed 5 nights on 18th floor which meant no traffic noise and a good nights sleep.king size bed. Only ate breakfast which was ok. Service was friendly but a bit slow; that said, they kindly let us leave a bag to collect on our return through Lisbon despite officious concierge refusing.I guess it all depends on the room price- discounted in August presumably because business customers are few in number.I think we paid about 100GBP per night for a superior room."
Aug 2015,40,Corinthia - crowded but does the job,"Not the best location if you're a tourist, although it's near the zoo, there is absolutely nothing else around ! No restaurants, cafes, shops or anything, so you will be taking a taxi to everything. However, we had a Junior Suite which was spacious and the breakfasts are GREAT ! Loads of choice. The pool and sundeck are a Godsend, when it's so hot outside it's lovely to take a cool dip. very nice staff, stylish and clean. Not sure if it's 5 star, but we had a good stay anyway. Not hushed and classy, it's crowded and full of tourists in shorts !"
Aug 2015,40,Nice hotel with amazing breakfast,"Very nice rooms although non-smoking did not seem to be an option even though we booked months in advance.  They are fully booked in August with many tour groups which can make check-in EXTREMELY time consuming.  Staff are very polite and eager to help.  Recommendations for local venues (live Fado music) were great although directions weren't the greatest.  If you can obtain a detailed map before you arrive it will be much more helpful than the one they provide (many streets are not labeled - thus making it hard to navigate, especially at night).  By far, the best breakfast anywhere!!  Quick easy trip to the airport without an issue of noise."
Aug 2015,20,Lisbon stay,The service that I received at this hotel was certainly not up to the 5-Star rating that it claims to have.I waited nearly 45 minutes to check into the hotel and no one at the Front desk seemed to give a damn that there was a line in front of them.
Aug 2015,50,Short break in Lisbon,Excellent hotel - would definitely recommend it. Staff very polite and helpful. We were given a free upgrade. Our daughter was with us so the additional bed made the room a little cramped. However the beds were very comfortable and the chocolate on the bed each evening was a tasty treat! WiFi coverage was good. Breakfast also very good. Overall I would rate this hotel as excellent.
Aug 2015,40,Very Good Experience,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia Hotel, the rooms were large, beds comfortable and staff extremely polite. We will not hesitate to stay at this hotel again next time we visit Lisbon. The breakfast was magic particularly sitting outside and eating."
Aug 2015,50,Enjoyable stay,We stayed at the Corinthia for 2 nights and we absolutely loved it. Our room which was on the 18th floor was spacious and away from traffic noise. And the train station to Baxia was 5 min away. What we enjoyed most was the availability of the chef at breakfast and the various choices. The staff were helpful and friendly and we would definitely recommend this hotel.
Aug 2015,10,Rooms not ready by the time of checking in,"Get off the ship . Room not ready in time and Service is slow. Hotels lobby looks like gypsy tribe. Tried to have lunch but waiter not approach to us for 45 min. Very disappointed. Stuff doesn't speak English. All you get from front desk is ""I m sorry, next please""........."
Aug 2015,50,European Summer,"This was a FANTASTIC hotel!!! Service was impeccable, rooms were pristine and so much food to choose from. We would definitely recommend staying here. Check in was prompt and we were upgraded to a Executive room. Wifi is really fast too! Great hotel!!!!"
Aug 2015,40,Enjoyable stay,We stayed in an Executive Suite which offered the benefit of access to the club lounge. This proved to be good value for money as it offered buffet breakfast every morning and somewhere to relax through the day with free drinks (including alcoholic) and canapes.Pros: Directly across the road from a metro station. Spacious and well appointed rooms. Firm beds. Beautiful decor. Professional staff. Many restaurants and cafes down the road.Cons: Arrived in late night - neighbourhood didnt feel entirely safe. Limited dining options after we checked in 11pm either in the hotel or in the close vicinity (restaurants and cafes were all closed). The first room we were given had a strong smell of cigarette smoke despite requesting explicitly a non-smoking room. It was an enjoyable stay although I might try other hotels next time I return to Lisbon.
Aug 2015,50,My favorite hotel in Lisbon,"This is my second time in Corinthia in Lisbon, and the experience satisfied again all my expectations. I have been both times in an executive suite, and if you can afford the price (quite affordable) I strongly recommend the experience.The room size and distribution are optimal, the views from the floor 23 are amazing, breakfast, room service, amenities really are aligned with my expectations for a luxury hotel. Even you can enjoy a sofa with automatic massages inside the room.I am sure I will visit it again!!"
Aug 2015,50,Excellent hotel,"We stayed as a family of 5, booking 2 joining rooms. An excellent hotel, nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Great breakfast, so much choice. A smart hotel with attention to detail. Would definitely recommend."
Aug 2015,50,An excellent family hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel, the 2 adjacent rooms were very good sizes to accommodate us and our 3 children (7,9,11yrs) and we all enjoyed the pool facilities and the buffet breakfast was a delight every day.  Guest services desk were brilliant at all times.  An overall thoroughly enjoyable stay."
Aug 2015,40,Good hotel,"Good location, close to metro and only 10 euros in a taxi from the airport.  I had requested a high floor with a view and got the high floor but not the right side for a view of the city.  Room was large but smelt very musty and smoky and furniture was a little tired but it was clean and beds were very comfortable. Friendly welcome at reception although we were left to work out the complicated lift system on our own which was frustrating. On our first morning we were woken at 7am by a wake up call we had not requested.  When later reported to reception they were not at all apologetic about this!Bar was lovely outside in the evening and buffet breakfast we paid for one morning was fairly good value for money with lots of choice. Concierge service was helpful although it pushed the yellow bus tour over other tours and we regretted using this as buses seemed far less frequent than the red City Sightseeing buses and the yellow buses were extremely overcrowded as a result. We were not particularly impressed by their restaurant suggestions either- although this is personal taste. Overall this hotel is good value for money and the location should not put you off as public transport is easy to use and very cheap but I have certainly have far better 5 star experiences elsewhere."
Aug 2015,50,"Excellent hotel, service and facilities, including spa and swimming pool.","The hotel is stunning inside and reasonable price per night. Service was excellent, the food too, and that included an awesome room service breakfast with delicious breakfast food of all kind. The swimming pool was great, quiet, morning and early afternoon, though much busier late afternoon. The spa service is also great. We also spent time out in the waterfall garden in the evening, listening to their great pianist going through a great repertoire of music, great ambiance, though the wifi is weak outside, but then you are there to socialise, I guess. Waiters bring blankets so you can cosy up on the sofas outside. Nice touch!Just a little mis-communication between underground parking and the hotel reception. When you park, ensure that you keep the receipt given to you, half way down the underground parking site, because you will need it on exit. A little pricey at €18 per night, but I guess parking comes at a premium in the centre of the city. Also, remember on check out, when paying your bill, ask if you can pay for parking included in your invoice. We had to pay underground, and because you have to show your entry receipt and get it signed on check out, it's best to do it together. We weren't told this, so on exit, trying to leave the car park, I had to get a carbon copy of the receipt, take it upstairs to the hotel reception, get it signed, come back down, and pay for parking. If I had been told this at the beginning, it could have been done smoothly rather than running up and down between car park and hotel reception. Anyway, the hotel stay itself was great and next time, I will know about parking payment procedures. That aside, we do highly recommend this hotel :-)"
Aug 2015,50,Guaranteed 5 Star,"From the moment we entered the Corinthia we felt welcome. from the comfort of our room to the wonderful quality and service in the dining areas, we would strongly recommend this hotel as one of the better 5 stars that we frequently visit."
Aug 2015,50,Corinthia is perfect,It was my third stay at corinthia hotels and it was amazing as always! I would totally recommend it to everyone who wants to have wonderful time in Lisbon! Don't hesitate just book and go there! It's worth the price!
Aug 2015,50,A great family stay!,Would highly recommend for families. It was the only place I came across that had family rooms in a luxury setting without an inflated price. The breakfast and evening buffets are fantastic and the pool was much loved by the children. We liked the little touches and felt it was a perfect base to see the city with access close to the metro. Guest services were very helpful when planning trips. Our only criticism would be that in arrival guests need more of a quick overview of the hotel. For example it was another guest who had to show us how to use the lift system whereas this would have been better if we had been shown this by a member of staff.
Aug 2015,50,Above Average Stay,"By Pete & Mary  Aug. 12th, 2015The outside & inside of the Corinthia are impeccable. Very clean, very orderly. A fine tooth comb inspection would pass with flying colors. ALL of the staff, from front door greeting to in door restaurants and cleaning staff, all provided excellent service & politeness. If you were a home office inspector looking for things this hotel could improve on, you wouldn't find anything for this hotel to improve. Concierge service was also over the top. The entire hotel staff are well disciplined & are working together to provide their customers  a memorable stay. It's quiet, near all transportation and within 15 minute cab rides to the airport."
Aug 2015,50,Friendly Staff!,"Cant say anything bad as i got a crazy good online deal on the price, swimming pool and gym is all good, staff very friendly and helpful. location is great for getting to and from the airport (cheap bus shuttle is only €3,50) and right next to Jardin Zoological Metro station which can get u to the main areas in less than 10 minutes"
Aug 2015,10,inflexible staff at check out,"This hotel charged a EURO 17 charge for local phone call thta I had not made. They told me that I had to have made the call since it was on the bill. I told them NO WAY. They would charge me anyways.......Later remeber i received a call about the time i was charged for a call, but I never made a call. The call was from local shuttle and I was never informed it was a collect call and I dont think it was a collect call.so no solution - and that is unacceptable. They can have their EURO 17 - but they lost a customer - unless they call me and make it up"
Aug 2015,50,Modern mixed wtih Traditional - Hotel Exceeded Expectations,"The Corinthia Hotel is an excellent place to stay if you're willing to spend a little extra as it has a higher price-point when compared to similar properties.  The hotel staff carry themselves with the highest standards of professionalism and not just will provide assistance when needed, but they want to provide it.  Essentially, it appears that management/staff relations are good.The rooms are high-quality and comfortable with bedding and towels that are 100% cotton and all fabricated in Portugal.  I was pleased to see this because it means that the management is willing to spend more to ensure a local economy is protected while ensuring high standards.I notified the hotel staff that the bathroom had a slow drain, but it was promptly resolved (although this was done after my short stay). However, the bathroom itself had some erosion on the marble surfaces from normal wear.  I notified the hotel via a survey to address this matter. The hotel is extremely well located - situated in close proximity to the Sete Rios Railway Station and the Zoolologica Metro Stop.  You can get to most places without difficulty.   My taxi trip to the Airport was about $15 Euro including tip.I recommend this property."
Aug 2015,50,Relaxing stay,Convenient place to stay.Pool is not very largeElectrical power points check to see if can charge phone. Staff very nice and helpfulNice breakfastWhen emerging from metro remember the exit name! Enjoyable stay-a nice place
Aug 2015,50,Perfect always,"I have stayed here a few times and it's lik coming home.The staff always have a smile, always friendly,give you all the information you need T reception. Hardly ever have to wait long. I have lucky enough to be upgraded a few times And the suites are well with the money if you can afford do it.There are better amenities, and small touches that make you feel more special.The food is lovely in the restaurant and also room service.There is an outside bar area nicely landscaped and a real sun trap. When the footie is on they have it on the big screen outside. When the night draws in the hostesses hand out wraps to the ladies if they get chilly, a very nice touch . The bar closes late so if you fancy a late night tipple you can do so. Everything is reasonably priced too.The train station is across the road also the metro is in the same place. The ticket machines have an English option to help you get about most times there is a ticket desk person. For the shoppers there is a huge indoor mall 3 stops away, with the most diverse food court I've ever had with really good quality food and healthy if that's your thing.t the back of the hotel the sightseeing bus stops, it's about 4 mins walk. The tour is very comprehensive hop on hop off..Good restaurants very nearby too.One of my favourites in the world I'd say."
Aug 2015,50,A Perfect Score,"After visiting the Corinthia Christmas time and expressing our concern, we were invited back and graciously hosted by the hotel management to show us what a fantastic place the Corinthia really is.  From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we were pleasantly surprised at how different the hotel and staff were from the last time.  Having a very critical nature, we looked for problems and found perfection.  Reuben, the General Manager and his highly professional staff really set a high bar and exceeded it.  Nice work!"
Aug 2015,50,Excellent hotel!!,Stayed here recently in an executive room and use of the executive lounge which was brilliant. All the staff were so helpful. The room was extremely clean and the bed comfortable. There was great choice at breakfast time. There was a super restaurant on site too with quality food.The hotel was convenient for the metro and train station: it was about 100 metres away and the trains were every few minutes and great for exploring Lisbon.Would definitely use Corinthia Hotels again and the executive room.Thanks everyone.
Aug 2015,50,Very nice,"Very nice and clean hotel with excellent views. The Executive Club Lounge is worth the surcharge. Most of the staff are very friendly, efficient and attentive, but there are of course always some exceptions. Overall we had a very nice stay. The hotel is easily accessible by both public transport and taxi, the airport  is close. Wi-Fi is free and works well."
Aug 2015,50,Topklasse! (On top!),"Don't be fooled about the location, as I was at first when we arrived... Not very chique surroundings... But it was all compensated, and more!, by the inside of the hotel... The service, the Room...Executive lounge... Absolutely perfect! In all honesty, we booked the hotel at ""Secret Escapes"" with a large discount, so the money was even more wirth it... Me and my daugther have had an absolute great time, the hotel made the whole Lisboa experience even greater! ( and the location was actually good to because of closenesss to the metro and train station)"
Aug 2015,50,Good service all around,"Friendly and very helpful staff. Quick check in, walked in off the street. Would recommend. Location near bus and trains is convenient. The bed was comfortable, got a good night sleep.Hope to visit again sometimes soon."
Aug 2015,50,"Excellent, but...","Absolutely loved this hotel. The rooms were spacious and well presented and the beds were extremely comfortable. It is located out of the city centre slightly, which in my opinion is no bad thing, but is within walking distance of the red and blue tour bus lines and a taxi to the Centre or to Bairro Alto was always within 8 euros which was reasonable, as was the 10 or so Euros to the airport. Close by is the Zoo and the Stadium of Light and for the shoppers, El Cortes Ingles.The ""but"" was simply the cost of the ""extras"" - the swimming pool for example was free to use, but premiss able only with a swimming cap which was a princely 5 Euros. The drinks ( cocktails, admittedly) were priced to give minor heart palpitations. And the breakfast was, with respect, not really worth 18 euros (there is a little cafe down the street for breakfast, and a corner shop on the other side of the road for those alternatively priced mini bar snacks and drinks) Oh, and make sure you are given instructions on how to use the lift - a complicated affair that involves swiping your key card. Without instructions it took us a little while to master it !The whole experience was, however, extremely positive and I would not hesitate to use the hotel again."
Aug 2015,40,"Amazing hotel, Shame about the restaurant","Very nice hotel, room was nice and big enough. Like most, could do with new carpet in the rooms but the room in general was clean enough. Having to wear a hat in the pool was an annoyance but I understand (ish) why. Shame the pool wasn't outside or under a retractable roof. We also ate in the restaurant in the hotel the first night. They were flustered when we said we hadn't booked, having been told at checkin an hour before we could just walk in. We left the buffet as it had limited options and ordered off the menu. The food took about an hour and a half to arrive and was really disappointing."
Aug 2015,40,Gorgeous hotel but did not like location,"The hotel itself is gorgeous with nicely decorated lobby and rooms. However, the location is just too far from city centre. We were in a taxi for 20+ min to get to Mercado Ribeira. Just created extra hassle during our weekend stay. Would not stay there again because of location.Also disappointed I had to wait till 3pm on the dot to be checked in despite booking through website. I spent 4 hours working out of the lobby after a brutal connection flight, and was told I would be called as soon as a room became available. No call came and other people were clearly were given rooms beforehand."
Aug 2015,30,Good hotel,A nice hotel with clean and spacious rooms. The internet speed was great. You can get a taxi just by going two steps out of the hotel lobby. Sleep quality is good although in a high traffic area. You can also enjoy nice seafood at a retaurant which is just across the street.
Aug 2015,40,Great location & comfortable ,Great location close to the Praca de Espanha metro stop (blue line). There is a relaxing pool (not very big) with small outside deck to sun tan and a 24hour gym. The staff is nice. There are over 20 floors. Rooms are not very spacious but good. The hotel is very clean and there are fresh flowers around the lobby every day. I haven't had any food here therefore I can't say anything about quality and prices. There is a nice view and quite a few bars and restaurants in the area.
Aug 2015,50,Excellent kind staff,"Beautiful hotel and such helpful polite staff. Family room was a little small with an extra bed squeezed it but adequate for an overnight stay. The food was delicious and reasonably priced, great stay!"
Aug 2015,40,Nice business hotel,"Easy access to metro station, which was needed. Pretty rooms and a very good bed! The food at Tipico restaurant was surprisingly tasteful, all the time it had a ""buffet feel"" to the restaurant, both interior decoration and service. The hotel is more business-friendly than family-friendly, perhaps?"
Aug 2015,40,good modern hotel in convenient location,"Good modern hotel in convenient location. Staff was very helpful and the room was comfortable although a bit 'tired'. The cleanliness could be improved upon, bathroom floor did nor appear to be mopped every day. Sound insulation was excellent, aeroplanes were flying right over our heads yet we heard nothing."
Aug 2015,50,Excellente stay,"My wife and me had an excellente stay at the hotel to celebrate an anniversary. It is situated a bit outside of Lisbon, but its really easy accessible by taxi(cheap ride/12min ride) or by the nearby subway(2 min walk to the station). A short trip from the airport. The staff is friendly and the hotel is clean. The building does not look too good from the outside but the reception-area and the breakfast area at the top-floor are great. We did not feel like visiting any of the nearby restaurants. We had a spacious junior suite with a superb breakfast. We did also have the opportunity to access the breakfast-area during the day, they serve delicious fruit, beverages(with/without alcohol), snacks and cake.We will gladly return to this hotel and to the beautiful city of Lisbon."
Aug 2015,30,Average in every way,"I am a big fan of the Corinthia London and it was a member of staff there who suggested I stay at the Corinthia Lisbon when he asked me what other trips I had coming up. What a disappointment.  First, the Corinthia London has a great, central location but the Lisbon hotel is not in the heart of the city that a tourist will want to see. Yes, the metro is close and a good way to get around during the day but evenings means taxis to/from dinner.  Second, the rooms are small (again in contrast to the Corinthia London) and have almost no drawer space to unpack. The first night, when the tv didn't work I had to call the engineer who discovered that the cable had been disconnected--didn't anyone notice?  Next day, the remote failed -- dead batteries--again no one noticed/checked this.  Staff were friendly but generally inefficient/ineffectual--with the exception of the great waitstaff at the Executive Club (thank you for your pleasant greeting each morning, remembering my choice of teas, etc.)  and the Concierges who were extremely helpful in advance of my stay (booking restaurants) and during my stay (calling to confirm, making sure taxis knew how to find the restaurants--often they didn't, and generally providing any other assistance/recommendations as required)."
Aug 2015,40,Good hotel with friendly staff,"Recently stayed for 3 nights. Nice, clean room, with a good view of beautiful Lisbon. Tube/subway station only five minutes walk. Buffet breakfast with plenty to choose from, eggs made to order and yummy waffles.Had three other meals at the hotel. Tasty and well presented. Friendly staff (especially the ones at the restaurants). The only negative was having to pay €7 for a small bottle of fruit juice ordered on room service (same bottle at the restaurant was €3.5...). Dont think the difference in price is justified.Overall, a pleasant stay."
Aug 2015,50,Excellent choice close to the city center; excellent value for your money,"This is a good value choice for your money; close to the city center (EUR 8,--) for a cab ride into the city center; EUR 1,30 for the metro ticket), excellent hotel (forget about the looks), nice terrace, good breakfast. The pool is average and the bathing cap for EUR 5,-- is not really a good choice.But the nice service, good food at the bar, breakfast, and at the restaurant make it an excellent choice with good value for your money."
Aug 2015,50,Everyone should stay here at least once in their life!,"From the moment we were greeted in the lobby by the porters who took our luggage to the moment we left we received excellent, first class service.The room was very pleasant with a great view. The bed was comfortable with quality sheets. We made good use of the tea and coffee facilities. We used the aqua experience twice and absolutely loved it. The bathrobes, towels and toiletries were much appreciated. We ate the buffet dinner in the restaurant one evening and found it good value for money. The breakfast was out of this world; massive variety and high quality. Even the lift was state of the art!Thank you for everything."
Aug 2015,50,LISBON CITY BREAK,Stayed at the Corinthia Hotel for 2 nights during a city break week-end. Hotel situated close to Lisbon zoo near to the metro (3 mins walk) which makes it ideal for getting to/from the airport and into the city centre. Rooms were comfortable and modern. All staff were very friendly and generally very attentive. Breakfast choice and food quality was very good . We had breakfast on the outside terrace. Only minor irritation were the delays in getting coffee refills on both mornings as jugs had run out or staff were busy clearing tables.
Aug 2015,50,Family vacation experience,We liked that it was close to the metro and Sete Rios. The selection at the Executive Sky Lounge was excellent. The staff was very professional and accommodating. This is a very beautiful hotel but the air conditioning in the rooms was sub par.
Aug 2015,50,Hotel Corinthia,Super hotel and great service. Breakfast was fabulous and lovely terrace area to enjoy it. Near the metro stops so getting to the city centre was easy.It was my husbands birthday and we were treated to champagne and chocolate cake. Many thanks hotel Corinthia. Our stay was delightful.
Aug 2015,50,Great value and experience,"After having our flight cancelled by east jet we found Corinthia on Booking.com and decided to try. Excellent experience with attentive staff, clean rooms and great room service. Highly recommend ****"
Aug 2015,40,Excellent City Break,Good choice to visit Lisbon. Whilst not right in centre the Metro is right across the road and 10 minute journey to centre. Hotel staff are very attentive - excellent facilities overall.   Would stay again
Aug 2015,50,Excellent hotel with excellent service,"We had a Junior suite (two adults and kid 9 years). The room was very spacious, clean, excellent air-conditioning and very good beds. The food at the breakfast was very good and the staff was top class. We spent also some time in the swimming pool area, highly recommended and it included room price. Receptionists were very informative and helpful. The distance from city centre is 6-7 stops away with metro and took from hotel app. 15 minutes. Thank you for your excellent service."
Jul 2015,30,Average  - nice pool though,"We were here for 5 nights with our 2 years old son. Staff at breakfast were really friendly to our son even if he was running around and being naughty. This made us feeling a bit easy at breakfast. But if you stay there more than 2 nights, you get bored of the selections of breakfast. (Breakfast cost about 15 euro per adults) The doorman with top hat was also very friendly to our son. Loved the swimming pool. No restriction of children but as others mentioned you need to put swimming cap which are for sale for 5 euros. But the water is a bit cold. Room itself is okay. Bed is very comfy but bathroom felt a bit dated and carpet needs to be renewed. It is 5 star hotel, but I would say 4 star max. But not 5 star price so this makes sense. Annoying thing was that our card key stopped working on our last day after we came back to the hotel. So we needed to go downstairs to gain an access again and to explain that we had a late check out deal blah blah blah, but this should be fully communicated internally or should have made note on their system rather than us to explain things. ５泊しました。２歳の子連れです。一番良かった事は朝食時のスタッフの子供の対応でした。とてもフレンドリーでやんちゃしていても、いやな顔ひとつせず、子供にかまってくれました。でも朝食の内容は二日で飽きます。部屋ですが、ベッドはとても多きくて、寝心地が良かったですが、お風呂場のデザイン等は５スターの割には少し古い感じがしましたし、カーペットも古く感じました。プールもいつでも子供連れで行けますが、スイミングキャップが大人はもちろん２歳の子供でも、要ります。水がちょっと冷たかったかな。一番嫌だった事は、最終日チェックアウトは３時というオファーを受けていたのですが、外から帰ってきたときにカードキーが作動しなかったので、わざわざレセプションまで行って新しくアクセス出来るようにしてもらったのですが、この辺のコミュニケーションが行き届いていないのはどうかなと思いました。"
Jul 2015,50,Great service; great location,"Ample parking for people looking to leave their vehicles parked for a few days as it is a short walk to the Jardim Zoologico metro station. Because the hotel is near the business district, evenings are quite, so it's pretty easy to get a good night's sleep. The room was very comfortable, and the staff is very friendly and attentive. The continental breakfast was one of the best I have had at any hotel. Will definitely be staying here again when I return to Lisbon."
Jul 2015,50,Lovely hotel,Stayed at the corinthia Hotel on a lovely room on the 10th floor. The whole experience from check in to check out was absolutely great. Well worth the price. The restaurant was great and I was specially pleased with breakfast
Jul 2015,50,Lisbon stay,We were in Lisbon for two days and stayed in the Corinthia hotel. We had a really nice breakfast and the staff was very friendly! We took the tagus tour to the city centre and saw most of Lisbon this way. Good value for money!
Jul 2015,50,Amazing service,"This is an amazing hotel and the service is top class! I would defiantly return. It was my birthday and I returned to my room to find a complementary cake and bottle of bubbly, what a great surprise. Thanks for everything!"
Jul 2015,40,Location matters - but not how you think!,"This is quite a nice hotel although placed in a rather unusual location. By unusual - for a first time traveller - away from Rossio and Belem - the two main lively areas of Lisbon but great in terms of transport links. The metro is 2 minutes walk; and the rail service the same. This means getting to places like Rossio / Belem / Sintra and Copa de Arrabida is a doddle. Around the hotel - there is barely anything to do. As such when you are at the hotel - apart from a few restaurants around the hotel there is not in much way of activities. Which means you need to stick at the hotel - which in itself is not a bad thing. The hotel is the usual nouveau 5 star aiming hotel. We were upgraded to the Executive Lounge / level - although we barely spent much time there as we were out and about most of the time. The breakfast in the main lounge is much better than at the executive lounge and we felt the staff in the main lobby seemed to be much more interested in us than the ones who were supposed to provide us with 'executive service'. However the continual 'free' beverages, fruits and pastries can be helpful if you are around the hotel most of the time. The pool is indoor and for some reason you need to have a swimming cap on. If you don't expect to pay Euros 5.00 for the pleasure. We didn't use the spa - although it looked the part for a 5 star hotel and the prices were to match.All in all it was a good - not a great - experience. We went for our anniversary so they did give us a great welcome which we appreciated. The rooms - following our upgrade supplement - was also very nice. The service by the staff in the executive lounge leaves it with a 4 star instead of a 5."
Jul 2015,50,Very happy!,"An excellent hotel - I had considered cheaper alternatives before booking here but a friend recommended it to me and I went on his advice. I didn't regret it! The staff were professional and friendly throughout our stay and the room was spacious and comfortable. They brought up the local delicacy sweets soon after we checked in, which was a nice touch. The spa there is also worth a visit."
Jul 2015,40,"Nice, but not for us!","Beautiful hotel, but wasted for a city break. It is positioned between 2 tube stations, just slightly away from the centre of Lisbon, but not too far.  Restaurant superb - lovely food, just disappointed that the wine we had, which was recommended, was available for 5 Euro just across the road in the supermarket!!Rooms were pleasant and bed comfy; lovely big bathroom. Outside bar was lovely and they served excellent cocktails - great after a long touristy day!The only down fall - which was not the hotel's fault, but would like to make others aware of, was the taxis outside.  We got one to take us to a restaurant we had looked up - there was no concierge around to help us, so we took the one waiting outside.  Unfortunately he said he knew where we wanted to go, we showed him the address, but when we got there, (his English was limited), he just waved his arm in a general direction as to where we needed to go.  We never found the restaurant and the area was not very welcoming or well lit - fortunately not far from the main road, so we found somewhere else to eat.  We did inform the hotel, but they weren't interested - I understand it is not their responsibility, however with a rank outside their doors I felt they should be aware incase this becomes or has been a regular occurance!We loved Lisbon and would go back tomorrow. Think we are better in smaller, more personal hotels!"
Jul 2015,50,Great Hotel,"Returned from a recent leisure stay at the Lisbon Corinthia.We booked an executive suite situated on the 21st floor. Well worth the money for the luxury, space & views & of course you get entry to the executive lounge situated on the 24th floor.We have stayed at the London Corinthia & Budapest Corinthia, so you know what to expect before you arrive.The quality of the accommodation & the friendliness of the staff are a great asset.Could not fault any part of the hotel."
Jul 2015,50,Short Break Stay,"I was in Lisbon for a 2 day trip this July. Booked last minute, and I must admit, for the price I paid, I was shocked that it was a 5 star hotel with a 5 star experience. What a bargain! Great location, great staff and fantastic room. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone who visits Lisbon."
Jul 2015,50,Great hotel,"My friend and I spent six nights in the Corinitha.  The hotel is in a great location, near the airport, train station, and hop on hop off bus pickup.  We were given a fabulous room on the 23 Rd floor with a magnificent view.  The beds, pillows were really comfortable, and the room was always spotless. We are experienced traveller and we would certainly  recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Lisbon."
Jul 2015,50,Birthday stay,"This is my 3rd stay at the Corinthia and was even better than the last two. My daughter accompanied me for my birthday which took place during our stay. We had an Executive Suite this time which was superb in every way. The staff, without exception, were attentive and looked after us really well. the cake and sparkling wine were a particularly nice touch and much appreciated. Th only downside was that we missed the Executive Club check in as they receptionist on that desk was already tied up with another customer. We shall be back!"
Jul 2015,50,The BEST Hotel,"I went on a weeks holiday to Lisbon with the family.We booked well in advance (6 months in fact).  All I can say is that I have no regrets.From the moment we entered the hotel (1am) we were welcomed warmly by reception.  I had booked 2 rooms and had requested rooms close to each other with a good view.  And to my joy reception had given us 2 rooms, interconnecting, and had upgraded one of them to a suite.  My kids were over the moon !!!The rooms are superb, well laid out and with excellent facilities.  The Wi-Fi is available all over the hotel, and unlike most other hotels I had visited, the speed was superb, no issues at all.On the first morning at breakfast, well what can I say.   We were spoilt for choice.  Reuben, the hotel manager, had already notified the catering team of our arrival and had made arrangements for separatey cooked and prepared halal food.  The chef, Stephen, who is from Kerala in South India, was a gem.  He made us a beautiful breakfast every morning.  Thank you Stephen !!!!!  The breakfast was like a meal in itself.  The selection is so wide and varied and thanks to Stephen, we had a superb breakfast every morningAll the staff at the Corinthia are fantastic. Always there to help and nothing was too much of a problem at all for themThe hotel gym is great, open 24 hours and the pool was visited frequently by my children.Logistically, the hotel was close to the Metro station, which meant that it was easy to get around, so do not let the location deter you at all.  The Metro costs justs 1.4 Euros per trip, or 6 Euros for unlimited 24 hour travel.  You can even use the 24 hour travel ticket on the buses and also on the Trams (you must try Tram 28 for the experience !!)I cannot recommend this hotel enough.I would like to thank Reuben and his staff, especially Stephen, for a wonderful time we had in Lisbon"
Jul 2015,40,Visit for my birthday 3rd May 2015,"My fiance booked this hotel for my birthday which was 04/05/15. Check-in was ok room was nice, we did experince a little disappointment but this was eventually rectified. My fiance had emailed the hotel ahead of our visit explaining it was my birthday on 4th may & that we would be out for the day but wanted to order a cake & bottle of prosecco for me in the room when we returned after 5pm which they confirmed. I wasnt aware of this as it was meant to be a suprise but on our return he phoned reception very disappointed the member of staff apologised & said she would get someone to come up with it shortly, my fiance explained it was no longer a suprise & wasnt happy with this, she then said she would speak to a manager & phone back. Some time later he received a call back they offered a pass to the sky bar & cake & champagne, we were getting ready to go out so it was a bit rushed but lovely nether the less & we had free access for the rest of our visit. The hotel was very well maintained & clean & i would visit again but its quite a walk to town about 50 minutes although there is a metro across the road"
Jul 2015,50,"Super hotel, 15 mins from the airport and 10 mins from the city centre by Metro.","We got a call for a paid for upgrade which was well worth the money. Spa breakfast and pool. Only down side you have to wear a swimming hat. Live music in evening, super sun terrace and pool. Room service well worth a try after a long days travel."
Jul 2015,50,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff, room is comfortable and clean and tidy, the bed is very comfortable, bathroom is spacious. Breakfast was excellent. Free wifi in room. Close to the zoo, close to metro station, nothing much around the hotel unfortunately (looks like a residential area) but it is not far to get into the city centre in any case so it is fine with us. Hotel is close to the airport and taxi costs around 10-12 euros only."
Jul 2015,30,A sub-par experience,"I booked through Corinthia's site, as it promised several benefits over my standard 'other site' booking. These included complimentary room upgrade, early check in, late check out, welcome drink, and a few other things. I initially booked just a room, and was soon upsold to a Junior Suite, and then to an 'Executive Junior Suite', which gives access to the lounge on the top of the hotel.I did not require the early check-in (late flight). The welcome drink was either water or sherry (in the middle of summer), and I did not receive a complimentary room upgrade. I was not able to check out late. So really, I received nothing extra. (I understand this is subject to availability.)That aside, the room was spacious and comfortable, with a few caveats.There's only one place you can plug anything in, and that's on the desk. Somehow, the Corinthia is stuck in the 1990s, where people didn't have personal devices they need next to their beds. It is simply not possible to plug in any electronic device near to your bed. Why?!The extractor fan in the bathroom didn't work at all. When I notified reception, they sent someone up, and I was informed that this is automatically turned off at night... because of the noise! It's not hard to imagine what happens to a sealed room when there's no ventilation. However, even when it was 'within operating hours', it wasn't working. I complained a second time... nothing. (Let's pick this up later)The aircon simply was not cold enough. Now, I do not have unreasonable demands, but do not choose this hotel if you're expecting a very cool room after a day in the sun. It's not possible, and as the general manager explained ""you can actually only adjust the aircon two degrees up or down."" I complained about this twice, but nothing was done.By now, I'd reached the end of my tether and went downstairs to figure this out in person. I met with a very professional, reasonable man by the name of Ricardo (if I recall correctly). He was sympathetic, and explained that there actually was a fault with the extractor, and it was working again. This was true, however, it worked for about two hours, and never worked again. I gave up on this issue.As a ""sorry for your troubles"" gesture, Ricardo offered me... a welcome drink. Yes, that's correct... a welcome drink, either a glass of sparkling wine or orange juice. Now, I did not complain about this, but I'd already paid for access to the executive lounge, where I can have both items for free. How is this not an insult?That aside, the room was quite large (as it should be for a suite), the bed was comfortable. Room service is astonishingly expensive and quite average (25EUR for a steak roll and a milkshake).The executive lounge is definitely worth the money. It's on the top floor, has a great view of (the side of) Lisbon, and has an upper-class feel to it. The swimming pool is indoors, and as such (as is law in Portugal), you require a swimming cap. That'll cost you 5EUR at the Spa. The location is pretty much in the business district. There isn't much around, except a mall which is about a 15 minute walk.The positives:The room was large and spaciousThe staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful. I cannot fault them; they're simply implementing hotel policies.The executive lounge is definitely worth the extra price paid.The negatives:Extractor fan does not work properly or not at all; shuts off at nightAircon not adequate for summerNo benefit of booking directly"
Jul 2015,50,A Night in Lisbon.,We disembarked a cruise on the morning of 7 July and had one night in Lisbon prior to our flight home the following day. Although our stay at the Corinthia was a short one we were very impressed by what was on offer and would unhesitatingly pay a return visit.
Jul 2015,50,Very comfortable stay,"The staff at this hotel were, without exception, professional, courteous and friendly. The  public areas were beautifully presented and the terrace bar exquisite. Our room was comfortable and clean and quiet. The main rail line to Sintra and metro station are just across the road so getting around is easy (and cheap). We found three very nice restaurants within easy walking distance and there is always a queue of taxis waiting outside the hotel to take you further afield. If you do not take breakfast at the hotel there are a few cafes nearby."
Jul 2015,40,Good location..,"Near metro (takes about 15 mins to get to town), easy to go shopping at Colombo Mall & El Corte Ingles. Helpful concierge who gave us tips on how to get to the attractions & also on buying a one-day pass for the transport.Was confused on where the metro entrance was (actually easier to access via the train station entrance). Very quiet at night, so a bit scary to walk back after a late dinner in town (especially for ladies). Booked 2 rooms, requested to be on the same floor & got their email confirmation. Upon arrival, reception told me were on the same floor, but when our 2nd group arrived the next day, they were checked in to another floor."
Jul 2015,50,Excellent hotel for a City Break,"Recently stayed at the Corinthia for three nights with my friend on a city break. Unfortunately our room was not ready when we arrived, however the reception staff arranged a complimentary welcome drink for us. Although a short distance away from the main tourist areas, the Metro was literally a couple of minutes walk away and we found the public transport system easy to understand and to use. If you purchase a day ticket for €6, you can use this on the metro, trams and buses. We also found taxis to be reasonable along with the Tuk Tuk's which I strongly recommend for getting up to the top of those hills!The room was comfortable, bathroom spacious and very clean. We made good use of the spa and swimming pool facilities and enjoyed an afternoon on the sun terrace. We specially enjoyed the outside terrace where you could enjoy a drink in a chilled atmosphere.All in all we had an amazing stay and the staff could not do enough for you. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others if you are looking to stay in a great hotel and in a great city."
Jul 2015,50,Relaxing and professional.,"Delayed flight and when checking in at 1am the reception staff upgraded us to an executive suite. Thank you. Corinthia Lisboa.  Wow, big king size comfortable bed & pillows, gorgeous bathroom bath and shower, views over Lisbon from the 21st floor and so much space it nearly felt like home. The service was impeccable, guest services helpful to all questions, breakfast buffet 10/10 , chef cooking eggs to your liking plus every ingredient a person could want to start the day of is at this Big breakfast. fantastic.Suggest : get the executive suite on level 21 facing the bridges, magnificent views from the rear of this hotel at night. Include the breakfast buffet, purchase tickets for buses and oceanariums from guest service and you will have a beautiful stay. 3 nights enough as you can take the train to the beaches to finish of your Portugal stay.Negatives - swimming pool requires a cap ?.? So didn't bother swimming.                    Buffet dinner in the hotel restaurant is NOT a buffet, little choice large cost."
Jul 2015,40,good,"That wasn't my 1st time, that's mean i really like this place, the room services were very good. the swimming pool is small but clean, as a sportif i really like the gym room, and a very very good breakfast.good place."
Jul 2015,50,Fantastic hotel,"I arranged to stay here for a couple of nights as a birthday gift for my girlfriend so I was expecting good things. What I got was amazing. Really beautiful hotel where they do a great job of having a 5 star hotel right in the city centre. The staff were so friendly, the food was excellent and the spa facilities were equally great. Would recommend this hotel to a friend in an instant!"
Jul 2015,50,"Excellent hotel, excellent experience","Excellent twin room with extra bed. Loved the hotel , the outside space and our room. Perfect space for 3 people who are particular about having their own bed. There was an initial mistake with the booking. I had specifically booked a twin too with an extra bed but didn't get that when we checked in but was sorted the next day.Breakfast is pricey at €18 but hot buffet was not stocked up quickly enough. Waited 15 mins for baked beans and no obvious hurry from staff to refill the chafing dish. So had cold freshly fried eggs with hot baked beans.The outside staff were excellent and it was a good space to chill out and watch the sport on their massive telly.Highly recommend this hotel. It's not too far from Colegio Militar/Luz on the blue line where the Columbo shopping centre is located.  It's right above the tube station. There is a big supermarket there called Continente. Hotel is not too far from Baixa Chiado on the blue line where there are restaurants and bars and near where you can pick up tram 28. It's also about 10 mins from the airport by cab.Love it would stay there again!"
Jul 2015,50,Very good,"Hotel has many restaurants, bars and an excellent pool. Family friendly. Little out of the way but still super restaurants in area. Food buffet in morning was super. Portugal coffee is very cheap and super high quality don't miss out."
Jul 2015,50,Top quality,"Clean, welcoming, professional.The location is just opposite a metro station which is a big advantage.The outdoor cafe area is good. Their Tipico restaurant is above average.Though this is not the best hotel ever, there can be no complaint and hence I have no problem recommending this one."
Jul 2015,50,"Great location, very conveinient","This hotel is a good choice for a city trip. It's not far from the airport by taxi and it's located next to a metro and train station. Room was nice and clean with free wifi. Breakfast was great. As a business traveller, I had nothing to complain about."
Jul 2015,40,"Good hotel, but perhaps not quite 5*","When you go to a 5* hotel you expect a little wow factor, or at least I do. This hotel, whilst not quite providing a wow factor, was solid enough. Its located in a good position for exploring lisbon, based near sete rios. Furthermore if you wish to travel by train or by bus, both methods of transportation are at hand on the doorstep. Ideal. Unfortunately the hotel is let down by the little things, the little things at a 5* hotel are in fact what should give it the edge over say a 4* hotel. The cleanliness, whilst good, was not immaculate (in the rooms). For me this is the first basic principle of a 5*, it must be immaculate. The carpet was stained, albeit minorly, in a few places. However, it was clear it had been given a good, if not excellent clean prior to our arrival.Barring that the tea and coffee facilities were regularly left unreplenished. On the positive, the beds were comfortable and the sheets and towels clean and changed regularly. The rooms were of ample space and had everything required (bar an iron). The staff were pleasant and eager to assist. A good hotel, one which could be a great hotel, but just falls short."
Jul 2015,40,"Good deal, nice hotel, outside of downtown","It's a very nice hotel for the price we paid.  I would say it's a 4 star hotel.  The room is kind of small and there is no iron or ironing board.  It would also be nice to have some different outlets (UK/USA) in the room.  That being said, the hotel is nice, clean and the bed is very comfortable."
Jul 2015,30,Average stay - not family friendly but great location.,"The Corinthia Hotel Lisbon is a huge hotel and clearly has a very high turnover. This was evident by the long queues at check-in. Lots of airline crew. We had booked two rooms - a regular room and a family room. This may be ignorance on our part - but normally a family room is a non-smoking room and we didn't think that we needed to specially request one otherwise. Nevertheless, we were allocated rooms on a smoking floor, with the rooms absolutely reeking of smoke. With a 9 year old and 15 year old in tow, we rang reception and told them that they had given us a 'family' room on a smoking floor. They informed us they were unable to change rooms, and instead came armed with spray to get rid of the smell. This is simply not good enough. I find it appalling that you can market yourself as a family hotel on Tripadvisor yet you place family rooms on smoking floors. Please sort this out! The saving grace is the great location - close to the metro to get downtown (15 mins) and the railway station to get to Sintra (36 minutes)."
Jul 2015,50,Excellent hotel,"We stayed here from July 12-16, 2015 for a family vacation.  Hotel is really beautiful, well kept, and staff is very friendly.  We had connecting rooms which were maintained very well.  The breakfast is one of the very best with a very large variety and high quality.  Only negative was the check in process which was painfully slow, and the location isn't great.  You have to take a train to any tourist sites, though the station is just across the street.  If you plan to go to the pool, bring your own swim caps. They require them and charge 5 euros for each. Otherwise, I'd highly recommend this hotel to any family visiting the Lisbon area."
Jul 2015,50,Enjoyable Experience!,"We stayed after doing el camino, and a refreshing experience, well located ""Corte Ingles Mall"" 15 min walk if you need anything from pharmacy, supermarket or go to a Movie.Hotel ranked in top levels, nice rooms, and good service from staff."
Jul 2015,40,Too short,Very nice rooms although the maid left her water and glass on the table in mine. Rest was clean though. Spacious and tastefully decorated. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean. Breakfast was plentiful and a good quality. Happily return here. €10 fare from airport in taxi.
Jul 2015,30,Not 5*...by a long shot,"After reading the reviews on this hotel, I must say that I am somewhat dissappointed with the outcome.We booked July 10th - July 14th and stayed in room 1515.Why is this missing the 5* mark? - Arrived at check in at 3pm. Waited a good 15minutes to check in. Room wasnt ready, was told to return in 20 minutes with no details of the bar, pool, leave your luggage etc etc. - Returned at 3:30pm only to wait another 15 minutes. Anyway, checked in and was given no details whatsoever. Where are the lifts, where breakfast is served, what times is breakfast from, where is the bar, where is the spa etc etc. The 'basics' - The room. Having stayed in many hotels (see my contributions), I can safely say on the size alone. Not 5*. Cleanliness was good, view was ok. - Guest services. I visited them twice and wished I had taken their names. Can you please advise on the best way to get into the centre....and was given a stern response...where in the centre?!?!...with the most dis-respectful of looks. Erm, i'm sorry it's my first trip to Lisbon....so therefore I dont really know but would like I suppose the main square....this was apparently a real chore. Moving on... - Location. Unless you are here for business. Forget it. There must be similar priced hotels closer / walking distance into town rather than taking the metro 5/6 stops.On a lighter note...The bar. Exceptional service and setting. The staff were pleasant asking how are day was, we recommend this wine etc. Really nice.Breakfast. Once we found out the details, it was really excellent. They accomodate for all travllers.In summary...clean hotel,reception staff/guest services need to improve, wouldnt stay here again due to the location."
Jul 2015,50,The best time we had,The hotel is located in a quiet area but opposite the metro staition and bus lines for tourists so you dont have to use your car to get to the intrsting places. Very good rooms with evry thing you need. The large breakfast room is filled with delicious dishes both inside and outside.The staff is very hellpfull in eny question or requests.
Jul 2015,50,Corinthia Craze ;),"I had previously stayed at Corinthia Budapest and when I saw a good deal for the same hotel in Lisbon, I didn't hesitate to book. I stayed for a couple of days at the end of March for a city break with my friend. We arrived early and was able to check in straight away. Our room was spacious, clean, modern and comfortable. The hotel is not located in the city however the city is easily accessible. The hotel is located near a metro station which is foreign friendly and inexpensive. Tour bus route is located at the back entrance of the hotel. There are taxi’s at the front of the hotel on standby. All mode of transport was easily accessible and affordable. The staff were friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. We booked bed and breakfast, Breakfast was filling and delicious, it had everything you could want and more. The swimming pool area was free to use for hotel guest, however to use the facilities i.e. sauna, stream room etc; you had to pay, and purchase a swimming hat (if you didn’t have one) to use in the area of the spa. I had a full body massage slightly on the expensive side but it was amazing! Really recommend the corinthia hotel group, I’ve been to two of the hotels and haven’t been disappointed; although they differ slightly (as they are in different countries etc) the service always delivers above and beyond what is expected."
Jul 2015,50,Truly 5 star. Excellent in every aspect,"The staff were welcoming from the outset. The hotel is clean. Excellent breakfast. We even had a freshly made omelette while you wait and this is just a normal breakfast service, there as a few other people who had their omelette made by the chef"
Jul 2015,50,Royal treat !,"Im so happy that I booked this hotel on my first trip to Lisbon. They didnt fail to impress !Easy access from the airport by metro ( approx 35 mts), with just a couple of minutes from the metro station to the hotel. Very warm welcome with polished & friendly front desk personnel. Although we arrived at 11 am ( check in starts from 03 pm) we were given a room within half an hour. And we received a complimentary upgrade to Executive suite...Wow ! The suite was very spacious with a magnificient view of Lisbon city and very well furnished. Bathroom was very comfortable with emphasis on detail. Loved the 24h radio channel in the bathroom. The bed was a double king size & very sturdy, so slept very well. As we were chosen as the 'Guest of the day' on arrival, we were given a 2h access to the spa. I am yet to see a spa grander that this one. Guests in Executive suites have access to the Executive club on the top floor( 24th), where in addition to breakfast, we have access to snacks, drinks, reading material & internet upto 09pm. The breakfast spread was exhaustive continental. The wifi works very well in the hotel & premises.All in all, we felt that we were pampered during our 3 night stay and would love to go back to Corinthia on our next visit to Lisbon."
Jul 2015,50,Perfect and Delightful..,"My Husband and Son recommended The Corinthia Hotel after their last visit to Lisbon.They couldn't stop talking about the experience.Visiting Portugal on our one week summer vacation we decided to finish off at the Corinthia for the last 3 days.We had stayed in other hotels in Lisbon and Porto but Truth be said I wish we hadn't gone anywhere at all!The location is great ,easily accessible and not too far from shopping and tour areas.Very high quality and truly beautiful place.This Hotel manages to get it all right despite the size and adds its own special and personal touch.An upgrade to the Executive Floor,large rooms,clean,excellently furnished and comfortable beds that we snuggled in and didn't want to leave.Breakfast was amazing with varied selections and nothing you asked for was too much for them.All three teenagers had nothing to complain about and agreed that it definitely deserves 5 stars.Finally we were granted a late checkout till 4 pm to enable us catch our late evening flight ,The perfect and delightful icing on the cake.We definitely are coming back to our No1 hotel in Lisbon....To all the team well done and please keep up the good work."
Jul 2015,50,Great location and fabulous service,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a family trip for my sisters 40th and must say it really made the trip. The location although not central was walking distance to the metro stop (on the blue line straight to the centre of town) and the train station (direct trains to Sintra). There was also a great Chinese across the road to the right called Wok which did great value and quality buffet. The service at the hotel was exceptional. My sister had a lovely chocolate cake and champagne delivered to the room. The guest services team were really friendly and professional, got some great advice & tips. The breakfast was excellent and Steve (south Indian chef) made some exceptional Indian vegetarian dishes for my Mother on request, which was a great extra touch. The WiFi was free and good coverage throughout the hotel."
Jul 2015,50,Perfect business hotel,"High quality hotel. Central location in Lisbon. A warm feeling when entering the luxury lobby and friendly people. Nice and complete rooms, some with a wonderful view over the old aquaduct. Complete bathroom with all you might need. Good and fast Wifi. Breakfast is complete although I could not find the yoghurt. Also there very friendly employees."
Jul 2015,40,Summer family visit,"The hotel is beautiful. Rooms are really nice, but some odor comes out of the faucetts.Breakfast is really expensive, don´t buy it, two cafeterias in the same block. A little far from downtown, but if you prefer quiet, it´s a lot better than noisy city."
Jul 2015,50,One of the Nicest Hotels We've Ever Stayed With,"We were put up at this hotel by TAP airlines when a flight delay caused us to miss our flight back to the USA. This was a wonderful hotel. It is clean, well-located, great amenities, the rooms are spacious and it has a wonderful buffet dinner and breakfast! (The restaurants were pretty amazing--some of the nicest we've seen). It is close to the airport, the Metro, and the hop-on, hop off bus stop. We would definitely stay here again, on our own. The elevators are worth mentioning because they are so unique (of course, I would not base your stay on this, but we'd never seen anything like this before). You press in the number of the floor you want to go to (rather than pressing an up or down arrow) and it tells you which elevator to take. You get on the elevator and never have to press a floor, it remembers the number and takes you there. (See photo 7)We talked to a few people at the hotel who came for the beaches and said they always stay there. That's a good sign.We would definitely recommend this hotel!"
Jul 2015,40,Great hotel,"Stayed for one night while on a recent business trip to Lisbon.  Wonderful spacious rooms, elegantly decorated, large bathroom.  Very nice common areas, indoor and outdoor lounge bar area.  Service was attentive and professional.  Very good breakfast.  A very good option in Lisbon."
Jul 2015,50,Excellent Hotel and great team of staff member,"we stayed here for 3 nights in the Junior Suite and we truly thank you for the services we got from hotel and their staff members. All of the team members at Corinthia is really helpful and going out of their ways to help us. We love everything about this hotel  including room services, house keeping, front office staff and guest relation officers. The breakfast is amazing. This hotel should be on anybody's shortlist who wants to go on holiday in Lisbon. My son really wanted to stay more here, We will definitely come back again. I sincerely recommend this Hotel to anyone who wants to stay in Lisbon Portugal. Thanks Zakeer"
Jul 2015,50,Great hotel in the city - not too far from anything,"The hotel is in the city district so a little quiet - but not to far (5 min cab ride) to town with all the shops and bars. The metro is very close - 2 mins walk, so very easy to get around and explore Lisbon.The hotel staff were amazing. Very friendly and willing to go out of their way to help you.I would recommend staying here. Very competitive price too!"
Jul 2015,50,Perfect hotel stay,"I must admit that despite the very good reviews, I was a little sceptical about finding the level of service one is accustomed to when staying at 5 star hotels outside Europe. I never quite experienced such high level of service like I do in Asia.However, I am happy to say I was wrong. My stay at the Corinthia in Lisbon was great. The staff are really truly nice and helpful, those in the Executive Lounge in particular where everything was just perfect. Daniel was truly one of the best hotel staff I have ever come across, reason in itself to book a suite stay here. I stayed in a junior suite which was lovely, fairly spacious and with beautiful bathroom products. Annoyingly though, the riom does not have enough sockets to plug stuff in and when the light in the room is seitched off at night, the power is cut off from the sitting area/ desk area so nothing gets charged. The Lounge was the best part of our stay, perfect for breakfast (cold and hot breakfast with an egg station), lots of beautiful pastries (chocolate breakfast cake is the best I have ever had in any hotel - sadly that now shows on my waist line!). The lounge offers drinks and nibbles throughout the day with some hot canapés between 6 and 7 - whilst the offering is in no way comparable to that of a 5 star hotel in Asia or the Middle East, I think is very adequate, so a big plus for me.Hotel is beautifully kept, turn down service is offered at night. I did not try the restaurant or the pool. Hotel is very near the underground station but fairly distant from the centre. It takes about 15 minutes to get to Chiado."
Jul 2015,40,Nice room and a delicious breakfast buffet,"I stayed at Corinthia Hotel beginning of June since we had a company's sports event. We were altogether about 500 people. The room was clean and very nice, the staffs very friendly, helpful and VERY patient! Obviously, the check-in and the check-out took some time since we were a huge group but the staffs were always nice and worked quite efficiently. (Thank you very much for your patience!) The breakfast buffet was delicious, they had a good variety of warm and cold food. I really enjoyed having breakfast outside on the terrace!"
Jul 2015,50,Great hotel in good location,"Fantastic stay at this hotel. Upon early arrival, we were offered a room much earlier than booked. Hotel was clean, spacious and staff were friendly.Large choice at the breakfast buffet.One thing to keep in mind - if you wish to use the swimming pool you will need a swimming cap - either bring your own or purchase at hotel for 4 euros.Hotel close to airport (I think a taxi costs about 12 euros or so) and 2 mins walk to nearest metro.City centre about 15 mins away via metro"
Jul 2015,50,Lovely city and a great Hotel,"Was visiting Lisbon for the first time, It was a lovely break, and the Hotel made the stay even more special, well located, and easy walking distance for the town center. the hotel is friendly, with a relaxed atmosphere, a good reasonable priced choice for anyone wanting a nice weekend break."
Jul 2015,40,Ok Business Hotel,"The hotel facilities are great and the staff is very helpfull. There are same details with the room: carpet stains, rust and damage trash can and so on. The location is perfect is next to a metro station and the Sete Rios Rail Station, from here you can go directly to Sintra and other close by palces."
Jul 2015,50,Great hotel,"Great hotel at a convenient location located close to metro. Food was ok and was competitively priced vs. Options available outside. Staff friendly. Rooms were of decent size, free Wi-Fi was good. Nice garden area with live music in the evenings."
Jul 2015,50,Perfect!,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia. Maybe the best hotel i´ve ever been to. 10 minutes from the airport, and a 5 minute walk to the metro. The lobby was great, friendly staff and fantastic rooms."
Jul 2015,50,Lovely stay!,"We had a lovely stay at the Corinthia. I advised the staff that we were there to celebrate my parents' 40th wedding anniversary and they were surprised with a very special greeting at check-in and a in-room gesture. Much appreciated :)Rooms were spacious and clean, beds were comfy and breakfast delicious with lots of different options."
Jul 2015,50,MY STAY at corinthia lisbon,graet hotel to stay 10 minutes from airport   and 15  minutes walking to center  the lobby is great big spaces  and relaxing in colors  arriving the reception you are welcomed nicely and accompanied to your room  the rooms are spacious  and very clean  the hotel also have great outside sitting area the teraace which is very pleasent and offer drinks and food  all day  the spa is very profeesional  one with all treats and the latest equipment especially in water therapy  all staff are nice and very helpful
Jul 2015,50,"Modern hotel, convenient location ","Loved the corinthia, beautiful lobby and great working wifi. Nice gym facilities and hotel is right next to the metro station making it very convenient for getting places. Wifi worked great and is free, staff helpful. They even stored our luggage for us for a few days even though we weren't staying there when we came back."
Jul 2015,40,"Lovely Hotel, very good customer service","We had a lovely break recently in Lisbon and really enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia Hotel. Initially we were disappointed with the room we were given but this was quickly rectified by the duty manager. We were given a beautiful room, enjoyed excellent food and very good service from the friendly staff team. The hotel is very central and very close to the main bus station."
Jul 2015,50,Fabulous AGAIN!!,Having stayed before we returned again and were not disappointed. A genuine 5star hotel with outstanding service and rooms. We booked an executive room and the executive lounge on the top floor is where we ate our extensive array of breakfast dishes.Throughout the day there is a wide range of snacks fresh fruit juice and home made cakes. The view is wonderful.All through the hotel there are wonderful displays of fresh flowers in unusual arrangements.The gardens at the rear of the hotel is a real suntrap with comfortable seating for a quiet drink by the waterfall or for outside dining.Located 200m from the underground it is a good location
Jun 2015,50,Fabulous hotel away from the centre,"Booked an executive room but we were really happy to find out we had received an upgrade on arrival, this made a special trip even more so. The hotel is close to the airport and costs approx 12 euros in taxi and although it's not in the centre again it's between 6 and 10 euros (depending where you're going) to travel in one of the taxis that are always waiting outside. Access to the executive lounge, open between 7am and 10pm for breakfast, pastries, canapés and drinks was a delightful treat and offers great views of the city. There's the opportunity to drink cocktails in the outside bar at the rear of the hotel, but be prepared to pay hotel prices.The rooms were very comfortable, the bathroom was quite bog standard, but Espa products are a lovely touch. I also struggled to find the hair dryer squirrelled away behind the shoe cleaning products in the cupboard and ended up contacting housekeeping to help me find it!It was great to be able to swim at the end of a hot day, but remember to take a swim hat as some of the guests were put off at having to pay 5 euros to buy one. We had a lovely stay here and would definitely recommend."
Jun 2015,50,Very nice hotel,"Stayed at Corinthia last weekend. it's a lovely hotel with comfortable, clean rooms and nice terrace at the back. Customer service is spot on. metro station (blue line) is only 1 min walk from the hotel therefore very easy to get to the centre (20 min). Taxis are extremely cheap, Eur 6/7 from/to hotel to centre, not really needed to use tube much. you can get a 24hrs travel card from the machines for 6Eur to use trains, trams, busses around the city. For touring the city I highly recommend the private tuktuk tours, it gives you flexibility to see more and if you're 4 of you it costs around Eur15 per person , so much fun way for sightseeing. Walking tours would be nice too but must warn you under heath it's not that pleasant to walk the hilly city. Sky bar (roof top terrace bar) is lovely, a must place to visit. Barro Alto region is very nice for especially dinners (outside tables with live music everywhere), very nice atmosphere. Overall it's a great city with very friendly locals.I also highly recommend to visit a stunning/ picturesque town Sintra which is only 40 min train ride from Lisbon. You'd need all day in there as it's one of the most amazing town to visit. best way is to get on hop on hop off buses or private tuktuks or drive. palace and castle are on the top of the hill and quite high up, walking wouldn't be an option. town centre is amazing. Worth a visit! Also from Sintra you could get a bus (no: 417) to Cascais town/beach (takes 40 min) or direct train from Lisbon if you want a nice beach experience , with return train ticket from Lisbon you could stop at Sintra, and come back from Cascais (takes 40 min)."
Jun 2015,40,"Great location, nice rooms and professional service.","The hotel is not that close to the centre but is conveniently located beside the metro and bus stop. There is also a steady stream of taxis outside the hotel which are very cheap. Breakfast is expensive so we found a better bet to be the cafes close by. The buffet dinner was good, particularly the starters and freshly cooked meat and fish. The hot  food that had been sitting out a while wasn't so good. Rooms are nice but there aren't enough plugs and there is no green tea. The pool is adequate but there aren't enough loungers outside for sunbathing and you should remember to bring a swim-cap. The bar is really nice, drinks are pricey but the music is excellent. Overall a very good stay and a great city. Sintra is a must-see."
Jun 2015,50,When business is a pleasure,Very welcoming hotel with nice facilities not too far from the center (taxis are very affordable in Lisbon).The executive lounge and the spa make the stay in this hotel a special moment.Very friendly staff also.
Jun 2015,50,Another Excellent Stay at a Corinthia Hotel,We have previously stayed at the Corinthia in Budapest and loved it so much decided to have a long weekend staying at the Corinthia Hotel in Lisbon. We were not disappointed. The hotel is immaculate and the staff very attentive. We stayed in an Executive room so used the Executive Lounge for nibbles and drinks after a long hot day in the city. The rooms were cleaned daily with a turn down service at night. We had breakfast every morning in the sunshine outside and a meal in the beautiful outside lounge area at night which was delicious and reasonably priced. Another night we had room service which again was to a very high standard. Lisbon as a city is beautiful and is easy to get around..though some hills are very steep.. We will definately be returning. Thank you Corinthia staff for another memorable stay.
Jun 2015,40,Good Value in Lisbon,"We found this hotel to be a good value in Lisbon, and although the location isn't close to any tourist areas, it was easy and affordable to get around by taxi.  There is also public transportation close by, but we opted for cabs.  We booked the executive club level and were glad we did from the moment we arrived.  The lobby was jam packed and we groaned to think we would have to wait in the ridiculously long lines, but fortunately we spotted the executive club check in desk and realized we could skip the line.  Check in was easy along with an offer of a glass of flavored water or port and we were in our room in no time with the luggage delivered within minutes.  The rooms was comfortable and bathroom was nice, although the carpet really needs replaced or deep cleaned.  No iron/board in the room, but they brought one to us right away. There is a lack of electrical plugs and the plug for the hair dryer is in the desk with no mirror, making it very inconvenient.  The executive lounge was a large, comfortable area with nice views of the city.  We stopped by for a little nibble and a drink when we returned from sightseeing early evening, stopped again for a nightcap after dinner, and had a very nice breakfast in the morning before departing.  We opted to have dinner at the onsite restaurant and enjoyed it.  They offer a buffet, which we don't care for, but also had an ala carte menu, which was our choice.  Menu was adequate, food was good and service was attentive.  Service was excellent from all staff across the board.  We would stay again."
Jun 2015,50,Devine hotel,Great place to stay ....great views...fab rooms great breakfast.Didnt like the buffet which we had in the evening very limited choices and I would rather eat the A la carte menu.The location is ideal for venturing else where.The staff were very helpful.
Jun 2015,40,Very good for business - Good location,"Visited the corinthia as part of a look at different possibilities for our annual sales conference.  The hotel was as you would expect from all of the corinthia brand, it was very upmarket, with good food and very personable staff.  The location is very good and in proximity of the Sete Rios train station. Very easy to get around the city from this location"
Jun 2015,40,Very very good business hotel,We stayed here for 5 nights recently for a conference and loved it. We had an executive floor room with access to the lounge area where snacks and drinks including alcohol were available virtually all day. The staff were very efficient and friendly. The room was huge with a big soft bed. We had a great view over the city towards the river. We were right under the flight path to the airport which may worry some people with some noise but we loved watching the jets fly in. Room service was really good as well. The price for all of the amenities and exec floor privileges was excellent. Right across the road is the metro as well as the station so we toured the city and also got a train to see Sintra. All in all highly recommended.
Jun 2015,50,Excellent hotel!,"The hotel is amazing, the food excelent, the people very nice (people at the hotel are very professional and helped me any time I needed their support), the rooms are simply ""wow"".I will definitely come back!"
Jun 2015,50,Amazing Experience,"I stayed at the Corinthia Lisbon for business and was blown away by the array of amenity offerings. Additionally, the level of service by each outlet was spectacular. Corinthia Lisbon definitely knows and understands the guest experience. The bed was the most comfortable I have experienced in my travels. This hotel is a one of a kind experience in Lisbon and a must visit."
Jun 2015,50,nice 5 star hotel at the center of Lisbon,"Lisbon is an old European City. We firstly booked air bnb for this trip. But 4 hours before we took off from Madrid, we were told the apartment we booked was flooded (I think that was an excuse), we tried other air bnb options and accidentally booked an apartment (The driver from the airport who took us there told us this area is for the lower wage, not safe at night), we freaked out and immediately booked 5 star hotel- Corinthia Hotel. Thank to the driver who remind us to find somewhere safe. I think for a old town like Lisbon. 5 Star hotel is a top choice. I had a good time while staying two nights at this hotel. Room is clean, staff is nice, and breakfast is fresh and lovely. Since our flight to leave Lisbon was 8am, so we had to leave hotel by 530am. As a big breakfast Eater, I thought I wouldn't get any breakfast (breakfast service start at 6am), I found they have already prepared quick breakfast bar for traveller like us. Very Thoughtful and sweet. I would definitely stay at this hotel again"
Jun 2015,50,Amazing experience ,"This hotel is amazing from the get go. Not too far from the city centre, beside the train station, but we used taxis into the city for roughly €5/€6 each way which was great value. Friendly receptionists, who greet you as Sir/Madam every time you meet, amazing decor, beautiful outside area serving great cocktails! We had an Executive Room, and had access to the Club Lounge which had amazing views over the city, and unlimited snacks and drinks throughout the day (all included in our room price) - well worth it. Very relaxing up there. Food in the hotel was great. The room was spacious as was the bathroom, which had two sinks (very handy!). The bed was very comfortable. The whole hotel has free wifi which worked extremely well throughout our visit. I would stay here again, without a doubt. Highly recommended. Keep up the good work all at Corinthia hotel!"
Jun 2015,50,Simply perfect!,"I stayed for 4 nights at the Corinthia, both for job and holiday reasons.Everything was simply perfect, from breakfast to the relaxing evening tea time with a nice piano music on the background.People at the Corinthia are all very professional and could help me any time I needed their support.Many thanks to everybody. Renting a car just for one day has never been that easy! Thanks, I hope to be back soon!"
Jun 2015,50,First rate stay,"My wife and I spent a week at the Corinthia and were completely satisfied in all aspects.  Though not near the center, it is just next to a metro stop and a train station with trains going to Sintra.  The staff were super friendly, the room was spacious enough with killer views.  We reserved an Executive Club room and were very impressed by the breakfast buffet, the afternoon tapas, complimentary beer and wine, etc.  We would not stay anywhere else when returning to Lisbon!"
Jun 2015,40,"Nice hotel, great transport links","We chose this hotel due to it's close location (about a minute or two walk) to a metro stop, where you can be in the centre in around ten minutes! It's also right next to the zoo, which if you're planning to visit - is just a stones throw away. It's less than ten minutes away from the airport too, which was nice.The hotel itself was very clean and pleasant and the staff were really friendly. You need to swipe your key card to use the lifts, which confused us at first because we hadn't been told, but another guest saved us from looking silly!My only minor complaint is that the rooms had very few plug sockets, and rather than have the hairdryer in the bathroom like most hotels, this one was stored in a cupboard so you had to plug it in yourself... Fine - if there are enough plugs! But to see in a mirror while I dried my hair, I had to find a socket in the hallway and stretch the cord to get half a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror from the hall. Not a major issue (especially if you don't use a hairdryer!) but was a bit annoying for me.I would stay here again!"
Jun 2015,50,Awesome Place!,"We stayed one night at this hotel.  We arrived early in the morning and upgraded to a junior suite.  We were quickly offered breakfast and invited into the room.  The room was great.  Wonderful views and relaxing bed.  The hotel is a little bit away from many of the main attractions, but it's a taxi ride away.  You can also access the Hop On, Hop Off buses near the hotel as well....which we did.  Great stay and we would stay again."
Jun 2015,40,Very good hotel but...,"Great hotel, very clean throughout. Amazing staff in every dept I had the chance to talk to (reception, bar/restaurant, porter, guest desk). Impressive lounge and easily the best breakfast buffer I tried in a hotel. My negative input would be that from the reception area, I was expecting a room furnishing more in line with the rest of the hotel. Instead I've found the room a bit old and tired. Don't get me wrong, everything was really clean and comfortable. I just wished that the furniture would be updated to a more modern concept in line with the rest of the hotel. For everything else, a really good and well managed hotel."
Jun 2015,30,Pre Cruise stay at the Corinthia,This was just a nice hotel for me. Nothing really stood out except for the exceptional breakfast buffet and the outdoor terrace area where you can eat. Check in was a mess but no fault of the hotel at all. This was arranged by Regents Cruise Lines and was part of our package. Hotel has some resturants nearby to eat at and a pharmacy and small store across the street if you need anything. We went into the beautiful city center and ate at a lovely wine bar. I would suggest that you venture into town for great atmosphere and people watching.We've been to Lisbon many times but this hotel would not be one as a tourist that I would stay in again. I can understand for business.
Jun 2015,50,Excellent Business hotel !,Was in Lisbon for a business conference. The hotel is a bit far from the centre but very close to the train station. The breakfast was superb and I should say I loved the hotel beds. W e tried all the restaurants in here and the food was great. Service was superlative. Definetly recommend this hotel very highly.
Jun 2015,40,Good value & located across from metro station!,"The Corinthia claims to be a 5-star hotel but it's a best a 4-star establishment, which is fine since the price is in the 4-star range. While it's not located in the historic center, it's just across the street from the Jardim Zoologico metro station on the blue line. From here you can easily take the metro and/or bus to most places in Lisbon, including downtown and the airport. Since I had a full schedule of activities in and around Lisbon, I'm glad I did not pay for the Executive extra which includes access to the lounge on the 24th floor, nor did I have time to enjoy the swimming pool or the gym. I did confirm that to use the swimming pool guests must purchase the mandatory 'swimming cap'. I travel extensively and this is the only place that this is required.The reception staff was efficient and friendly. My request for late check out was accepted immediately, and with a smile. The concierge service, on the other hand, was okay but somewhat impersonal. I had much warmer and friendlier concierge service at smaller and less expensive hotels.The rooms, and the bathrooms, with the queen bed were a bit small and less spacious than the rooms with 2 twin beds. The bedding and the beds were of high quality. The towels were thick and fluffy. Security is very good. Guests can only get to their specific floor with the room key card.There's a nice seafood restaurant right across the street from the hotel. As you exit the main door, if you turn right there are several less expensive restaurants, but quite good, restaurants, cafes, bakery and convenience store within a few hundred meters. Instead of paying 20 Euros for breakfast (18 Euros if paid at check-in), you may want to consider having breakfast at one of these cafes or bakery for a fraction of the cost, while being among locals!The Corinthia offers good value and excellent location. I would stay here again the next time I visit Lisbon."
Jun 2015,50,Wonderful Stay,"While not exactly in city center this beautiful hotel is located a very short walk to the metro station across the street.  We stayed here for 3 nights and loved it. It is a very modern hotel with a great back bar area with heated lights for some chilly evening drinks outside.  Staff was very helpful and everyone was very pleasant.  Didn't have the buffet breakfast because we thought it was too expensive so we ended up getting coffee and pastries across the street.  Would recommend staying in this modern hotel and a bonus was the large rooms , especially by European Standards."
Jun 2015,50,True value for money,"Gorgeous hotel, friendly, helpful staff. Beautiful outside seating area morn and night. 5* food and amazing value for money salad/warm/dessert buffet. Conveniently located beside main tram stop. Fantastic spa and 24h gym made our stay all the more pleasurable."
Jun 2015,20,"Nice hotel, poor service","Although rather ugly from the outside, this hotel is nicely decorated, clean and offers plenty of facilities. The rooms are spacious, clean, quiet and comfortable and the shower was excellent. The problem I have with this allegedly 5 star hotel is that the service was just ridiculous. They have a decent outside bar area, however it takes a lifetime to be served and then you're waiting even longer to eventually get what you ordered. It took me at least half an hour alone to be given a 4 euro 50 can of ice tea when the bar area was mostly empty. Check out was an absolute nightmare taking 45 minutes - 1 hour. I appreciate that there were a lot of people waiting to check out but this is a large conference hotel that should be used to dealing with a lot of people in a quick and efficient way. One of the receptionist started taking pictures of how busy the queues were instead of helping out and then another member of staff just walked off mid-way through serving without telling the people waiting in that particular queue that she wasn't coming back! Those people were unsurprisingly less than impressed and had to merge with another queue. The lifts are also very confusing to operate and take a while to arrive, my group waited about 5 minutes for one of the four lifts to arrive at one stage. Those staying on the top floors are unlikely to want to walk 23/24 flights of stairs to avoid waiting."
Jun 2015,40,Great Hotel,"First visit to the Corinthia hotel for a works football tournament. Room was spacious, well furnished and clean. Beds large and comfortable with excellent linens. Food at breakfast excellent and varied - the bread and pastries are superbly fresh. Nothing you would not expect from a 5star hotel however what sets the Corinthia apart is their wonderful staff. From the doormen through reception to the staff they all are friendly, courteous and helpful and genuinely seem to be happy to see you."
Jun 2015,50,Beautiful large hotel,"We stayed here three days prior to picking up our cruise ship.   Our beautiful large room was on the 16th floor. The marble bath had double sinks, bidet, a combined shower/tub and plenty of premium towels.  The staff was friendly and eager to please.  A fabulous buffet breakfast was presented each morning.My only complaint is personally I did not find the location to be centrally located to the city, although it is close to the airport and ships terminal."
Jun 2015,50,"Luxury, 5 star all the way","Great rooms, luxurious in every way. Had 2 executive suites for a family of 5. The executive lounge was beautiful. I was concerned about the location but the metro and train station is a 2 minute walk, providing excellent access to downtown and even Sintra. Really enjoyed the Corinthia."
Jun 2015,40,Nice rooms - good stay,Had one night here and loved it. Door people v friendly and breakfast great. Very handy for Metro and getting around is also simple Would go again as the rooms were large and comfortable with plenty facilities in this large modern hotel.Looking for somewhere to stay that is not too expensive.  Try here.
Jun 2015,40,Lovely hotel,"I stayed here at in May for three nights and it was a really nice experience. The hotel itself is lovely, the main reception was spotless and decadent with fresh flowers everywhere. I know some reviewers complained about the staff and the waiting times to checkout etc. But the staff were courteous and helpful while I was there.Breakfast was very nice, with hot and cold options, as well as pastries etc. I cannot comment on the food in the restaurants because I ate elsewhere each night.Luckily the hotel is right next to the metro and probably takes about 20 mins to get in Baixa. You can also pick up sightseeing tour buses behind the hotel. But if you prefer to be closer to the city centre this hotel not be the place for you, especially as its very quiet around the hotel in the evening. It seems like its more in a business district area.Overall though it was a lovely hotel and I would stay again.PS: If you don't want to eat at the restaurant, there is an all you can eat Chinese buffet down the road, which is very cheap and affordable."
Jun 2015,50,Another great Corinthia,"My husband and I spent 5 nights here on a romantic getaway.  We loved the hotel, the staff was great, the location is good, the room was very spacious and well appointed. I have a bad back, but the bed here was very good.   We had nice breakfast every morning, a very large buffet with some made-to-order options.  We had drinks in the bar, which was also nice.  The staff was very helpful, and we really enjoyed our time there."
Jun 2015,50,"Still excellent, wonderful hotel and staff","Third visit to the Corinthia and had another fantastic stay. Room was spacious, well furnished and clean. Bed large and comfortable with excellent linens. Food at breakfast excellent and varied - the bread and pastries are superbly fresh. Nothing you would not expect from a 5star hotel however what sets the Corinthia apart is their wonderful staff. From the doormen through reception to the staff in the exec lounge they all are friendly, courteous and helpful and genuinely seem to be happy to see you. A real credit to the organisation."
Jun 2015,50,Excellent Hotel,Very good quality hotel enjoyed 4 nights her in May and really pleased we chose it.Staff are very pleasant and attentive and offered really helpful advice when required.Rooms were excellent and spotless as you would expect but do not always get.Highly recommended.
Jun 2015,50,Great Hotel,"Have just spent 4 nights here and really enjoyed the stay.  Very close to the Metro which is inexpensive and easy to use to get to the Barrio Alto for bars and restaurants.  Hotel was very comfortable and staff were friendly and attentive. Breakfast was very good with a decent choice including freshly made omelets, didn't eat here other than breakfast. It was my birthday when at the hotel and they very kindly sent up a free chocolate cake and bottle of Procecco. There is a indoor pool with a small sunbathing area with a few sunloungers, there is also a small gym.  Enjoyed the stay and would return to this hotel again."
Jun 2015,50,excellent hotel,"This is an excellent hotel in Lisbon. We had booked a a junior suite and on arrival were upgraded to a senior suite which was fantastic. The staff were great, friendly and very helpful and the nibbles in the executive lounge were very tasty and welcome after a day in Lisbon. Would highly recommend  this hotel."
Jun 2015,40,I like this hotel,"I only spend one night in business here but the hotel has some details that I liked.  Here is my impression of the different functions that I interfaced with.  The check in front desk appeared OK.  The lady that attended me was efficient but lacked that extra smile.  It was better on checkout the next morning.  Let me also rant about a pet peeve.  I understand that they are obliged by law (is it?) but I do not know why European hotels insist in getting a copy of your passport or ID, i.e. more surveillance state bad habits.The lady explained to me how the elevators worked but it did not sink in (I guess I was not paying enough attention since we all know how to push buttons in elevators!).  Anyway you have to swipe your card on a sensor outside the elevators and key in the floor that you are going to.  The system tells you the elevator to take (A,B,C,D) and off you go.  Puzzling when you get inside and look for the buttons while all the other guests inside the elevator have a big smile. I suppose they also were confused the first time.Rooms are fine while not too spacious.  Bed is comfortable but the working desk and chair is at the foot of the bed and in a fairly tight space.  Do not have room to sit at the desk and someone to walk through.  Also, and this is a significant flaw, there are no electrical outlets handy by the desk.  I had to get under the desk, even unplug one of the lamps, before I could plug my computer.  Bathrooms are nice although they have a single sink and the useless bidet (my wife thinks so). One very nice feature is that they have a section of the mirror slightly heated (?) so it does not fog after the shower.  It allows you to see yourself to shave after the shower.  And one feature that is missing is a small night light (blue LED?) for those of us that age makes us do to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  It is not pleasant to have to turn on the bathroom light as it really wakes you up and can disturb others in the room.Breakfast is well supplied although the food stations are a bit spread apart.  Since it was my first time there I had to take a walk around to understand my choices.  Service was attentiveGym is good.  They have a spa, a pool and a gym.  I used the gym and is well supplied.  It is also luminous with a big window towards the street so it keeps you entertained (better than TV).  Another thing that bothers me is why do hotels have to change more for a massage that the street price?  I refuse to use them because I feel taken advantage of just for the sake of being there. Overall it was a good night sleep with some very nice features while a few details are missing"
Jun 2015,40,Good,"The hotel is well located. Near the metro and close to a nice mall. The restaurants in the hotel (2) are ok but not great. The pool is nice. The bar is not that great. Service is very good, very friendly staff and nice rooms."
Jun 2015,50,GREAT BASE FOR CITY BREAK FOR HUSBANDS 40TH BIRTHDAY,"We stayed for 4 nights from 16th May with family for a special birthday. The hotel is ideally located to get the metro into the city center (under 15 mins, self service ticket machine very easy to use 24 hr ticket about 6 Euros.) The staff were very friendly, attentive without being over the top. The concierge assisted us in doing our on-line check in for our return journey and printed off our boarding cards for us. I had advised them of my husbands 40th birthday and they surprised us with an upgrade, a cake & bottle of champagne in our room! The breakfast was amazing! if you can pre-book a rate including breakfast it is worth it as it is 20 Euros a head to pay there. We didn't eat in the hotel for evening meals, tended to eat in the city as we found a great food hall within the flower market near the port.  Well worth a visit, you can ask a tuk tuk to take you there from the city and there is a metro stop outside to get you back to the hotel.All in all, would definitely recommend this hotel to traveller's who don't mind using the metro to get to the city center and we would most certainly return to a Corinthia Hotel either in Lisbon again or elsewhere!"
Jun 2015,50,One of the best hotel stays ever,"I am in love with this hotel. Seriously. Now that I have been there I am not the biggest fan of the Lisbon if I am honest, but would go back just to be able to stay at Corinthia Lisbon. Service was amazing, room large (junior suite) and comfortable, well equipped with great views. Breakfast buffet had on offer anything you could ever want (and if they served smoked salmon I would scream happy). We have tried the hotel Spa and this was also amazing. If you are going to Lisbon, stay in Corinthia - just across the metro station and few minutes from the centre."
Jun 2015,50,Great hotel... Ease of access to all places,We had a 3 day business conference at this hotel and all amenities were there.. Nice staff and always accommodating. Very spacious meeting rooms with very good amenities. Hope to visit them once more on our next trip..
Jun 2015,50,Perfect Hotel,"This is the second time we have stayed in this hotel, the hotel is superb , the staff are courteous and cant do enough for you , the breakfast caters for everyone and is fantastic.The rooms are spacious and incredibly clean and well presented."
Jun 2015,50,Great stay!,We had a great stay for a long weekend. Nice and helpfull staff and the best breakfast. The spa was perfect and treat yourself with a stay in the executive rooms for a little more.  Would stay at the Corinthia at any time again.
Jun 2015,40,OK hotel a bit outside of the city center,"Located a bit outside of the city center, the Corinthia is a nice hotel for a citytrip to Lisbon. Close to the metro you'll have no problem travelling to the city center. A few pro's / cons:Pro:- Nice rooms / very clean- Great gym & pool- Very nice breakfastCons:- Sink didn't work properly (didn’t feel like moving out of my room again so didn’t report it but know for sure housekeeping noticed it during my 5 night stay)- Price of food / drinks in the bar is crazy compared to normal standards, typically a hotel which wants to make most out of it. Staff is not very interested nor friendly in the bar outside. (especially compared to the staff at the breakfast, which is very nice)."
Jun 2015,40,"great hotel, pleasant stay","Service - all staff were very friendly and polite and very helpful. Daniel in the club lounge was exceptional. Always smiling, cheerful and ready to help with anything, he is definately an asset to the hotel.Location - Bus stop and metro station is only a few mins walk from the hotel, so good transport links however location is outside of the main tourist areas.Facilities - the exec suite had all facilities expected rooms were a decent size but we didnt have time to go the pool or gym so cant really comment, however the facilities were accessible should we wanted to.Breakfast - had breakfast in the club lounge, a good spread with exceptional portuguese pastries. The view looking out at the bridge and aquaduct was sensational loved it, The snacks available throughout the day was also very good. Olives are a favorite and the mini dessertsCheck in/ out - on entering the lobbyyou cantbut help smelling the flowers on the tables, this was very mice and quite striking as you enter. Checking in and out was quite simple however when checking out there was bit of a queue.All round i would say this hotel is very good and provides a very comfortable stay. However for us the location was a little too farCons - tea/ cofee is available in the exec suites howeve3r milk isnt. We got back from an exhausting day and as the club lounge was closed decided to have a coffee in the room, we requested some milk to be brought to the roomwhich we were advised would be about a 10min wait. We waited for almost an hour with no show wyhich a little bit of a downer however we were so tired decided to call it a day and go to sleep."
Jun 2015,40,Very pleasant stay,"We stayed here for a long weekend and the location is out of the main tourist area but a short taxi to most places. The zoo is a walk away, so is the underground. And taxis cost very little to get to the main streets. The rooms were spacious and very clean. And the breakfasts were very generous"
Jun 2015,50,Excellent hotel in Lisbon,"We stayed in Corinthia for 3 nights and they were super great. Staff are very welcoming and helpful. Metro station is very close making the city center very accessible. Zoo for the kids is 5 min away.Rooms were very calm and super clean.Last but not least, we were celebrating our anniversary and the hotel sent us a cake and drinks.Thank you Corinthia for the great stay. We really enjoyed every moment in the hotel.We will sure go back if we visited Lisbon again."
May 2015,50,"Go On, Treat Yourself!","Just returned from a 2 night stay. We particularly appreciated:-- the polite, efficient staff.- the lavish self-service breakfast & dinner.- the spacious, modern accommodation.- WiFi in room.- lift (once we understood the system)."
May 2015,50,One Great Hotel!!,"The hotel is truly a 5 Star property that although outside of the main tourist areas of Lisbon, had easy access to those areas via the transit system.Would absolutely recommend this hotel to other travellers and the Executive Club upgrade is a worthwhile addition."
May 2015,50,Another good Corinthia stay,"Booked through Expedia on a very good value flights/hotel deal. Stayed for four nights and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. We were celebrating and when the hotel found out they put a complimentary bottle of champagne in the room - a nice touch. Nice terrace bar with live music on some nights. The shower cap rule at the pool is rather silly. Particularly as there was no-one by the poolside enforcing it - saw at least one person not wearing one! We had a room on the 19th floor looking over the aqueduct, and it's definitely worth requesting one."
May 2015,10,Ridiculous pool rules,"I was looking forward to staying at this hotel but was shocked when trying to use the pool that I could only do so if I purchased and wore a bathing cap. This was allegedly for hygiene reasons which when I challenged then changed to being normal in Spain and Portugal. This is rubbish as I have stayed in other hotels where this is not required and has meant I cannot use one of the key facilities that I chose the hotel for. Staff attitude was appalling and hotel needs to change its policy to cater for international guests. Not acceptable to say ""it states this on our website."""
May 2015,50,"Solid 5 Stars for this place; food, accomodations, staff are all great.","We spent our first 3 days in Portugal in this hotel in Lisbon.Service and accommodations were definitely top notch as was the food.Staff bent over backwards to ensure our stay was pleasant.All the facilities are clean and modern and they have an awesome Spa and Pool area.We spent an additional 5 days in Portugal traveling the country and this was by far the most comfortable room and bed.This hotel is located directly across the street from the Metro underground and you can buy a day pass and go just about anywhere. You can walk to El Cortes Ingles in about 15 minutes, although uphill on the way over.The Portuguese people are very friendly and accommodating, even in a large city like Lisbon.We will definitely return."
May 2015,50,Stylish hotel where service levels excel,"Just a short journey from the city centre, this hotel is the perfect place if service matters. having booked an executive club room from the moment we arrived (10am) nothing was too much trouble. Check-in was smooth and efficient at the dedicated executive club desk where we were offered a glass of port before being shown to our room. The room itself was super, with great views over the famous aqueduct, a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and plenty of wardrobe space. The executive club lounge is well worth upgrading to - Daniel and his colleagues looked after us brilliantly, providing great snacks and a wide choice of drinks throughout the day. Breakfast was super too with a live cooking station providing omelettes and crepes. It was a great place to catch up on work after a day of sightseeing. staff were extremely attentive and helpful and public areas, especially the piano bar, made it an extremely relaxing stay."
May 2015,40,Great stay in Lisbon,The hotel and facilities including the spa are nice. I had a room on the 4th floor and it smelled bad. After two days of my stay I called reception and within 10 minutes they moved me to a bigger and nicer room on the 17th floor. I appreciated their responsiveness.
May 2015,40,Perfect hotel for business or pleasure,"Lovely lobby and the staff are always looking to help. Outside seating area is comfortable and stylish and the rooms are perfect for a luxurious city break. The staff are constantly looking to help, taxis are always available and any request is never too much."
May 2015,50,Excellent Hotel,"Staying 3 nights at this Fabulous Hotel, Room is excellent, food delicious, pool facilities are wonderful, the lounge area & outside bar area are very comfortable&relaxing,would defiantly recommend this hotel, absolutely love it ☺."
May 2015,50,"Grand Hotel, Absolutely recommended!!","My friend and I decided to book the Corinthia for our stay in Lisbon for 2 nights. We did not have great expectations from it as we did not pay as much as we thought a five star would charge. But boy, were we wrong!!! The Corinthia is probably the grandest hotel in Lisbon. It is right across from the train station and adjacent to the Bus Stop. The rooms were clean and well kept. The view from the 17th floor was lovely as we got a bird's eye view of Lisbon by the night. The restaurant was amazing with a large spread for all three meals with ample vegetarian options. The staff is super-friendly and ready to help. The room had a large TV. Two big beads, bathroom fitted with some really modern amenities (my favourite part was the radio in the bathroom which played music all the time). The beds were comfortable and there was a tea maker et al in the room. So glad we came here in the middle of our trip across Portugal, Spain and France. Could relax and recharge. Thanks Corinthia :D"
May 2015,50,Service BEYOND COMPARE !,"We recently made our first trip to Portugal and had the fortune to stay here before and after a 14 day bicycle trip of the country. From the desk clerks, restaurant staff, concierge  and door persons, EVERYONE was helpful, friendly, offered valuable advice and were ALWAYS SMILING !The ""junior suites"" which we rented were very clean and comfortable. Location was also very convenient and quiet. Away from the downtown core yet conveniently located close to the Metro.Our next visit to Lisbon we will surely stay here !"
May 2015,50,great staying as i expected,"the hotel is situated in an easy area to reach eithr to get to the airport or to get the city centre.great service, the bar and the breakfast room are excellent in either both service and quality of ingredients (food, drinks etc) over all all perfect."
May 2015,50,Beautiful hotel!!,"This hotel is faultless! Within a 500m walk either way for a metro stop and by the zoo.The staff are very efficient, the rooms are spotless, large bathroom and shower very powerful and hot! Plenty of wardrobe space and free safe in room. The seating area outside from the from the hotel bar at rear is a very nice start to an evening. A taxi ride to Bellem (Central Lisbon) or Docas (Santo Amaro Docks) where bars and restaurants await you for a great late afternoon drink or lively night!! Everything you need is situated by the sea at these 2 areas and is a 6 Euro taxi ride."
May 2015,50,Perfect romantic getaway!,"We stayed here for lovely 4 days and 3 nights. Location is not exactly city center, but the metro station is just outisde from the hotel, therefore you are in the center in less than 20 minutes. Very easily accessible. The check-in was smooth, very kind and attentive receptionist, who gave us all information needed after a longer journey. The room was rather smaller than we expected, but it did not make a difference really. We were there to explore the city, not the room. bathroom is well equipped, tho the speaker was always on (day and night) whatever we did. The executive club benefits are really worth it! do ask about it at the chck-in, especially if you dont have rebakfast already included. The personell upstairs is just something extra! They were always super friendly, kind and made sure we had a lovely time. Breakfast is really good, huge choice of frsh fruit, omlets, pastry and so on. Guest relations however did not impress me so much, Zhanna seemed extremely bothered that I am asking for directions and for a city map, maybe she could use some extra smile-training and days off... Lilla was friendly and helpful on the contrary, thank you to her! Gym is open 24h for hotel guests, but there is no staff to help you in case you have questions about some machines.. Spa department we only tried their swimming pool, where they made me buy a swimming cap for 5euros, which I never even used, as I did not swim, but thy insisted that I cannot go in without one. there were some ladies swimming without one by the way... Alltogether we loved our stay, worth every penny, and good location even if not center. Thank you to friendly receptionist who checked us in and all the executive club staff, who made it an amazing stay, special thanks to Martha Chaves for the perfect little attention :)"
May 2015,40,"May 2015: two stays at the Corinthia, Lisbon","This hotel represented very good value for money. Service was excellent. Front Desk staff well trained and very helpful. Restaurant staff as well. Alexandro, for example went out of his way to provide excellent meal service, including ice packs for my wife's sore ankle.The hotel is conveniently sited right next door to the Jardim Zoologica metro and the Sete Rios train station. This makes getting around easy. We would not hesitate to recommend it as a good place to stay in Lisbon."
May 2015,50,Loved it!,"Anyone finding fault with this hotel is either Victor Meldrew or besieged by bad luck...it's spotless, the staff couldn't be more helpful, and the Executive Lounge is my idea of heaven! We have enjoyed Lisbon and staying at this hotel made our little holiday perfect. Thank you all at Corinthia!"
May 2015,50,A perfect hotel,"Arrived very early in the morning, so unable to have our room straight away, however, the staff were very helpful and kept our luggage, and showed us the different places to visit.It so happened the next day was my Birthday,(I think the hotel found this info from my passport when we arrived) and on our return to the hotel at 5.30pm found a bottle of Champagne in an ice bucket, and a lovely chocolate cake, with Happy Bithday written on the top, and all the triminings to be able to eat it in style.This jesture from the hotel was greatly appreciated, and since my return to work, everyone now knows about the hotel.Our room was very clean,comfortable, and big, our view was from the 18th floor, so we saw alot. Cannot give a higher rating.We travel alot, and this is the first time I can say"" just perfec""t!!"
May 2015,20,Arrival experience ,My booker told me that there would be preference in allocating rooms earlier for Junior Suites. Our flight came in at 8 25 am and we had to wait till 1 15 pm to be allocated our Suites. We ate breakfast for which we paid and suited our needs. Since kids were also with us we expected some priority which was missing.
May 2015,50,Excellent,"Stopped in Lisbon after a long golf trip and stayed at this jewel. Rooms were exquisite, the executive lounge was wonderful and trains close by. It was about 20-25 min train ride from the main square near the water. Loved it and highly recommend."
May 2015,50,Great hotel ,"Placed just few metro stations away from the city center is a great options for a longer week-end in Lisbon. Rooms are big, the view from the uper level is great and most important the bed is great. Fitness area is very good, but the pool looks bigger in the pictures than is in reality :) Breakfast is very good with a generous variety of cheese, charcuterie, fresh fruits and pastry. The bar located in the lobby could be an atraction point due to the great bartenders - they prepared some excellent gin & tonic combinations."
May 2015,40,Large good value and quality hotel on the outskirts of the city,"Taxi from airport about ten euro, quick Portugese tutorial from taxi driver a Sporting Lisbon supporter and we went past the ground. Had e mailed before and asked for three rooms on same floor and they were not able to deliver that so disappointed about this in view of hotel size. We had three rooms of varying sizes, all decent enough with easy chair and flat screen tv with movies and sky / bbc news etc.. Large comfortable bed, good size bathroom with bidet bath and shower. Minibar well stocked and good price 4.50 for wine. Rooms cleaned well every day and nice quality toiletries including hair conditioner. Fast hairdryer. Breakfast 20 euro on the day ( could pay 18 e in advance for all days) and includes eggs cooked to order, gluten free bread on request. There is a cafe/ pastry shop a few yards away and grab and go breakfasts on the train station Sete Rios opposite too. 3 minutes to metro into town- fast and cheap. 5 minutes walk to the zoo- can go part way in free and see a few monkeys and crocodiles and children could have a run around. Hotel small pool and good size bar. Service in bar was appalling- so slow to order, to then deliver order and then to pay- so frustrating. Taxis always outside hotel. Our Benfica supporter ripped us off going back- meter said 8 and he asked for 28 and then said it was 18- left a bad taste. Overall hotel great value for money  Feels safe in and outside. The seafood restaurant opposite was lovely and really good value for money. Great Cataplana fish stew with lobster and affordable wine."
May 2015,40,Corinthia Hotel…Lisbon,Great hotel in a wonderful and safe neighborhood. Staff were helpful and knowledgeable of nearby restaurants. Comfortable and clean rooms. Only problem was my kids room…air condition did not work and took a long time to fix. Ended up moving my kids down the hall from us. Wasn't happy with that and manager did not even talk to us regarding the inconvenience of the incident.
May 2015,50,Great Hotel for city break,"Large hotel, well appointed with lovely helpful staff, the evening meal was buffet style but excellent value and very good quality. Breakfast was included on the deal we bought and was good quality. A bonus was the tea tray in our room. We stayed on a city break - the hotel is in the business district but this was not an issue as the Metro was only about 3 minutes walk away. The  Lisbon metro. Tip: buy a day ticket on the Metro you can also use on the electric trams and get around the city very easily with as many journeys as you want to make!"
May 2015,40,A good quality hotel in the outskirts of Lisbon,"Rooms. Clean, comfortable, and well equipped, if somewhat small. Large bathroom with good selection of toiletries.Staff. Courteous and helpful, especially the Tourist Desk.Location. Out of town, primarily a business/convention hotel. Close to Jardim Zoologico on the Blue Metro line. The station has a grocery store where you can pick up your supplies for your trips out. If you like a pre- or post- dinner walk it will be on main roads.Food. Comprehensive breakfast buffet with a chef preparing omlets to order. Lunch/dinner buffet poor, with badly cooked meats. Bar meals, very good. Drinks. 40c beer €5.50, cocktails around €12.Pool. A bathing hat is required.All in all a good base from which to explore Lisbon, making use of a Viva Viagem card ( €6/day) which includes all local regular transport."
May 2015,50,Great Hotel,"Excellent hotel 2 minutes across the road from Sete Rios station.  It's a little out of town, but with the station so close it's very easy to soon be in the city centre on the tube, and there was a plentiful supply of taxi's always waiting outside of the hotel.The area around the hotel doesn't have many eating options and is a bit sparse, but the hotel itself had a couple of reasonably priced restaurants offering decent food.The room was very comfortable and spacious - would definitely stay here again if visiting Lisbon."
May 2015,50,Excellent,"Large business hotel, close to the zoo. Extremelly confortable with everything you need for a nice stay - good rooms, very good breakfast, good location and a very friendly staff. It´s not in the middle of downtown, but close to the metro and 2 stations away from everything. The only downside was that I had booked a Family room but when I arrived it was not available and they gave me two rooms near to each other. Restaurant is very expensive with quite below average food. There´s a very good restaurant in front of the hotel. Breakfast was great though."
May 2015,40,One week stay for business/leisure,My wife and I stayed in Corinthia for approximately a week. The hotel is very clean and offer comfortable rooms. We stayed in a superior room. For two people it's slightly small if one person is only there for leisure. Bathrooms are big and clean though. The best thing about hotel is its food. The quality of food is absolutely magnificent considering the price. The only down side of hotel is that it's little far from downtown though the metro station is across the street. Hop and hop off buses stop is also very close. There are a couple of restaurants close to hotel. One is right opposite hotel offering excellent seafood.
May 2015,50,Luxury at a good price,"We chose the Corinthia because it was opposite Sete Rios railway station, from where we were travelling on to our next destination, and also it was an easy ride from Lisbon airport on the Aerobus line 2.  Everything worked out really well and we were delighted with the standard of service.  We had paid for the grade of room above the basic one but ended up being upgraded to a junior suite, which was a real treat - fantastic views across the city, and fabulously comfortable bed.  We dined in the hotel's Tipico restaurant and the food was delicious, beautifully cooked.  We had a brief stroll around the local area, which is a fairly functional and unremarkable financial zone, but noticed a few local restaurants which we would have tried out had we been staying longer.  Really enjoyable stay."
May 2015,40,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel and excellent value for money. Rooms are large and well equipped. Breakfast is great - everything you could possibly want, including omelettes and eggs cooked to order.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Location wise, it's very close to the metro station and takes hardly any time to get into central Lisbon, and there are a couple of restaurants within walking distance. The only negative for me is the service in the bar - it is by far the slowest and most frustrating I've ever experienced!!"
May 2015,50,Excellent Hotel,"Highly recommended and very comfortable hotel.  Spent 4 nights there while visiting Lisbon.  The location is fine - easy access to metro, trains and buses and taxis are always available outside.  If you don't want to eat in the hotel, there are cafes and restaurants nearby and a little supermarket across the road.  the Hop On-Hop Off bus stop is very near the back street entrance to the hotel and a variety of tickets can be obtained from guest services as can bookings for many excursions and river trips.  The staff are very helpful and friendly and the hotel has a spa and pool and massage etc facilities.  Again, highly recommended and we would certainly stay again in preference to many other hotels."
May 2015,50,Perfect again...,"Cannot fault this hotel, as you can see we have been here a number of times which says it all. The team are far superior to any 5* hotel we have stayed before. The most friendly and professional. It's added bonus for us is the executive lounge, this is accessed when you book an executive room and includes many extras and top floor views over Lisbon. Breakfast is served here too, and excellent. Many options from cooked bacon, eggs, omelettes, crepes.  Fresh fruit, cheese and ham. Something or everyone and all served with a smile by Daniel. The guest services team led by Sandra (who is superb) are all excellent, they are full of advise and are always ready to help. My husband was ill during our stay and they were very caring and asked about him everyday. Many thanks again to Reuben (General Manager), he truly should be proud of his team and has obviously instilled a customer service ethic lacking in other ""chain"" hotels and bought the personal touch to a well oiled boutique style hotel. Housekeeping was excellent, everyday our rooms was clean to top standards and the girls on our floor were very friendly. This followed each evening by the ""turn down"" service and our chocolates left on our pillow were a treat. We missed Roque (doorman) who I believe was off fishing the time we stayed..hope he caught more than just a cold!  We were looked after by Carlos and Domingos who did give me a history of the Lisbon flag, and we discussed the weather each day.  He was a jolly chap and an asset to the front of house.  Always there to help!  I can easily list all staff who helped and impressed us, but I will run out of space. All of the team are great and we never received anything but 5* service. Tempo Bar service and food excellent.  Sonia who checked us in with Ines on the executive desk we're welcoming and full of information.  All the girls and boys in executive lounge, and Andre who was new to the team and fits in well.  Marta with her constant happy smile. Best beds we have ever slept in too.  Quiet rooms and corridors. Thanks all at the Corinthia, we will be back in September. Have a great summer."
May 2015,50,Great Hotel...,"Had a great stay in this hotel, location the only negative, service, ambience, outside bar rooms all nice.  Had a bit of a crazy night and damaged the room had to pay for repairs but the management were very friendly about it despite silly behaviour on our part!!  Actually the hotel is not too far from the major transport hun of Sete Rios so if public transport is required."
May 2015,50,Brilliant,Just back from 4 nights in the Corinthia.We loved the hotel.It was comfortable and clean The staff were all very friendly.The food was good.we ate in the restaurant one night-it was good buffet food.The metro station is very near which is very handy to get right into the centre of the city. (6 euros for a day ticket)Also the train station is in the same building.We caught the train to Sintra for the day.It was only 9 euros for the 2 of us return.Sintra is lovely.There is a tram there that can take you to the beach (45 mins).
May 2015,50,awesome indeed,"Stayed in Corinthia Lisboa and we are  very much satisfied with the experience. Rooms are very spacious, clean and good views of city. Very close to the bus station,  metro and short distance from city centre. Good breakfast. No noise or sounds from the street or the rooms. Very relaxing time. Only one disappointment, we had booked 3 rooms and the rooms were in three different floors!"
May 2015,50,2 days at the Corinthia enabled us to get an overview of Lisbon.,"The staff in the hotel were obviously very well trained and performed tasks quickly and politely helping with trips of the city, booking meals and all other services. They were all friendly and the English was good all round.The room was excellent. Very large bed with loads of lovely pillows and very comfortable, air conditioned and sound proof with views over the city."
May 2015,50,Great base and comfy beds,"The Corinthia Lisbon provided us with a great base from which to explore the city with a Metro station 2 minutes walk away taking you directly into the old town. The room was clean, spacious and had really comfy beds and the bathroom was well stocked with good quality toiletries and fluffy towels and robes. There were tea and coffee making facilities in the room and a large screen TV with a good range if channels. Breakfast was excellent with a huge choice if hot and cold items - I particularly recommend the delicious, fresh waffles! Overall, an excellent choice for anyone visiting Lisbon."
May 2015,50,Tremendous value for the money,"I stayed here 3 nights and I enjoyed it a great deal.  I also used the spa once also and while it was 20E extra for guests, but well worth it.  The fee included use of the swimming pool, sauna, steam room and water therapy room where there were a variety places to walk through or lie in and get a great water massage.I booked my room for about $100 US per night which was a terrific price and I was given a junior suite.My only complaint is that although my hotel room was smoke free, there was a strong odor of tobacco in the hallway between the elevators and my room.This hotel a few miles from city center, but it is close to the zoo metro station.  I found the Lisbon metro easy to navigate and inexpensive.  The taxi to the airport was also under $10.If you take the metro to get to the hotel, the Corinthian is the tallest building in the area."
May 2015,50,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed here with a friend with a friend in the high season, I choose and he was very impresed when we arrived. A good example of a luxury hotel. We were excellently cared for. Not so close to the nightlife but 5-10 minutes in a taxi. I will return."
May 2015,40,Great stay !,"Extra large room with top view (thanks for the upgrade), very convenient location, 5 min walk to the zoo, subway station just outside, super breakfast, very friendly and helpful staff. Nice that some hotels still offer smoking rooms :-) Large swimming pool but could have been a tad warmer. Would book again if back to Lisboa."
May 2015,50,Perfect for Business or Pleasure!,"My company arranged to have our global conference in Lisbon and we chose the Corinthia for this and to stay. The location was perfect for us being a little bit away from the downtown (quiet), yet easy enough to get to by taxi, foot, or Metro (just 2 minutes away). Many of our personnel came with spouses to enjoy a vacation as well. We started the planning a couple of months before, so let me start with that.First, the Event Planner/Coordinator Cristina M. was the BEST! I am sure over the planning period we made her crazy with various changes, but it seems she dealt with all of our needs and changes with ease. Since we had personnel coming from all over the world, the logistics seemed huge, but somehow Cristina and her team took care of everything and were always available..including Emillio the Banquet Manager and his team. Muito Obrigado!The HR Director/Security Manager, Joao V. was also the acting Manager on Duty when I arrived early to help get our personnel organized as they checked in, as well as going over all security concerns/questions I had before the majority of our personnel arrived. He gave me a complete tour of the hotel and went over security measures I needed without any question. He was not only very professional but gracious and available to me at any time. Muito ObrigadoNext was Security Supervisor Marcos A.  Marcos was available to me at any time and made it a point to personally look for me to make sure everything was going well. He kept me updated and worked with me to ensure our personnel were safe while at the hotel. Marcos was friendly, gracious, and Very Professional! He not only became a friend, but I also consider him a professional colleague. Thank you Very Very Much Marcos, I hope we will meet again. Muito Obrigado.Finally, all the Reception Personnel at the main desk and at the Executive Floor check in handling our VIP's, were extremely professional and very friendly, which includes the Guest Services Staff. I know their job can be difficult at times, but I always found all of them smiling and cordial, even with all the stupid questions we all asked them. Great job all of you. I should also include the Doormen who helped with directions and telling taxi's where to take our people, and the Bellman/Baggage Handlers.  All friendly and very helpful.  General Manager Reuben Mifsud should be very proud of his team at the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon, they did a great job and good leadership shows in the professionalism of all his staff!Oh yes, the rooms were perfect, in my opinion, hotel was clean and well maintained, even with our large group and another large group that was there at the same time.  Breakfast was just right with many things to select. I only ate lunch one day at the Tipico restaurant, but it was really good, I mean if you are in Lisbon, you don't want to eat every meal in the hotel with all the great flavors and restaurants in the city.Overall my stay was great and I would definitely stay at the Corinthia again if I return to Lisbon.Thank you Corinthia Team for a great stay!"
May 2015,40,Corinthia Lisbon short break,"Stayed in February 2015 on a 3 night break via BA.at a very good price. Second Corinthia Hotel I've stayed at.The Lisbon one is not super luxury particularly not the rooms although the public areas are nice. the staff were excellent particularly in the bar and Restaurant. Ate in the Restaurant one evening and was good quality and value for money. Ate in the bar on another evening and although very nice, quite pricey (in comparison to the restaurant)May be a little far out from the city centre for some but good link to the metro (5 minutes away) so wasn't an issue for us.Didn't use the Spa / swimming facilities at the extra costs and it was compulsory to wear a bathing cap"
May 2015,50,Be ready to return,"We checked in late as our flight was delayed.  We were warmly greeted at almost midnight.  Check-in process was seamless and the staff were pleasant.  Our room was comfortable and clean.  We chose the hotel as we were going to travel to Fatima the next day by bus.  The bus station Sete Rios is just 3 mins walk away.  Breakfast was beautiful.  Although they were busy, we found the staff attentive to our needs.  They moved fast and always with a smile.  What luxury when you stay in a comfortable hotel where the only product that they sell is service.  I'd say they have done it well and it is truly value for money."
May 2015,50,Very comfortable hotel,I enjoyed my 3 nights at the hotel very much. I was travelling alone and used the room service menu quite extensively and found the food to be quite good and value for money. The menu was quite extensive and had a few different local dishes also.The room was very clean and comfortable and I had everything I needed during my visit. The elevators were interesting - no floor buttons on the inside and although I was able to work it out I think the staff should spend more time explaining it to guests as I spend a few elevator with trips with confused looking people.The hotel is located a little far from the main touristy parts of town but the metro is very close by.The staff were very friendly.
May 2015,40,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed in an executive club room for four nights. The room was clean and relatively spacious with a good sized bathroom. The executive lounge was good, with an excellent range of hot and cold food for breakfast; nibbles/food/soft drinks/coffee throughout the day; alcoholic drinks during the afternoon and evening. The staff were very attentive during breakfast.I used the pool a couple of times: take a swimming cap with you or pay five euros at the Spa reception to purchase one.The hotel is located across the street from a Metro (Jardim Zoológico) and mainline railway station (Sete Rios): we used the latter to travel down to the Algarve at the end of our stay.We walked into the centre of Lisbon on a couple of occasions: 40-45 minutes away.There are a few restaurants next door to the hotel which we used (a Portuguese and Italian). Although the hotel buffet restaurant was nice, it was quite expensive.If we return to Lisbon we're likely to stay in this hotel again."
May 2015,50,Great value hotel,"We unexpectedly stayed at Corinthia due to a refurbishment of tiara park. Overall for the price the hotel is amazingly cheap (you would pay double for the same in australia), with the value in mind i gave an extra mark. The hotel offers everything you would want in a good hotel, nice bed, clean well presented rooms and friendly staff. The only real setback is location in regards to the centre of lisbon, but at the price and the close proximity to the metro (jardim zoologico) this is not a major issue. I would certainly stay again."
May 2015,40,Very nice option for 4 day Lisbon visit,This is a very nice hotel which is well situated between downtown Lisbon and the airport. For our four night stay this was fine as we arrived around midnight and our departure was late afternoon which meant we could maximise our time exploring this interesting city. Journeys to the centre were about 15 minutes - we often had to wait half as long for a metro train to appear! But this was a reliable service and only a few minutes walk from the hotel. We took breakfast a couple of times at the cafe opposite the hotel en route to the metro. Less than five euros for two people to have a massive pastry and good coffee. The cafe feels a bit local but don't let this put you off as they are accommodating for visitors! If you turn right as you go out of the hotel you can walk to the centre in about 45 mins to an hour. There is plenty to see on this reasonably pleasant walk including a great view from the top of the Edward VII park. Our hotel room had all we needed and room service promptly delivered ice to chill our wine. It was very well serviced each day of our stay and the spacious bathroom had a nice powerful shower. Would happily return.
May 2015,50,Excellent place to stay !,"Excellent hotel located not far from the city centre, near the Sete Rios/Jardim Zoológico metro station (2 min. walking distance), bedroom on the 18th floor with a splendid view on the old aqueduc and the 25 de Abril Bridge, very helpful at the reception, the luggage service and the cleaning lady. Did not have the opportunity to eat in the restaurant, so, will have to come back at this wonderful place !"
May 2015,50,Business Trip and Event,"I needed to organise a business trip including a training session for 5 days. Having previously been to the Corinithia two months earlier I decided to return. and hope that the service that myself and my colleagues received was not just a stroke of luck. How pleasantly surprised and pleased that upon my return the service was even better! It really felt like home, same room, meeting room was as I expected and this time there was even less need to outline a list of specifics for my event. The staff really my the stay feel like home - cooking outstanding and the fact that people get to know you really makes you fell more welcome than most hotels I have been to.I would definitely recommend this hotel for the quality of service and the price."
May 2015,50,Awesome Stay,"Staff very friendly and accommodating, facilities for our conference were well organized and the support of the staff was excellent.  The guest room was spacious, clean and comfortable.  An excellent experience."
May 2015,30,Good with gaps,"Just to give some personal background where I am coming from for everyone reading this review: Since over a decade  I am traveling extremely often for business and personal, always international, mostly intercontinental, in North America, Europe and all of Asia, staying on mostly 4 or 5 star accommodations, rarely 3 star. Thus I believe I do have a pretty good idea of standards and expectations one can have when staying at a place of that level. The Corinthia Hotel is in fact a well located hotel and statements made in other reviews in respect of close to airport and metro fully apply. It is a hotel for business, but also many bus trips seem to use this hotel, perhaps due to easy access as it is outside the core city. Facilities are good and to be expected for a hotel this level, no good or bad surprises for a 5 star. All in all though I would give it a good 4 or 4,5 star rating, not a 5 star one. However, there were some not-so-great surprises we had a hard time dealing with:- Keep your windows close for a good nights sleep, the noise from the aircrafts is very high due to close proximity of the airport- we were disturbed by the fact that despite asking for a non smoking room the room was smelly and it once was definitely smoked in.It was so difficult to ask for another room as he reception was almost always very busy with long wait, that we eventually gave up on it. - Same in the hallways in the hotel, which are mostly non smoking but have a smoking area without any separation. Thus the smell is everywhere. All in all, even so we notice that in Portugal smoking in public places is still more common than elsewhere, we believe it would be suitable and advisable for a hotel that level to eliminate smoking all together - While friendliness at the lounge and reception as generally ok, we found that local knowledge seems to be kind of a gap (again expectation is a 5 star hotel). I think I can expect that near gas stations or popular music clubs are known. At times not even the concierge could answer such questions. That I know very different from other 5 star hotels, it did not eel very professional- In general we felt that warm friendliness from the hotel staff in this hotel is mostly missing. While at the reception this was almost ok, concierge service really needs to train their friendly smiles and warm words and the doorman needs to learn to greet his guests going in an out specially when he looks them into the face. This may sound trivial for many, but we generally experienced a lot of friendliness in Lisbon from locals and found it a hard to understand discrepancy walking into the hotel, being looked at and not even greeted. Compared to almost all other comparable 5 star hotels know, this is definitely a one star rating only at best.- Last not least, as mentioned earlier, to get to the reception for some questions or advice many times was a challenge due to lots of people checking in, out or looking for advice. Very busy location. All in all a 3 star rating from my side due to the general impression left behind. For the next trip we would likely search for another place, may be with less comfort but the chance of friendly smiles and words in the morning to give it a good start."
May 2015,40,"Must stay at the Corinthia Hotel, Lisbon","Myself and my partner have been to Lisbon before and decided to try another 5* hotel and I have to say that this did not disappoint us at all.  The hotel is spectacular inside and we had a Junior Suite which was huge.  On arrival the reception was beautifully presented although I think an injection of colour would be nice as it is a bit muted with the colour tones. Nonetheless, the rooms were kept very clean on a daily basis, the breakfast was execellent and the staff at the Tipico restaurant were amazing, especially Renata, Alexandro, Theresa and Paulo the Manager who were always attentive and served us always with a smile.  The buffet food was always lovely and fresh with so much variety to have. We are very impressed with this hotel, what it lacks in location it definitely makes up in the ambiance and facilities that is on offer.  If you like to have a stroll, you can take a 15 minute walk to the shopping centre which is massive or get the metro, which is across the road from the hotel and go to Restaurdoures where you will be in the city centre and there are lots of bars, restaurants and lots of shopping can be done.  One of the best hidden treasures of this hotel was the Spa and the services they offer with regards to massages....wow..what a selection to chose from.  We are now looking forward to returning there again possibly later this year."
May 2015,40,Great hotel and worthy of 5 stars,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is very beautiful, the rooms are very spacious, the buffet & breakfast are great and the room service is top notch. They come to the room twice a day and leave delicious chocolates. The only small drawback would be the location since it's a little far from the downtown of the city (although the metro is just outside the hotel) and the concierge didn't live up to the other standards of the hotel. We would definitely visit the hotel again."
May 2015,50,"Very pleasant stay, great service!","We stayed at the Corinthia hotel for the long weekend. Although it is not in the town centre of Lisbon it is withing easy access by public transport, of if like me you fancy a nice walk to get to know a few neighborhoods then you can walk into town (about 40 min).The service was excellent as well as the food. On our second night we were slightly tired of walking around all day so decided to go to the spa, then go for a swim and finish it off enjoying the lovely evening buffet. Would stay there again!"
May 2015,50,"Modern hotel, friendly staff, spacious room and easy access to city center","The hotel is not far away from the airport, however you can get a taxi to the center that will cost €5 by Uber, or around €8 visa normal cab. Breakfast buffet had a wide choice, and if you have to leave early to the airport or before the buffet starts, they also have a small breakfast bar for you to enjoy. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. Our room was superior double on the 8th floor, had a good view, large window, spacious and clean, 2 turn down service a day, I cannot ask for more. Swimming pool and spa service is brilliant, however remember to being a swim cap to go swimming or you will have to purchase one to go swimming. Overall we had a pleasant stay. Wifi was good."
May 2015,50,Wonderful hotel with great service .very clean stuff is freindly and willing to help great breakfast,Perfect breakfat very clean  Great service freindly stuff Wonderfull hotel great experienceRooms are big great gym Next to metro and yellow bus    Next to mount santo you can make morning runConcierge is helpfull
May 2015,50,"Fantastic hotel, perfect for business or leisure, very high standards","This hotel is fantastic, by far one of the best hotels I have in fact stayed at in a long time. Great location right by the tube, spotless, fantastic service, good quality food, good wifi connection, great executive lounge with a nice view and an amazing 20m pool and Holmes Place gym with fantastic equipment and even a personal trainer on hand!The room itself was spacious with a very comfortable bed and nice big bathroom with twin sinks. There was even a radio in the bathroom. The gym had quite a few cardio machines, free weights, weight machines and the pool was just lovely, big enough to do a proper workout.The best part about the hotel was the service. The General Manager there (Reuben) and the rest of the staff could not do enough to please you. The staff in the executive lounge were happy to squeeze fresh lemons by hand for me to have with my water in the mornings and Reuben even made a copy of the CD which had been playing in the gym as I'd like it so much.This level of service is incredible and faultless having stayed at many hotels around the world with the high expectations I have. Do not look anywhere else.In terms of price we even got a great deal through lastminute.com - do book in advance."
May 2015,50,Real 5 star hotel,"Great staff service and quality of hotel. Room is clean and spacious, with great view. Our TV was in good position, not too high at all.. Breakfast is rich, totally worth it. Maybe ask for espresso instead of the regular coffee they serve ;) room service is reasonable, just don't expect large portions.Taxi from city center to hotel costs €7.Would recommend this hotel."
Apr 2015,50,Wanted a 5 Star Portugal experience and got it at the Corinthia!!,"I began thinking about visiting Lisbon a few months ago, and decided that because I would be walking and exploring all day I wanted to come back to an amazing hotel to relax each night.  After looking through TripAdvisor I decided on the Corinthia Lisbon and hoped that I would not be disappointed.  The hotel was a short taxi ride (8euro) from the airport and as soon as we pulled up we were greeted by the doormen and our luggage was graciously escorted into the lobby.  I went over to the registration desk and got a wonderful surprise!  I had been chosen as ""guest of the day""  and after being told that was directed over to the executive desk where the details of my stay would be discussed.  Part of the guest of the day was a room upgrade, I was given a suite on the 21st floor and also access to the executive lounge.  I think this is what really made my stay top notch!!  The executive lounge served tea, coffee and various other beverages as well as a wide variety of snacks.  There were computers and printers that I could use and the WIFI throughout the hotel was included and the signal always strong!!  The suite was perfect, it was very clean and looked like it was fairly new, nothing had the appearance of wear and tear.  The bed was super comfy and the bathroom had a shower and a full size tub.  There were large windows that looked out onto Lisbon and because we were up on the 21st floor I had a great vantage point from which to plot out my adventures for each day.  The shampoo and bath gels smelled amazing and I loved using them each day and catching the scent in my hair throughout the day.The fitness center had plenty of equipment, treadmills, elliptical machines, free weights as well as machines.  The pool area was lovely a side note is that I had to buy a swim cap in order to go into the pool.  Not a big deal, but also not something I was accustomed to coming from America.  Another added bonus of being guest of the day was access to the aqua terrace.  This was a large hot tub (really large) that had different  types of jets and different areas to either sit or stand and enjoy the massage of the jets.  There was a sauna and steam room which I really enjoyed after walking around all day it felt great on my legs.  Back up to the suite where there was a robe and slippers and a Nespresso machine to make coffee or tea.  All in all this hotel exceeded my expectations and truly made my  trip to Portugal memorable.The hotel was right next to a metro station so super easy access to hop on and go to downtown Lisbon which in turn gets you access to buses or trains that allow you to travel to farther off areas of Portugal."
Apr 2015,50,Excellent hotel,"I've been using the Corinthia Lisbon for all my visits to Lisbon over the last 6 years and it's great, I always book executive rooms or suites and the executive lounge is fantastic, when traveling with young children it's nice to be able to relax with a glass of wine in a confortable environment (not a bar) rather than spend the whole evening in your room. Love this place!!! Daniel in the executive lounge is great too!"
Apr 2015,30,Nice hotel but terrible leisure facilities,"Probably shouldn't write a review when I'm angry but..............I am actually staying at the Corinthia as I write and most of the hotel is very good. I have an excellent room, very comfortable with all of the features that you would expect. The TV is placed in an alcove and is impossible to see if you are in the bed but that's a small issue. Reception and concierge are very polite and attentive and the breakfast was good this morning.I have an unexpected morning free so decided to make use of the advertised tranquil pool and spa experience. What a let down!The pool is a little dirty and there is building work going on at one end. When I arrived it was ok, just a mother and a small baby paddling around contentedly. Then a father turned up with his obnoxious son and started shouting to each other, jumping in and out of the pool and throwing a ball around. The peace was shattered and I decided to move on to the hydro spa area. Back at the spa reception I told them about the disruptive bathers but they couldn't have been less interested. However, they were interested in taking a further €20 off me to enter the hydro area, having already relieved me of €5 for a compulsory bathing cap! When I asked if I could use the facilities to find a little quiet and relaxation I was met with a blunt refusal. Not unless I stumped up another €20.Back to my room after checking with main reception that this is indeed the hotel policy and am now sitting writing this warning.There are a great choice of hotels in Lisbon and it should be fairly easy to find one that is a little more committed to customer satisfaction than the Corinthia."
Apr 2015,50," Comfort, leisure and more!!","Went with my friend for a small escape in Portugal last week. We first insisted to find a great hotel as a reward for our intense working days. Corinthia was our choice and what a good choice we made. The hotel is clean, helpful stuff, great breakfast and above all a wonderful SPA station that i would surely recommend to everyone in need for relax. The location was great with easy access to metro station, buses station and downtown 6 to 7 min away.. I would reconsider booking there in my second visit to Lisbon for sure.."
Apr 2015,50,Amazing Service,Lovely hotel with amazing service. Upon check in there were no twin rooms available due to how busy the hotel was and I was immediately upgraded to an executive suite. I had a couple of issues specifically around the air con and water not draining in the sinks very well and all were dealt with quickly and efficiently. Spa and gym are immaculate and very good sizes. A lovely swimming pool so I recommend pack swim wear and making use of the facilities.Metro is a 4 minute walk from the hotel and its very easy to get around every where. Hotel is 5 minute metro ride from the city centre.I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel if you're going to Lisbon.
Apr 2015,50,Faultless,Spent a wonderful weekend here for a special occasion. We were made to feel very special. Nothing too much trouble for any of the staff. Fabulous facilities in every area. We stayed in an Executive room which gave us lounge access. This is definitely worth paying extra for. The lounge is one of the best I have seen. Rooms couldn't be better equipped. Breakfast was fabulous with very attentive staff. Overall our weekend stay here was indeed faultless. Will most definitely stay at The Corinthia Lisbon again and would highly recommend it.
Apr 2015,50,Excellent,Really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The staff were excellent and very friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. The views of the city are lovely from the top and the metro station is just a short walking distance. Would highly recommend
Apr 2015,40,Great for a business trip,"This hotel was great; the rooms were clean, the staff were very helpful and the food was lovely (especially breakfast!) Room service was great too. It's a little out of the main city, but there is a metro station nearby and it's really easy to use. All in all a great hotel and I would recommend staying there."
Apr 2015,40,OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND ROOM QUALITY,"Easily some of the best service I have received and seen in a hotel, with the odd exception of reception which was rather slow and perfunctory. Otherwise the staff were brilliant - friendly, very strong English, attentive but not intrusive, professional and clearly proud of their hotel. It was also impressive that the General Manager was visible and very much available to guests - he greeted guests in the Executive Lounge table by table during one morning and had conversations with all - very concerned to ensure we were all being looked after. GM also around in the lobby meeting and greeting guests - impressive. The room (executive level) was excellent - separate lounge to bedroom and good sized bathroom. High quality furnishings. Executive lounge was room and airy with wonderful views across Lisbon. The breakfast in the executive lounge was first class - lots of variety, egg dishes cooked fresh and to order and very efficient and friendly staff. In the evening the food offering was less impressive but in other ways was as good. Very good gym, swimming pool and spa which are all recommended.My only caveat is the location - if you want a very central hotel, this is not the one for you or if you want the old city it is a little away from this. The surroundings of the hotel are anonymous and not very interesting or useful in terms of bars and restaurants and things to see/do. As a business hotel it is outstanding; if you dont mind the taxi ride into the old city - then it will be a great choice. If you want to be surrounded by action and buzz, then probably not for you. But I will return for sure."
Apr 2015,30,wonderful hotel minus the hotel manager,"Having done extensive research to attain a truly 5* experience for my friend's special weekend before her wedding I selected the Corinthia.  Giving such a well established brand the service should have been first class. I am very appreciative of the exceptional treatment from Ana who helped us check in and truly gave us that 5* concierge service. My fault lies with Reuben, the hotel manager. I understand there is a professionalism to the establishment and having had a very tiring couple of days we wore our robes to breakfast with clothes underneath. Having stayed at many hotels, it is often acceptable to see guests in their robes at breakfast. Upon entering breakfast we were not told we should not wear our robes by breakfast reception staff. Reuben decided to stare at us whilst we were eating our breakfast and then decided to speak in a very rude and condescending tone to tell us to remove our robes immediately as the breakfast is a restaraunt not a spa. Your tone was so rude and blunt you didn't even give us a chance to explain that, of course, we would have never worn our robes had we been told upon entering. This is not what I would expect from a 5* hotel. It's such a shame that your outburst ruined such a wonderful weekend and all the hard work that the other members of staff put in. I would suggest that if you have to raise such a matter again do not shout it across the table at guests in front of everyone, it's unprofessional and simply a lack of manners."
Apr 2015,50,Week -end Break,We found the hotel to be one of the best we have visited. Thought Budapest Corinthia was great but this was just as good.Staff so friendly and helpful and easy to converse with.The breakfast menu was such a wonderful choice.
Apr 2015,40,Not without its faults,"We enjoyed our stay at the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon and it is good value for money. There were some negatives and I will touch on those first. The location of the hotel is not ideal and there is little to do in the immediate area. There are one or two restaurants and it is more lively in the day. A selection of ATM machines are a short walk away. We booked a Junior Suite and it was OK, nothing special and I wouldn't have wanted to have booked a normal room as they looked to be quite small. The Junior suite was an odd shape and the bathroom had a climb in bath to shower. There were plenty of shampoos/shower gels and the pressure on the shower was excellent. There could have been more hangers and the layout of the drawers was strange. The Executive Lounge is better in the day as in the evening/night, it is far too bright and very difficult to relax in. The Corinthia is a fair way out of the main tourist spots in Lisbon but taxis were in the region of 7-8 Euros to venture out for dinner so very good value.We didn't like the downstairs bar at all, the staff were not terribly efficient, forgetting orders, long waits etc. and the prices ridiculous. Two very small glasses of ''Ginja' came in at over 15 Euros whereas the same drink in an atmospheric square in town came to 3 Euros for two with five times the amount of drink. On the positive side, breakfasts in the Executive Lounge were very good and Prosecco was available during breakfast time between 7am and 11am. Staff in the Executive Lounge were invariably friendly and soon got to know you. The public areas are very nice and there are some lovely flower arrangements. Taxis were always available. The Gents' toilet didn't have any soap available which was a little unusual and I had to use the disabled toilet to wash my hands. All in all, a pleasant enough stay but if returning to Lisbon I would compare other hotels. The fact that refreshments were available all day in the Executive Lounge was a positive and wine and beers were also available from 11am until 10pm closing.Wifi was excellent but the system with the lifts was very frustrating and led to long waits at certain times of the day.Some reviews are, I feel, a little over the top in their eulogies but each to their own and the Corinthia is a good product worthy of consideration if you don't mind taxiing everywhere. The Metro is very near by but we preferred to be dropped off at the locations we wanted after four days of walking Lisbon. The Yellow Hop On Hop Off bus is extremely good value and gives a clear overview of the City with the 48 hours ticket - it stops just behind the hotel and we were glad we used it."
Apr 2015,50,A haven,"Exhausted after a transatlantic flight and the stress of navigating CDG airport in Paris, we were mighty glad to be treated so well. Although we were early, the hotel expedited our room preparation so we could ""crash"" for a while. Everything was excellent, from the service to the staff to the room itself. While the only tourist site nearby is the Gulbenkian Museum, the Metro is only a block away and is an easy way to go to the historic sites in the city."
Apr 2015,50,Always consistent & never disappoints,"I've stayed at the Corinthia Hotel, Lisbon, Portugal a number of times now.  In fact it's my go to hotel in the city.  Reason being it's always been a delightful experience from my 1st stay to the last - it's consistently excellent in the rooms and service from the front desk to housekeeping.  My only regret is that I wish I could stay longer each time I visit Lisbon.The breakfast is outstanding in variety and quality as well as the snacks in the executive lounge on the top floor!  Rooms are exquisitely appointed, spotlessly clean and the beds are some of the most comfortable I've experienced.  I look forward each and every time I book my reservation to stay!"
Apr 2015,50,Fab girlie weekend,"We stayed here for 4 nights and we were very pleased with our choice. Even though it was out of the central area as there was 4 of us the taxis were so cheap, we didn't use the metro. We did use the train to go to Cascais and Estoril which is well with a trip as is Sintra. All the staff are exceptional, so polite and helpful. We had breakfast in our room rate and it was fabulous. So much choice and no waiting at the food station. We also used the spa the day we got there as we were there early and we couldn't get access to our room for a few hours.It was a lovely way to chill out at the start of the holiday. Will go back to this hotel if we return to Lisbon."
Apr 2015,50,4 night city break,"Excellent hotel.  Junior suite room was superb with lots of space and VERY comfy bed! Breakfast buffet was fab - very wide choice of food beautifully presented and plenty of it - fresh fruit, cereals, cold meats, cheeses, salads, smoked salmon, hot items (bacon, sausages, eggs, omelets, etc.), big choice of bread and rolls, cakes, biscuits, and pastries. Although out of the centre of the city there is a metro station opposite and only 15 mins into town.  Taxis always available if preferred at approx 8 euros.  Metro very easy to use and inexpensive.  Easy taxi ride to airport - 15 mins and 10 Euros.  Walking distance of Gulbenkian, Eduardo VIII Park, El Corte Ingles shopping centre. Staff friendly and extremely helpful.  Spa area looked very nice.  Small pool and large gym."
Apr 2015,40,Very clean with great breakfast,"The lobby area was very beautiful and spacious. The gym was clean, it had all the basic equipment, and provided water and towels. The rooms were spacious and nicely decorated while the bathrooms had all the necessary amenities (including a bathrobe and slippers). Every room offered a big complimentary bottle of water.The breakfast was great and one of the best I've ever had (try the local cheese, it's great). The free wifi was the fastest I've ever encountered in a hotel ""remembering"" me even after I changed rooms for my second visit there. The only thing I didn't much care for was their elevators: they were difficult to use with the key card and very slow, especially during peak hours. Across the street there is a market where you can buy water, fruit, etc. Also around the hotel there are restaurants offering a variety of cuisines, such as Italian, but also local. All in all a very good experience."
Apr 2015,40,Tips for a great stay,"The hotel is very comfortable and the service is helpful and quick. We stayed for 5 nights and used the Metro each day, which is conveniently close and cheap, The  Lisboa Card covers transport and saved time purchasing tickets. For a quick and easy breakfast try the cafe across the road next to the entrance to the Metro which makes excellent coffee and pastry for less than 5 Euros for two people, much cheaper than the hotel breakfast. The hotel pool is large and very pleasant. Ensure that you take a swimming cap as they are compulsory and the 5 euro caps provided are not waterproof."
Apr 2015,50,Felt very well looked after,I spent a few nights at the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon and I had a very pleasant stay. All the staff at the hotel were friendly and on hand to help. I forgot to take a european adapter with me so I called reception around 6:45am to find a helpful and attentive voice on the end of the line and within 5 minutes someone was up with an adapter for me. The room and bathroom were very clean and there were a good range of amenities. There was also free unlimited wifi which is always great!I will definitely stay there again if I am ever in Lisbon again. The hotel is also about a 15 minute ride from Lisbon airport so it is very easy to get to.
Apr 2015,50,Superbe hotel with fantastic pool,"We stayed for 2 nights in this wonderfull hotel. Staff was very friendly and very professional. The hotel is located across the metrostation, but it is as easy to take the taxi to the city center. Fee for taxi ride between 6 and 8 euro depending the traffic. Breakfast is very nice and the inhouse restaurant serves a nice buffet formula.  Very convenient when travelling with kids."
Apr 2015,40,Wish we'd had longer,"We stayed for 4 nights last week in this stylish hotel, and wished we had booked an extra night.All the staff were very helpful and pleasant, especially those at breakfast.  Breakfast choices good and varied, though we avoided the cooked food as it was barely warm.whatever time we came down to eat.Our twin room was pleasant and spotlessly clean, although air con a little temperamental.The Hotel is a little out of the way, but this was not a problem as metro very cheap and just a few minutes' walk away, and the area  felt safe.  Also, there were quite a few reasonable restaurants very close by.The nearby Gulbenkian museum was fantastic, and which we only found thanks to  previous Trip Advisor reviewer, Erica B.If we visited Lisbon again, we would certainly stay at the Corinthia."
Apr 2015,50,Celebrating a landmark birthday,"We stayed in Lisbon for two nights to celebrate a friend's birthday. We informed the hotel and on arrival our rooms were upgraded, complimentary sparkling wine and cake was provided and all this while we had booked at a discount. The rooms were very comfortable, the service excellent, the hotel beautiful. We used the lovely pool and paid the €20 to use the hydrotherapy pool, jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. These facilities were worth the charge. Even the hotel's restaurant recommendation for our first night was spot-on."
Apr 2015,50,Truly 5 Star,"We booked a junior suite and were upgraded to a family suite.  The bed is bigger than regular king size and it is very comfortable.  The front desk is very professional, helpful and polite.  Breakfast is very good with variety of hot and cold.  The hotel is 5 minute walk to metro and train station. We took metro to the city and train to Sintra.  Lots of taxi are outside the hotel, waiting for customer.  Taxi in Lisbon is very inexpensive.  We went with a family of 4 with 2 kids age 7 and 15.  The stay is very pleasant and enjoyable!"
Apr 2015,50,Fantastic,Just returned from a visit to the corinthia hotel and it was great from start to finish. The service is completely on point and nothing is too much for the stuff. The aqua services in the spa are fantastic and provided for a relaxing visit. I will definitely be returning.
Apr 2015,50,"Happy visit, nice pool","We had a very nice stay at the Corinthia Lisbon.  It's a bit out of the main downtown, but very accessible by metro so we didn't care.  We were there during Holy Week 2015, and because it is a school holiday here there were many families with children (including ourselves).  We chose the hotel for its indoor swimming pool and we were not disappointed.  The hotel has stated hours for children to use the pool, but as long as they're not too busy or ill-behaved, they don't seem to enforce it. We enjoyed a long swim in the late afternoon, after the ""kid"" hours, along with a bunch of other nice families.  The hotel staff was wonderful during our entire stay, and the facilities are top-notch. We got adjoining rooms in the Executive Suite area, which gave us access to the executive lounge/dining room.  We all enjoyed going up there for the views, snacks, and even breakfast.  We never even went to the main dining room because we were so happy up in the private area.  The breakfast was gigantic with lots of great choices, snack was very yummy also.  Thanks to some earlier reviews we knew to go on the early side before it all got eaten up.  The lounge also provides newspapers and has excellent views above the city.  The wifi worked great, we had a complimentary giant bottle of water in our room, parking was easy and the housekeeping staff was attentive and prompt.  Absolutely no complaints and we would definitely stay here again."
Apr 2015,40,Excellent find,"Stayed at the Corinthia for 3 nights with family after researching it on this site. The customer service is excellent- had some requests which were dealt with promptly by email even before we arrived. Rooms were great, the beds were the best hotel beds I've slept on!.Breakfast was excellent.The hotel is a bit away from the city centre but getting there by the pleasantly cheap metro was easy. The restaurants were too pricey for us as we were on a budget, and there is a lack of good eating places in the area-one or two nearby. These  do not detract from the 5 star experience we had here. Would definitely stay again. Well done Corinthia Lisboa-do keep up the good work. J Nair"
Apr 2015,50,Problems sorted,"When we first arrived at the Corinthia we were pretty disappointed with the service - took us an age check in and the bags did not arrive despite several requests to bring them up. Eventually we went down to get them ourselves. I have to say how impressed I was with the way this was all handled by the staff after we informed them of our concerns, though. We had a very pleasant stay after that. The hotel itself is very nice - I would completely recommend the Executive lounge - totally worth the 50Euros per room per day if you like wine or beer - the finger food and breakfast in there is also great. One thing that really was annoying about the hotel though was the pool arrangements. You are not allowed in unless you wear a swimming cap - which you have to buy from them for €5 - I havnt worn one since school and I now remember how much I don't like them!Also just to note so you're not disappointed, despite advertising a hot tub as one of their amenities, you actually cannot go in it unless you pay €20 per person for 2 hours.... which as it turns out was well worth it because the Aqua Area really was tranquil and relaxing. Would stay here again if I went back to Lisbon."
Apr 2015,40,Very good indeed,"Not exactly the top notch hotel I did expected but it's excellent value for money! Easy to find hotel, from the airport you could use the subway or bus. Lovely spacious marble bathroom, albeit the bathtub was a bit shallow. Great option for music in bathroom, the volume control is near the toillet. Cozy, homey room, nicely appointed as well, very comfortable bed. Excellent cleanliness everywhere. Poor soundproofing - unfortunately we heard the noise of every single airplane, descending or ascending  (could have made a timetable) and the banging doors of every room and my favorite sound of luggage wheels early in the morning. Centrally controlled air conditioning, even there was in-room control (I wasted some time trying to figure it out), it's a bit annoying, but the temperature was ok. Sweating window frames, we found little puddles every morning. Didn't try the breakfast, but tried the dinner buffet (29,50 euro per person), not exactly worth the money. Not much salad varieties, some items ran out and nobody replace them, for example the sushi and the shrimps (I stayed in the restaurant about an hour and a half, so did the empty dishes). Good grilled meat, excellent grilled fish, good variety of cheese, but that was it. Surcharge for Spa. We tried the pool instead (don't forget your swimming hat, or you have to buy one at the entrance).  Pleasant water temperature, nice pool, a bit small for a behemoth-sized hotel like Corinthia Lisbon, it wasn't crowded though. Despite of the large-sized pictogram clearly stated that the jumping is forbidden, there was some kids (and grown ups too) jumping and splashing, no staff around to tell them to stop, had to do that myself (not a pleasant moment). Anyway, it didn't spoil the pleasure. The lobby bar was nice and quiet, service a bit on the slow side. Useful concierge, helpful and polite. Fast check-in and check-out. There was a kettle in the room, but we were left without tea bags one day, and I found it out too late, and it wasn't a nice surprise, because I do like to have a cup of herbal tea before I go to bed. I guess just a lazy maid, the toiletries in bathroom weren't replaced also. I may sound a little picky, but the details make the difference, right? ... it's Corinthia after all. All other days the housekeeping was alright. Lifts needs you door pass to access, I liked that. Free wi-fi. Located a bit out of the way, but it's not a bad location at all - the metro station is around the corner (Sete Rios bus station also) and it takes minutes to get to the city centre. Bottom line: very good hotel with some minor flaws, excellent value for money, I would stay in it again (maybe would try the executive rooms and Spa)."
Apr 2015,40,A fine hotel but more for business as its in a poor location for walking tourists,"Before we set off for Lisbon the hotel emailed us an offer to upgrade from our standard room to an executive suite. We agreed but were then told it wasn't available- disappointing.However we were greeted well on arrival and had a 7th floor twin single-bed room. Very good in all aspects except the view. It's not great from any side of the hotelThe room is well cleaned and restocked every day and a large bottle of water is in the room and replenished as soon as it is opened.Good LCD TV in the room but why so few english spreaking chanels.   I thought we had a very old peace treaty with the Portuguese. Couldn't they find more than one entertainment channel in English.Beds are very comfortable and plenty of hot water at any time..The breakfast is too expensive for our taste, but walk out the door, turn right and you will find three or four cafes that serve breakfast at a more reasonable price.The evening meal in the hotel, if taken, is a buffet only with an a la carte menu on the side. The main focus of the buffet is the sushi starters or soup. Not great if you don't care for sushi, and only moderate to good in taste. The grill 2nd course is small portions of meat, chicken or fish, cooked, in our case , by a chef with no idea of rare cooking. It was all overdone The staff, however, are delightful, in the Tipico restaurant and in the hotel generally.The walk to the Marques de Pombal statue and park is a good 20-30 minutes, past the El Corte Ingles store - which gives you a good idea of the distance this business hotel is from anything but the zoo - which is only a few hundred metres awayLisbon is very hilly indeed. Good for aerobic exercise anyway - and easy to navigate to the few truly great sites.We used the Yellow Hop on Hop off bus that stops just outside the back door staircase of the hotel. Great to get to Belem. Good and cheap although for two stops we could not plug in our headphones as the bus was full to overflowing. They come every 15 minutes however.The Metro is a cinch. Four lines only in Lisbon all denoted by a colour. Our Metro stop is just across the road from the hotel's front entrance and to the left across the road. Our line is Linea Azul - the blue line.. Cheap as well, and bearing in mind our friendship with the Portuguese, most speak some English, so buying a ticket here or anywhere is Lisbon is easy.The food is very good almost anywhere in any restaurant, but watch out for the poor street cafes in the Baixa area. See what people are generally eating as you walk by, before sitting down in any of them -  Its always a game of chance.The Amorereiras shopping mall is well worth a visit and it has excellent shops on two large levels and a very adequate food court -  but try and eat lunch earlier than 12.30 pm as there are a lot of office workers using it as their local cafe and it is hard to find a seat when it gets busy around 1.00 pm"
Apr 2015,50,"Great Hotel, excellent service... enjoyable stay.","Great accommodations, but above all outstanding services… many 5 stars hotel should learn from The Corinthian Hotel in Lisbon.  Keep the great services, thank you. The only negative point maybe the location, slightly remote from the city center but very accessible city train or subway. ... Taxi can also be a good (and fairly cheap) alternative ..."
Apr 2015,40,Enjoyable & Relaxing Break,"Stayed here for 5 nights just before Easter and left feeling very relaxed.The hotel is conveniently located almost opposite the Jardim Zoologica metro stop which makes it very easy to get into the centre to see all of the main sites and to go to restaurants at night. The area is a bit lifeless but perfectly safe and there are a couple of very good restaurants a short cab ride away. The ones right by the hotel are a bit touristy so best avoided. Parc Eduardo is within walking distance and worth a visit if you have time. Staff at the hotel were all very attentive, friendly and well presented. The communal areas are nicely furnished and the bar has an outside terrace which although it doesn't have picturesque views is still pleasant for pre-dinner/post dinner drinks! Can't comment on the food as we ate out every night but the bar was fantastic. Room was a bit on the small side but comfortable. The Spa is fantastic and great value for money at 20 euros per head - we went twice and had it to ourselves. Highly recommend to unwind after a day sightseeing. Taxis are very cheap in Lisbon so don't be put off by the location. This is a very good value hotel and you can get wherever you need to very easily. Recommend jumping on the Metro from the airport as its only a 30 min ride and just 1 change."
Apr 2015,40,Not a 5 star,"I stayed at the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon early April during Easter Weekend (Wednesday-Sunday) with my Aunt and cousins. We were looking forward to a relaxing long weekend away to reenergize and see a few sights. When we first arrived at the hotel Wednesday evening, the bellman greeted us and took our luggage, and we went to check in. Check in took a long 45 minutes, but we were a group of 4 with 2 rooms, so we didn't say anything. We then went up to the room, to which we were greeted by an unflushed toilet in the bathroom of one of the rooms. Disgusted, we decided to leave the room & go for a swim, but soon realized our bags had not been brought up yet. Strange, but we assumed they were likely busy. We waited another 15 minutes and then called down to reception, making a special request to please bring our bags up. Another 30 minutes went by and we finally took matters into our own hands and went downstairs to get our bags ourselves. We put on our swimsuits and headed to the spa for a swim, which was soon another disappointment. It turns out that in order to use the hot tub/jacuzzi, you have to pay €20 per person for a 2 hour session. In order to use this hot tub, you also have to buy a €5 swim cap, otherwise you can't even go in the water. The pool is free but also requires the purchase of this €5 swim cap. Not a huge deal, but something I definitely wish I had known ahead of time. At this point we were pretty disappointed so I went downstairs to express my concerns to the hotel manager. Raquel handled the entire situation very professionally, and I really felt like she cared and was upset about our rough start to our 4 day stay. She continuously apologized and then went as far as to offer my entire family full access to the executive sky lounge for the rest of our stay, which was wonderful. Thank you, Raquel! We were also offered a free 2 hour session each in the hot tub. Once we had access to the sky lounge, the rest of our stay was wonderful. The only often confusing and frustrating part of the hotel was the elevator system. The keys often worked for the room and not the elevator or vice versa, and in order to go to any floor on the elevator you had to scan the card and select your floor outside of the elevator. This process often involved going to the desk to get a new key. Overall, nice stay, and I was very impressed with the executive club customer service. I hope that the hotel can improve their customer service for even non executive guests, which is the reason I would say this is not a 5 star hotel in my opinion."
Apr 2015,50,Luxury with 5 star service,"We have travelled and stayed in highly rated hotels, while on business or on holidays, in Europe, Asia, Far East and North America. We had to make several visits to Lisbon, Portugal over the last 12 months and we have been staying at Corinthia Lisbon on each of our visits. The striking thing is the level of service one finds in almost all areas of the hotel. When occasionally things have gone wrong, they have been put right by a simple call to the Guest Relations and one receives the service with due apology. This is what good hotel management is about. It is a remarkable achievement for a hotel which is one of the largest by the number of rooms and suites, in Lisbon.   Over the past few months the hotel has vastly improved the reception area as well as the beds in the bedrooms, which are most comfortable for a really sound sleep.  Breakfasts served in the Ground Floor and the Executive Club Room are excellent as one has the choice of a large menu. The hotel good eating facilities in its restaurants and bars.   The hotel has excellent facilities in its Health Club, though the services may be found to be somewhat pricey, particularly if one is interested in only one or two facilities, eg sauna. The hotel management welcomes constructive suggestions for improvement of its services. Ms Sandra Abrantes as the Head of the Executive Club rooms and suites is not only very approachable but makes sure that the guests' requests are attended to on a timely basis.  The hotel management at the top level has to be complemented for running such a friendly, welcoming and efficient hotel and we strongly recommend guests to choose this truly 5 star hotel and see for themselves what it offers.Mohammed and Maria Rosalia Tariq"
Apr 2015,50,Excellent Stay in Lisbon,"this is our second visit to the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon.  It was an excellent experience.  We were on the 18th floor and the view was amazing.  We were could see the aquaduct the bridge and the Jesus Christ Statue on the other side of the river.  Front of house staff were excellent, so professional and helpful.  The standards within the hotel are excellent, very modern, very stylish.  The bedrooms very comfortable with all the necessities.  The pool and sun loungers were very comfortable and we were very lucky with the weather with good temperatures for March.For a hotel of this quality and cost is amazing, will definitely go back."
Apr 2015,50,Excellent hotel!,"My family and I returned from 6 nights at this hotel on our first trip to Portugal. The hotel is lovely, with a modern and stylish lobby, large and clean rooms, helpful staff and excellent food.We stayed in a junior suite, which was perfect for us and our daughter.  The room was spacious and clean. Staff was prompt and courteous.  The buffet breakfast was included in the room rate. It was hands-down the best hotel breakfast I have had. The large crowd each morning is evidence of its popularity!  We ate dinner at the hotel twice and the inclusive meal is worth the 30 euros, which includes 3 courses and a glass of wine. My daughter and I had late afternoon snacks at the outdoor cafe/bar and it was fabulous.The hotel is well-located, convenient to the Metro and also walkable to downtown if you are up for the hills.  The fitness center is part of a chain and is clean, large, and has attentive staff. The indoor pool and adjacent sundeck is perfect to wind down after a day of sightseeing.  Definitely recommend for vacationers and travelers alike!!!"
Apr 2015,50,Superb place to stay,"An excellent hotel for both business and pleasure.  The junior suite with its stunning views on the high floors is well worth paying the extra for.  We did not bother with the exec package but used the money we saved to pay for the spar and the meals. the staff were excellent, very helpful and prompt when you needed them to be.  On the map the hotel is a little way out of downtown Lisbon.  However the Metro station is only 2 mins away and the journey is only 10 mins to the centre. It also means that the hotel is quiet at night.   All in all superb.  The only gripe - they need more weights equipment in the Gym."
Apr 2015,40,Great Business Hotel,"I recently stayed here for a week for a company conference. The rooms are clean and pleasant with views over Lisbon. The staff were extremely polite, helpful and efficient. There are a couple of restaurants and whilst the breakfast and lunch choice was very good the evening meals were a little dull. Not bad just nothing exciting. The only other downside to the hotel is the location. It is fine if you are just there for business, but otherwise there is not a lot in the immediate vicinity. Having said that, the Metro is close by and there are always plenty of taxis outside. It is also only about 15-20 minutes to the airport in light traffic."
Apr 2015,50,Comfort for all,"Excellent choice for a vacation in Lisbon. Three to four metro stations to the center. The rooms are spacious and spotless, generously provided with all the amenities. Breakfast is abundant and the service is professional and fast. Go for it."
Apr 2015,50,Excellent Hotel.,We stayed at this hotel for 2 days on 27th March and our sray was most comfortable. The junior suites were very spacious and the view from the window was super. Very convenient and extremely close to the metro station as well as the bus stop.The breakfast was very elaborate and the stuff made fresh was delicious.Overall our stay was 10/10 and the hotel is highly recommended.
Mar 2015,50,Superb!,"Stayed here with friends for 2 nights.Location is excellent, just adjacent to a Metro and train station. Famous zoological gardens are walking distance. Taxis are available in hotel parking 24 hours. We booked Junior Suites on higher floors and it was a real 5-star experience. View from the ceiling to floor windows was just beautiful. Suites were very spacious with all amenities available. Beds super-comfortable. Good number of electric lights with bedside controls. Tea and coffee facilities in room. Bathroom was very good and spacious with multi-channel music. Shower was the best part.Reception staff very helpful and courteous. They guided us to the places on multiple occasions,Buffet breakfast is excellent with anything that you can think of for breakfast. Service is excellent too.A heated pool on 2nd floor and gym add to the charm of hotel.Only downside is that there are no bedside electric outlets to charge mobile devices."
Mar 2015,50,Super hotel,"We got a free upgrade. Everything was super: room, facilities (we used the fitness and swimming pool) and especially the staff. The hotel is out of the center, but very nearby is the subway. Walking distance to the beautiful Gulbenkian Museum."
Mar 2015,50,Optimal choice,I stayed in this hotel for five days. There was a promotion - I got suite for very cheap price. Suite was very big. Bed and pillows were perfect. Breakfast is not very rich but quite nice. Staff is amazing. I forgot my head speakers in the room. They are very expensive - next day they returned me it without problems. So strong recommendation.
Mar 2015,50,Excellent..Hospitality Perfection,"We have been here twice in the past 3 months and find it the most professional and friendly hotel we have ever stayed in. So much so, that during our recent visit we booked our next stay!The Corinthia Hotel in Lisbon prides itself on excellent service.  This is want you will get..and this is achieved. All areas of the hotel from Concerige to housekeeping excel in every aspect. Rogue (doorman) is there to help you with your bags on arrival!  With his friendly smile and relaxing approach instantly makes you feel special!We checked in with the executive club, again, perfect service.  Executive rooms comes with access to the Sky Lounge, where breakfast is served and all day snacks and complimentry drinks.  Special mention has to go to Daniel, who anticipates your every need and delivers with such pleasure. Marta, Rute, Lillia, Monica, Margarida & Ruth who welcomed us each day to the Sky Lounge as well as advising us on the sights of Lisbon. Again, such a team would be the envy of many a hotel. We had a suite on 21st floor, and each day arrived back to find the housekeeping team had cleaned, and serviced our room professionally and with special touches that made our stay more memorable. The food in The Corinthia Hotel is of high quality.  It has a varied menu with buffet & Al a carte available from in the Tipico Restaurant, or a simpler bar menu if required in the Tempus Lounge. We sampled both while we were there and were as ever served with friendly professionalism. Special thanks to Vanessa and Gabriella in the Tipico for such excellent service. We cannot fault this hotel at all.  We would recommend you stay here and test for yourself.  It must be a rarity to find such a team of dedicated, professional and caring staff all in one hotel - how proud the Management Team must be to have created such a ""perfect"" team. Last but by no means least..Sandra who manages the Executive Club and Guest Services. The epitome of exceptional service.  Looking forward immensely to our next trip.Congratulations Corinthia, your standard of service is sublime."
Mar 2015,40,Excellent executive club,"We spent 5 nights in an executive queen room on the 22nd floor of the hotel.  All in all we enjoyed our stay very much and the price quality ratio was excellent. The best part of our stay was definitively the executive club where we could enjoy breakfast and afternoon/evening drinks in a very relaxed and peaceful atmosphere and of course enjoy the fabulous view over the city. The club was never crowded and the personnel were always very friendly and ready to help.The room itself was a bit smallish and the storage space was very limited for 2 people. At times the room was also very hot and stuffy and it seemed like the air-conditioning was not on all the time. Another negative point was the wall to wall carpet which is never nice. The thing that annoys probably all women is that there is no electrical outlet near the mirror (it is on the opposite side of the bathroom door), so you are supposed to blow dry your hair besides the desk with no mirror or proper lightning. So bring your own mirror or your own blow dryer with extra long cord (2 m). The breakfast at the executive club did not have the widest selection, but everything that was served was very good. My husband said that the bacon was the best he has ever gotten. We also enjoyed the fresh fruits that were peeled off and sliced. The coffee was also very good and plentiful. The waiters always left a full pot on the table after pouring you a cup from another pot. And of course there is no better way to start your day when you are on vacation than enjoying a glass of sparkling wine.One night we ate the buffet at the hotel’s Tipico restaurant. The cold buffet and the dessert table were very good, but the hot buffet was mediocre and not worth the price (30 euros per person). The wines were also very expensive as can be expected in a 5 star hotel. The hotel’s location is pretty ideal because it is close to the airport and the metro station which is almost on the other side of the street if you come out of the right exit. When arriving from down town with metro go to the same direction from where the metro came from and then after the gates go down one flight of stairs and then up 2 flights and then go around the steps that lead to the Sete Rios station. When you exit from that door you will see Corinthia hotel on the other side of the street.  However the metro stations have a lot of steps and not so many escalators so if you have a lot of luggage or heavy luggage, take a taxi from the airport. It will cost 15 euros including the luggage fees."
Mar 2015,50,Really a 5 stars hotel!,"It was our HonneyMoon and we chose the right hotel!Great comfort and helpfull staff.The facilities are amazing, pool, gym and spa, although there is a cost for the spa.And there was a champagne with strawberries in our room!"
Mar 2015,50,Treat Yourself,Brilliant hotel modern clean wonderful service well situated with great views of the Aquaduct & Road Rail suspension bridge.We stayed in March 2015 we were given the option to upgrade to junior executive suit. We took this offer up it was well worth the money.You get access  the Sky Bar on the 24th Floor where breakfast is served from 0700 to 1100 with a fantastic selection of food & chefs on hand to take your order.Then during the day up until 2200 you can pop up to sample free nibbles & drinks.A great hotel worthy of its 5 star rating we will be booking this hotel again
Mar 2015,50,Upgrade to a suite,We booked this as a group of friends who were visiting Lisbon and nearby Sintra. We had just booked ordinary rooms and just before we left we were emailed to see if we wanted to upgrade to a suite with complimentary use of the sky bar.We all decided to do it and it was fabulous. The rooms were spacious with fabulous views very close to Sete Rios railway station.The sky bar was a great way to meet up in the evenings with complimentary food and drink and very professional and attentive staff.Would love to have stayed for longer and will definetly return
Mar 2015,40,Convenient and Comfortable,"We stayed for 4 nights in a junior suite on the 13th floor.The room was comfortable and spacious although we did not have a city view the outlook was o.k.The bathroom was clean with a toilet,bidet double sinks and a bath with a shower.There was a good selection of food at breakfast.We had a buffet meal in the Tipico restaurant one evening fair choice and pleasant service.We used public transport to get about it was easy,Would stay there again."
Mar 2015,50,Fabolous Hotel,"Don't even think about it!!!! BOOK this hotel Everything about it is fabulous. The location is great as it is just across from the Metro stop. You can get anywhere. All of the service is special. They really make you feel special. The room is clean ,spacious and fabulous. We booked the executive floor and totally worth the extra money. Breakfast is delicious and afternoon snacks and wine are good too. I needed ice for my knee and with in minutes they brought an ice pack. The staff  in the restaurant at the executive floor are very helpful and caring. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it highly"
Mar 2015,40,City Break,"A short walk from Sete Rios station, the Corinthia is well placed for a holiday in Lisbon.As we were staying for 7 nights we chose to upgrade to a junior suite. The room was spacious, well furnished and cleaned to a high standard.Hotel facilities were good, although as the weather was so sunny and so much to see in Lisbon we didn't manage to use the gym!Due to this being a large corporate hotel service at the reception desk could be slow.The breakfast service was always busy and it was rather disappointing that the hot food buffet was not as hot as it might have been!"
Mar 2015,50,"Great stay, great hotel","Just returned after spending five nights at the Corinthia in Lisbon; had a wonderful experience. We arrived around 10 a.m. after a red eye flight, so we were delighted when we were allowed to check in upon arrival. The staff was courteous and friendly at check in, and throughout our entire visit, patiently giving us directions, change and answering questions. Their polite demeanor remained intact even when my son and his girlfriend kept doing annoying things like leaving their phone off the hook (which automatically sets off a security alarm-take note), forgetting their room card and forgetting to remove the “do not disturb” sign for the maid never knew when she could clean up the room.We had two superior queen rooms (AKA a basic room) but it was large enough, very clean, the bathroom was lovely and the bed comfortable. The room also came with bathrobes and slippers, which was nice. Housekeeping was efficient and non-intrusive.My only complaints are that I found the pillows to be hard and difficult to sleep on, and the rooms were too hot and stuffy; the fan/coolers did not work well in either of our rooms. We ended up sleeping with the windows open, which helped (but you do have to contend with the noise of airplanes overhead from time to time). The place has a GREAT gym, which is important to me. It has high-end equipment (free weights and machines) and plenty of cardio options (treadmills, bikes, elliptical machines and even rowing machines -bonus!). The gym was never crowded. My son and his girlfriend used the pool every day and loved it (well, except for having to wear a bathing cap). It was very clean and a good temperature.Our room rate include breakfast daily. The breakfast buffet was the same every day, but it had so many options it was easy to change it up. The servers were polite and efficient. My only suggestion is making a possible to get your own coffee refills; you can sit a while trying to get a server’s attention for a top-up. There is self-serve tea and water and juice, so adding a similar self-service for coffee would be nice. I should add that I emailed the hotel about a week before our departure because I had a few questions, especially regarding getting a cab to the hotel because I had read some worrisome posts about not-so-ethical cab drivers. The hotel told me that the fare should be about $10 Euros and said if there were any issues when we arrived, to tell the doorman and he would speak to the driver. This put my mind at ease, and I am happy to report that in the end, we did not have any issues with being overcharged by cab drivers, but it was nice to know that if we did, the hotel was ready to assist us.Finally, if you are looking for a place to eat near the hotel, I recommend a place two doors down, Mia Casa, which has some of the best homemade pasta you will ever taste, and at a reasonable price (about $8 to $10). We went there twice."
Mar 2015,50,Exellent Value,"Stayed two nights on city break trip in comfy room on 6th floor. Spent most of the time in downtown with excellent access via metro system (station just 3 min walk around the corner). 35min to/from airport including one change, 10-20min to city centre, depend on venue.Nice Spa facilities (20 euro extra per person) but worth it... we had it all for our selves on Tuesday morning, steam room and sauna as well as whirlpool with range of different experiences.Access to swimming pool with nice warm water is included in room price. Wifi in guest room is also free of charge.We had our meals in the city, but restaurant and room service with decent meal options are available. There are few restaurants near by if hotel is not a first choice.I would definitely stay in Corinthia once in Lisbon - business or pleasure."
Mar 2015,50,Great personal service,The room I stayed in had great space and the staff were really pleasant and helpful . The food was great . The view on the 24th floor were spectacular. We enjoyed are stay and would love to com back . any body who's reading this to come to Lisbon choose this hotel
Mar 2015,50,Worth every penny!,"We really enjoyed our stay.Fabulous comfy Junior suite on 11th floor,superb breakfast selection,well equipped gym,restful spa(treatments pricey),great wifi,free newspaper online or in print.Cannot compliment the excellent staff highly enough,everyone wore a smile,nothing seemed too much trouble.Metro right outside and taxis on standby.One of the best I have been to and already long to revisit.Best wishes for continued success!"
Mar 2015,50,Excellent Value,"We stayed in an executive room on the 20th floor. Room was a reasonable size, good views of the city, large bathroom and Nespresso coffee machine. Executive privileges were nice extra, swift check in with port. Executive lounge was large and fairly quiet and offering free nibbles and drinks (wine, beer and soft drinks). Definitely worth the little extraBreakfast was a really good selection far better than in a lot of hotels despite eating in the exec lounge rather than the main breakfast area there was still a chef cooking fresh eggs, crepes etcLocation was good, not in the main tourist area but right by the metro which had you there in 10min. We travelled on it everywhere including late at night and had no issues.Staff were very attentive and always happy to help Only slight downside was the aircon never seemed to get overly cool, not a huge issue for March but not sure about the summerOverall a great stay and would definitely stay again if in Lisbon"
Mar 2015,50,Excellent!,"Amazing value for money will probably be the highlight but that doesnt mean any aspect of the hotel has been judged on a lower threshold. The service was excellent throughout, everyone everywhere had a smile, very welcoming and helpful. We arrived early and got checked in without any problem (and this really is a big deal having been to some other places). The room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was spacious with a nice shower. Quality toiletries were available and replaced with generosity. Breakfast had a very good variety and the quality was very good. Did not dine at the hotel apart from breakfast so unable to comment.It is at a distance from the centre but it wasnt a problem at all as the metro station is bang opposite and takes about 10 minutes to the centre.All in all an excellent stay. Will I return? Absolutely!!"
Mar 2015,50,Corinthia Hotel Lisbon met my expectations of an excellent hotel,"The check-in process was friendly and fluent. The elevators were funny: first you show your key card outside the elevator and choose your floor. Then you will be directed to elevator A,B,C or D. Inside the elevator you can only go to the selected floor(s), which are shown on a separate display. You cannot choose other floors than your own, expect lobby, pool etc.The room was nice and quiet and the scenery was nice over the city.Breakfast was very good with a lot of choices.The conference facilities were roomy and quiet. The air condition was not too effective.If you choose this hotel for your free time, the Jardim Zoológico subway station is quite close."
Mar 2015,50,Just a weekend stay!,It has been great! The staff is very helpful and the location is great! The bedroom was very clean and the bed was very comfortable.It also has a very good and secure car park.For sure will stay there again in a next time! :)
Mar 2015,40,"Modern area, nice and efficicient hotel.....","Very high building, four elevators, but often crowded so you have to wait for a long time during breakfast. Nice healthclub. The service on the terras is excellent and so is the attitude of the staff.I must say, really fine beds, never slept so good during four days in a hotel!!!!It pure business in this hotel, not so romantic (except with the right partner of course....)"
Mar 2015,50,Good hotel with all the amenities,"I really enjoyed my four night stay at the Corinthia. The first thing to know about the hotel is that it is not located in the tourist section of Lisbon. And I actually liked that. It's about 50 meters away from the Sete Rios train, bus and metro station which is a major hub. It's a good connection for trains to Sintra, Cascais and the Algarve. The blue line of the metro also runs here (Jardim Zoologico stop). Lisbon's metro system is easy, efficient and gives you a better perspective of typical Lisbon life. There's a few good restaurants within walking distance.The hotel has all the amenities -- it's modern with nice rooms and good sized bathrooms. There's a nice lounge area and the concierge service is helpful.  It's reasonably priced for all you get. I would stay here again without a doubt.As side trips from Lisbon, consider a day in Sintra and a day in Cascais (with a stop in the Belem area)."
Mar 2015,50,"Hotel Corinthia, Lisbon",We stayed during a business-meeting in this hotel. All the staff were very accommodating.All our requests were answered in a short time. The food was very tasty.It was a wonderful stay in this hotel.
Mar 2015,40,Very good,"Just a few minutes from the airport and with the excellent Metro just a few minutes, There are some good restaurants/cafes in the zone but downtown is the place to go.The hotel is very good, efficient and the rooms immaculate. My wife adds that the bed is in the toppest drawer. The staff are very helpful."
Mar 2015,50,Very good hotel!,"I will start with the positives as they far outweigh any negatives!This is a lovely hotel, it was clean and beautifully presented and on the whole the staff were both friendly and helpful and the service was good. The room we had (Junior Suite) was lovely and the bed was very comfortable.There was plenty of choice for breakfast and we thought the overall standard of the food provided was very good. On the one occasion we ate in the hotel restaurant (we went for the buffet rather than the Al la Carte) we were pretty satisfied with what was on offer in terms of choice and quality, although a better selection of fresh vegetables would have been nice. The pool area (which is free) was very nice with loungers and clean towels set out and although you have to pay to use the aqua centre it was all beautifully done and well worth the experience. There are also spa treatments available at various prices if you want to treat yourself. I had an Ayurvedic Massage which was divine! The hotel is a bit outside of the centre of the city but with a metro station a mere stones throw away we didn't find this much of a problem, the metro is relatively inexpensive and very easy to use. On the negative side, we were less than impressed with the standard of service from the waiting staff during breakfast. This is a big hotel with a lot of rooms and therefore guests and although there seemed to be a fair few staff waiting tables we did not find them to be very efficient. Breakfast is essentially self service but you still rely on the staff  to clear away the dirty crockery between courses and for things like coffee and clean cutlery . On a couple of occasions my partner had to ask for coffee more than once before it materialised and didn't get any at all one morning. We also found that once you had used your cutlery for one course the staff would clear it away but not replace it and you had to keep asking for more or pinch it off of another table. It would have been a good idea to have a supply handy for people to help themselves if they needed to! The only other complaint was that we found that during busy periods you had to wait a while for the lifts. There is one bank of four lifts and no stairs for guests to use, not that we could have used stairs up and down to our room on the 18th floor! On one occasion i was waiting a very long time for a lift from the 2nd floor back up to our room as every time a lift did arrive it was already full. Not sure the hotel could do much about this though!"
Mar 2015,50,Welcome break,"I will be honest and say that in my hunt for a Lisbon hotel i basically typed the destination into TripAdvisor and the Corinthia was one of the top couple of hotels mentioned.  As always you look for the catch, be it price? More than reasonable.Quality? Excellent.Service? Polite, professional and courteousI am yet to find it.  The stay was good, the weather fine, and everything from the bed to shower, to choice for breakfast was of a good standard.  They even make a good cocktail in the bar.The hotel is not in the dead centre of Lisbon, which is part of it's charm.  There are though, two metro stops nearby, and also a train station, so you can get anywhere, quickly and easily.As an additional note, it was my birthday while on this trip.  I had opened some cards in the morning and left them on the bedside table.  On returning back to my room later in the day, i was shocked and delighted to find a note from the hotel wishing me a happy birthday along with a cake, bottle of champagne and fresh water.I would happily revisit this hotel as well as Lisbon and likely look up the Corinthia hotels as well in the future."
Mar 2015,40,A well presented welcoming hotel,"My sister and I booked the Corinthia Hotel for 5 nights to use as a base for sight seeing in and around Lisbon. We used the Metro system to transfer from the airport as we had read on Trip Advisor that there was a station very close by. This worked very well and we used the Metro most days to go into and out of the city centre. It only took around 10 minutes to get to the tourist areas and was very cheap and easy to use. We found the staff very welcoming and friendly and always ready with a smile and a greeting.The room was very well equipped, clean and quiet. Our only problem was that we found the mattresses very hard but maybe that's just our preference! The buffet breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and well presented fresh food. The staff in the breakfast room were very polite and efficient.The highlight of our trip was the Yellow Bus full day trip to the Royal Palaces of Sintra. It was a fantastic day organised very well by our tour guide.We used a taxi to return to the airport which only took 10-15 minutes and was only 10 euros."
Mar 2015,50,Excellent,"My family had a great time during our stay, we spent three nights and my kids enjoyed the pool, I did enjoy the free breakfast, there are loads of variety to choose from. The hotel is neat and lovely, the staffs are great and very accommodating, the location is not too bad, just had to pay 15 euro to and from the airport, bus stop is just few steps away from the hotel. We got a good deal too as we got our accommodation half the price. We stayed there with other friends and they are as satisfied as we are, especially the kids who wanted to stay for more days. We then agreed as a group that we will be booking same hotel again on our next trip."
Mar 2015,40,"A little further from town, but worth the taxi trip!","We stay at the Corinthia in London and Lisbon didn’t disappoint. The hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff are welcoming and couldn’t do enough for us. We both have food allergies and the kitchen was super accommodating for both breakfast and late night room service (which as other allergy sufferers will know, Is fantastic!). We stayed in the executive suite, so enjoyed breakfast in the 24th Floor lounge each morning - the views are spectacular. The spa was great, and the indoor hydra pool was very relaxing. Overall another wonderful stay in the Corinthia brand - we will definitely be coming back on our next visit to Lisbon."
Mar 2015,50,Great hotel,"Having gone to Rome in February last year my friends I had high expectations for our trip to Lisbon... Staying at the Corinthia hotel was really nice, the spa/ pool area was our favorite part and wished we had more days to make the most of it. Staff were very helpful 99% of the time and they were very kind to offer free champagne and birthday cake at midnight on the last night of our stay to surprise 2 of our friends for their birthdays. One negative thing was most of the sockets in the rooms didnt work so we had to keep looking for one that did to charge our phones etc... All in all our stay at Corinthia was very pleasant. Location was also good and taxis are always available and a subway across the hotel very accessiblePs: the inclusive breakfast is something you shouldn't miss out on."
Mar 2015,50,Wonderful Spa Hotel in Lisbon,"This Hotel stood out for us for the quality of the accommodation, the wonderful Spa treatments and Aqua areas, the Junior Suite that was such a lovely place to spend time and relax, as well as the Staff who were so very polite and helpful. The whole experience is one I would very gladly repeat, and recommend to others. The price was also very reasonable indeed. There are really only two possible negatives: Breakfast service could be a little slow when busy, and the Hotel is not in the city centre (but it is very conveniently near the Metro and Railway line).The Hotel restaurant does a very good Buffet as well as A La Carte, and right opposite the Hotel is a simply superb Seafood Restaurant where the Lobster and Shellfish is wonderful if pricey!"
Mar 2015,50,A little far from the old town but absolutely worth it!,"What a beautiful hotel! The marble lobby, full of fresh flowers, with separate check in area for executive and suite guests, the elevators requiring your room card to access them ensuring no random people on the upper floors, the suites with double windows overlooking the city, enormous comfortable beds...all in all, definitely 5*The downsides? Breakfasts in the lobby restaurant were cold and unimaginative and it took around twenty minutes to get a cappuccino, although this was rectified when we realised that our suite gave us access to the breakfast room on the top floor...wonderful food, great views, and champagne for breakfast beats a cappuccino any day! Our suite was not clean to my standards but this was soon taken care of and a bottle of champagne and fresh flowers were presented by the hotel as an apology.  Beware the little old man in the lobby bar, he clearly needs to retire, very slow and miserable, and can't make a cocktail to save his life! Biggest let down was the spa, no free access for guests, ludicrously high access fee charged per hour and treatment prices higher than well known luxury spas in England!! The hotel is a little far from the centre and main shopping areas but the endless stream of taxis waiting out front is a useful and very cheap way of getting around!"
Mar 2015,40,Lovely hotel,"Hotel very good, with a lovely indoor pool. The room was well laid out and very quiet. Hotel staff were welcoming and efficient.  The buffet breakfast was extensive and generally good.  The airport is quite close, as is the metro station, with easy access into the city centre.  We made a great choice."
Mar 2015,30,Fair hotel but far from heart of city,Hotel that can accommodates a substantial amount of residents so you can expect it to be fairly crowded for big business events. This affects the service during some periods. However the food I'd good and staff are friendly.
Mar 2015,20,A mixed bag,"Spent two nights here I early March.  On some levels this was a really nice hotel that looked the part, marble floors, nice lighting, a good gym, great breakfast and a great room (junior suite) but it was let down in a couple of important areas that will stop me staying there again. The first is patchy customer service.  My room wasn't cleaned on my second day. When I got back to the hotel I phoned housekeeping to let them know and they said they would send someone.  I went to the gym, came back to the room, had a shower and still no housekeeping.  Every time someone makes a negative comment on this site the hotel respond by saying if you had raised this with us we could have sorted it out so I went to guest services to let them know - their response was to ask if I had put the do not disturb sign on the door. This inconsistency was mirrored by the two visits I had cause to make to reception - on the first occasion they couldn't have been more helpful, on the second I appeared to be an irritation.The second problem was the temperature of the rooms.  The air con doesn't work and the Handel has been removed from 3 of the 4 windows - the problem with the air con seemed to be well known as a regular guest was arguing for one of the rooms on the cool side of the hotel when I arrived.  So potentially a really nice hotel let down in a couple of areas.  For this type of hotel that is a serious mistake."
Mar 2015,50,First class in all ways,"This is an excellent property. Very clean, spacious rooms, and friendly staff.  It is close to the Metro and gives you an opportunity to get to old Lisbon without taking a taxi.  Breakfast was very good, although a little expensive.  Restaurant was also good.  Would recommend it to anyone staying in Lisbon."
Mar 2015,50,Posh Star,"We booked into the Corinthian the weekend of February 20th 2015.Having arrived early we dropped out bags and had a walk around the district, when we arrived at 2PM for check-in our room was not ready, the staff were really apologetic and offered us free drinks vouchers at the bar and we'd hardly had a sip when we were informed our room was ready.Our room (junior suite) was beautiful and huge in size, very clean and sheets were tidied up and changed twice during our 2 night stay.It is also a family friendly hotel and the buffet breakfast had everything you could think of."
Mar 2015,40,Good for what you pay,"I stayed here from the 27 feb- 2nd march. It's a 5 minute walk from the zoo But that's about the only tourist attraction it's close to. The metro is beside the zoo which will bring u to town, a taxi is about €10 to the tourist areas. Our hotel room was 716 (basic room) it was clean and had everything we needed but we found it to warm at night. The air conditioning blew hot air no matter what setting we used, we had to open the window at night which meant the planes woke us in the morning! The aqua/ spa area is €20 per person per visit. We really enjoyed it but thought it was a bit steep if u wanted to go everyday! All in all I wanted somewhere that was 5 star with a pool and good value which this was, but I would definitely stay more central if I go to lisbon again."
Mar 2015,50,Excellent Value,"This hotel has all the facilities for a great break.  It is not expensive and the quality is excellent.  The rooms are quiet and it is positioned near to the Metro, train station and motorways.  The hotel is quiet and close to the airport."
Mar 2015,50,Organization and pleasure,"Very nice place, good people and excellent restaurants!the hotel is very near to metro line and other points like Zoo.The stafff are very good.The rooms are very very silent during all periods.The rooms are well clenned every day !It is a very great place to stay!"
Feb 2015,40,"Friendly hotel, a bit out of town, good facilities","Here on a company conference so did not have the family with me and did not have time to try the spa  - though went and had a look - seemed very nice and not too crowded. For a company event the hotel was great, plenty of space, choice of decent (though not excellent) restaurants serving buffets, lots of available rooms and helpful staff. The concierge/guest events arranger was particularly good, recommending some tours that we could manage to squeeze into our limited time off. The open top bus tour runs from behind the hotel - quite convenient. If you want to go into town its a 10 min taxi ride so not very far, but walking round the hotel is not very interesting. Very bad weather during our stay and the room was a bit cold - but I suspect that is the same with a lot of Lisbon hotels, they are probably better prepared for good weather than bad. Nice place, would stay here on holiday break if the deal was good."
Feb 2015,50,5 nights in Lisbon,Great hotel friendly staff. Across the road from the Metro and a across the road from the Zoo which was great for my Daughter. Breakfast Buffet was lovely with any type of eggs made to order. Swimming Pool was great although you have to wear Swimming Caps all in all a great hotel in a good location.
Feb 2015,50,Excellent,"Looking forward to stay again in corinthia hotel overall it was Bravo!!!😍the foods was sumptuous,honest people,excellent spa, massage and staff,gym,nothing lost,clean surroundings,nice rooms,all accessible,I love the place,cleantoilets,kindly say thank you to Joann in spa,kind staff all is beautiful and wonderful,what I can say more but my husband want to visit again sometime in Lisbon hope to stay again in corinthia hotel thank you Lisboa"
Feb 2015,40,Good hotel,"The hotel is very nicely decorated with a good spa, pool and gym area. The breakfast is fantastic with lots of variety and good quality food. The room was slightly small, but clean and the bed and pillows were very nice and comfortable. The elevators were spacious and modern.The hotel staff was pleasant, specially the breakfast staff. Always with a smile.The hotel is near the Zoo, El Corte Ingles etc. Overall a good stay."
Feb 2015,40,Business Meeting February 2015,"Offered everything we needed. Good quality, excellent service, fine rooms.As we stayed only two and a half day, I cannot tell more about the surroundings. spent all the time inside the hotel which was no problem at all"
Feb 2015,50,great experience!,"I cannot find any faults at all with this hotel. It was a 5 star experience. The hotel is slightly outside city centre but the nearby metro station means you can be in the historic heart of the city in 10mins. When we arrived we were very pleased to be informed that as guests of the day we were being upgraded to an executive suite which also meant access to the executive lounge where complimentary snacks and beverages are served until 10pm each day.Our room was very clean and spacious. The spa facilities and leisure facilities were of a high standard with a very well equipped gym. As part of the guest of the day award, we were granted a complimentary access to the thermal spa facilities which was very welcome with its range of hot and cold experiences!Any staff I met in the hotel were very polite and helpful at all times. We had no complaints about  the quality of food at breakfast or in the restaurant on the ground floor in the evening! All in all i would definitelty recommend this hotel! The views of Lisbon from the top floor  were absolutely spectacular!"
Feb 2015,50,"Perfect hotel, location and the most amazing staff","An early arrival, at 10 am and the check in staff were more than willing to give us a room. From the moment we arrived at the door the hotel staff were so helpful, taking our bags in and a genuine feeling of welcoming us to the hotel as though we were old friends. The room was absolutely delightful, clean and quite beautiful. I have visited the Lisbon area before but this brief visit made me realise what lovely people the Portuguese are - genuine, warm and just lovely people. The hotel could not have done more for us, always smiling and helpful. The restaurant was amazing and I want to say a massive thank you to Dulce who worked in the restaurant, she was a darling, helpful, smiling and gave us so much advice on where we should go and what we should do on our brief visit. The buffet was delicious, fresh fish, fresh food and delightful service. We spent a few hours in the spa and it was such a lovely, calm and relaxing place to be for a couple of hours. From the moment we arrived until the early hours of Saturday morning that we left I cannot find a single fault in this hotel. I hope to return when the weather is a little bit warmer to meet the fantastic staff - who clearly love their work and the people who stay with them. Even using the business lounge for printing out our return tickets was something that made our stay perfect. Thank you so much for such personal attention and a lovely few days in Lisbon.AMAZING."
Feb 2015,50,What a fantastic hotel!,"After reading the reviews on this hotel, our decision was made. But did we enjoy it too?Dear me yes! We arrived very early (early flight), but were allowed to check in despite the time. That set the tone for us. We paid to upgrade to the executive rooms as it grants you access to the executive lounge (breakfast, snacks throughout the day, light evening buffet, drinks both alcoholic and non and lastly a relaxing environment with great views).The staff were extremely courteous and professional throughout our stay. Daniel in the Executive Lounge was a true gent who could not do enough for us. Joseph in the gym (fitness instructor) was also first rate. Both these gentlemen had great senses of humour and spoke perfect English. To be honest, it was quite embarrassing the level of English spoken here compared to our level of Portuguese.The room was spacious, clean and modern. The bathroom a good size and the view from our window was lovely.The Spa area was of the standard you would expect from a 5 star. We paid the 20euros each to visit their wellness suite, the actual name escapes me though. We were not convinced it was worth the money, but we enjoyed our time in there anyway.The food was fantastic. We ate in the executive lounge, the main restaurant and the bar area. All areas standard of cuisine was excellent. We also ate out on a couple of occasions, again, the food was of a good standard.Points to note: the lifts take a little getting used to. No buttons to press inside. It's all done via your room key and a pad before your lift arrives. You can't simply jump on an available lift that someone else has pinged. Taxis. We were charged 23 euros from the airport to the hotel, but only 10 euros for the return journey. Get a taxi that has a metre, not a bloke quoting a price.Metro. Fantastic access from the hotel. This hotel is not in the centre, but the metro is literally across the road. It is a bit fiddly to and from the airport via metro (bags and busy carriages), you also need to change lines. Taxi is easier, just heed my previous advice.I truly hope that if we visit Lisbon again, we stay here once more. You really won't be disappointed if you choose this hotel.Thank you to all of the staff for ensuring my wife and I had a memorable stay."
Feb 2015,40,Great service lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel - the staff couldn't do enough for us. I would like to be able to transport it to the centre of Lisbon, but the swimming pool was very welcome and we couldn't find any hotels in town with such good spa facilities."
Feb 2015,50,Great hotel on every way,"This is a superb hotel. Great service, good food, amazing spa ( second biggest hotel spa in Europe apparantly) and you can hop on the tourist sightseeing bus just outside. There's also a great local fish restaurant directly opposit. Not at al posh but great food"
Feb 2015,50,Very comfortable and convenient,"Our weekend break at the Corinthia was very good value.  Our room was spacious and clean, with a lovely view (we were on the 19th floor), and we could open the window for fresh air.  The pool is a nice size (just about 15m corner to corner) set in an attractive room with plenty of natural light.   The gym has very good equipment (I only used the treadmill but it was very easy to use).If you come from the airport, take the metro red line to San Sebastian, and change onto the blue line to Jardim Zoologico.  That's very fast and cheap.  If you are late or have lots of luggage, take a taxi but beware of unscrupulous drivers.  The fare including airport surcharge and baggage shouldn't be more than about 15 euros, even in bad traffic (our driver took a very scenic route, then hastily turned off the meter and said the fare was 35 euros!  Luckily we had been before and knew what it should be).If you don't want to pay for the in-room expensive water, there are plenty of little grocery shops nearby that stay open late.  There's also a little supermarket in Sete Rios station.  And similarly, if you only want a coffee and croissant for breakfast, there are many little cafes within just a few steps of the hotel.This is a very comfortable and convenient hotel, with friendly staff and good standards of hygiene.  I really enjoyed my stay here."
Feb 2015,50,Recommended,"If you're looking for a hotel in the city center, this is not the one.  The hotel is situated in a (safe) suburb area, with lot's of other apartments in the neighborhood.However,  metro is just across the street, and takes you to the site center in 15 minutes.Price/quality ratio is very good.  We've booked an executive room, and, as mentioned several times here, found that this really is worth the extra money (in contrast to a lot of other hotels).  We arrived around 10, our room wasn't ready (which is normal).  However, we were given access to the 24th floor, which hosts the executive room.  To our surprise, they offered us a free breakfast.  Never expected that, but these are the kind of things that make a hotel stand out.Our 9 year old loved the fact that he could go to the 24th floor anytime to have a drink and some snacks.  Overall, the hotel was excellent.  Perfect free Wifi, small chocolates every time they saw our little son, spa treatments were very good.Only small negative is that they seem to have an issue in keeping the hot food hot, both at breakfast (bacon), and in the buffet restaurant (vegetables, lasagna, ...).  But, as said, overall, we were very happy with our stay, and will certainly recommend this hotel."
Feb 2015,40,almost there,"I really wish that I could give this hotel 5 stars. The rooms are great and very clean, the amenities great. The only thing that really  let it down this time was the fact that we had booked the room with 'a make a wish package' which basically gave us a few freebies. Great you'd think, but not quite so great when you had to ask the reception staff for the details, and then felt quite small when they were grudgingly given.  One of the 'perks' was 10% off of restaurant and bar food, and  we ate in the hotels restaurant Tipico (see my review of this) however on checking the bill the next morning this hadn't been accounted for so we had to wait while discussions were held and the bill adjusted.  Leaves a bad taste I'm afraid. If you are going to offer packages then at least have the grace to offer them to the client without them having to virtually beg. The hotel itself is very good and great that there are always taxis outside. The breakfast was good although the coffee was quite undrinkable, which is very strange in Portugal. Plenty of alternatives though."
Feb 2015,50,great,"we stayed on the 19th floor view from the room was great, very nice staff, very clean , close distance to the subway, bus station, train, enjoyed swimming pool, nice surprise in my room for my birthday, highly recommended"
Feb 2015,50,Fabulous hotel,"We were so pleased we chose this hotel for our mini break. Firstly, it was easy to drive to by car and you can park in the private car park for 18 euros a day - maybe a bit pricy but it was worth it to us. We had booked an executive room so we had a dedicated check in desk. One small thing was that although we arrived later than they recommended our room wasn't ready. The receptionist personally escorted us up to the executive lounge on the top floor to wait and we were able to help ourselves to the free drinks and buffet there. This place was amazing - food and booze available all day long and a fabulous view of the city - well worth the extra for an executive room. For the two days we were there we virtually had the place to ourselves.After dumping our bag in our room we went out to explore Lisbon before returning in the early evening for a glass of wine and nibbles in the executive lounge. Unfortunately we ate rather more there than we expected as there was a small hot buffet there so we weren't starving when we went out to eat. On the recommendation of the receptionist we went to the restaurant next door, the Alfassador (see my review of this place).Breakfast the next morning was again taken in the executive lounge and the choices were phenomenal - even a chef to cook you an omelette or fried eggs if you wanted. As well as that there was coffee, tea, fruit, juices, cereals, cheeses, ham, fish, breads/toast, and a hot buffet of bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, beans and tomatoes and there was even champagne for a Bucks Fizz if you wanted. Needless to say we didn't need lunch!On our second evening, after a sneaky visit to the lounge again for pre dinner drinks, we settled for the main restaurant in the hotel, Tipico. We didn't want 3 courses so we settled for the hot buffet for 15 euros a head but we could have had access to the salad bar for 10 euros and to the dessert bar for 8 euros. For the 15 euros we could go and help ourselves to as much as we wanted and keep going back if we wished. If only I had had the room! The service here, as in the rest of the hotel, was superb and very attentive. Perhaps we were lucky as the hotel was far from full, but from reading other reviews it seems that some have complained about the slowness of the waiting staff. No complaints here.Our only complaint around the room was that it was too hot and no amount of fiddling with the temperature gauge could rectify it. In the end we opened the window.All in all we had a great stay. Thank you to all at the hotel - hopefully we will return."
Feb 2015,50,5-star short break. Highly recommended hotel,"This has everything you'd expect from a modern 5-star business hotel extending itself to off-season holiday guests; friendly and knowledgeable staff, tasteful, clean and well appointed decor, full amenities including pool and gym and a very good breakfast available from very early until 11am. My visit was not one of business, but a well-priced flight and hotel holiday from British Airways. We arrived mid-morning, so the hotel was only a ten minute max taxi journey from Lisbon Airport We were well received and found the junior suite I had reserved to be spotless, spacious, comfortable and tastefully furnished (new), complete with functional desk, settee, chaise-longue, absolutely huge bed and a fully-marbled bathroom with double sinks. Everything worked.The mini-bar was fully stocked and tea and coffee available with kettle and tray. Toiletry niceities such as sewing kit, vanity kit, nail files, fresh bottled water and welcoming chocolates daily reflected the 5-star status. Free wi-fi includes an app which allows you to download a huge array of magazines and newspapers of your choice to your phone or tablet free of charge. Breakfast (hot from 6am-11am and cold before) was one of quality produce and plentiful. My favourite was the omelette-made-to-order cooked right in front of your eyes. I never had any cause for complaint during my stay. The hotel is not a 'city centre' location, but across the road from the hotel less than 100m is the metro and train station. From here it's 5 stops (10 mins) to the city centre. Also close by is the city zoo and the Gulbenkian museum."
Feb 2015,40,"Well done, perhaps overdone","While it fit our needs perfectly literally across the street from Sete Rios  (bus, train, Metro) station, and was well priced in the off season, it was a bit too anxious to sell us the extras. First I should say that at €75 a night for a 5 star place, I am hesitant to grouse. The bed was comfy, great shower(though the tub is a bit slippery), and generally nice aamenities. Reception and concierge were friendly and helpful. Housekeeping did a nice job. The room servoce menu was tempting and fairly priced. So why am I equivocating? To get to the pool and gym which are very nice, you have to go through reception for the spa. And if you want to use the sauna or whitlpool (which have some very nice added features like apres sauna snow) it's  €20 for a 2 hour pass. I would have otherwise taken a swim, but not want to feel like I had to pass inspection to do so."
Feb 2015,30,Mixed opinion,"First impressions aren't good here. The check-in process is long and tiring, especially if you've been travelling for a long time. The lady on reception tried to upsell me several things, even though I said I just wanted to check in and get to my room. She also kept pausing after saying 'Mr' to go and check the computer for my name again which I felt was quite rude. She could have just not said Mr X at all and I wouldn't have minded.The car park barrier wouldn't open so a kind workman had to call reception to get it to open for me. The lift to the reception from the car park is not signed so I struggled with cases up and down the ramp twice before finding the door. Hotel staff saw but didn't offer to help.I accepted the upgrade to a junior suite and breakfast at 40eur additional fee. The room was spacious and adequate with a good view. There was no noise to be heard from other rooms either which was good. Everything in the room looked pretty clean.The bottle of water in the room (normally complementary in good hotels) had a price tag hanging on it which I felt was a cheap trick and certainly not very hospitable. The breakfast was good with a large selection and no pressure by the staff to sit in a particular place which I appreciated. The man on the guest services was helpful and gave us a free guide.It was ok for a night but probably wouldn't stay here again just because of the bad first impressions."
Feb 2015,50,Portugal vacay,"We were so happy with the service here, the gourmet restsurant we enjoyed a delicious white wine, metro station just outside the hothel, easy access to the airport and close to city tour buses, concierge services for tour trips"
Feb 2015,50,Perfect place for business meeting,"I have been at the Corinthia Hotel Lisbon for a week conference and meeting and should say that they diserve the ""World Travel Awards - Portugal’s Leading Business Hotel 2014"" they received.  Very good facilities, room, food, service, etc.  All staff speak english and very professional.  Not far from downtown (approx. 6 euros by taxi).  I warmly recommend."
Feb 2015,20,Not Up To Par This Time,"Another short trip to visit my clients in Lisbon.  This time there were several things that didn't go as expected.  The staff is always great, friendly and accommodating.  The air conditioning wasn't working in the room.  I told guest services, and nothing was done.  I saw that the thermostat had been tinkered with, but no improvement.  It was cooler in the hallway than in my room.  I told the front desk upon check-out."
Feb 2015,50,Most friendly hotel we've ever stayed in!,"Our first time in Lisbon, chose the Corinthia Hotel as we had stayed I. The London Corinthia a few times and knew the standard would be good.It was far behind good.  We were welcomed at reception by Marta who couldn't have been more helpful.  We were upgraded to an Executive Suite which was a lovely gesture and made our 7 night stay so comfortable. We had a seperate dining and living space with office area and a king size bedroom with bath and shower and an additional WC off the lounge area.  Rooms were as you'd expect from 5* hotel.  Housekeeping were excellent, no fault in the standards.  Each night we had a ""turn down"" service and again most welcome. With the executive rooms it comes with access to the Executive Louge on 24th floor with panoramic views of Lisbon.  Breakfast was served in there and cannot be faulted, everything to choose from. Pastries, fruit and yoghurt, cereals, bacon, egg, sausage and a chef to cook your preferred eggs or omelette of choice. Unlimited snacks all day with tea, coffee, beers, wines and juices. The staff on hand in exec lounge were also most helpful and friendly. Big mention to Sandra (guest services manager) she couldn't have been more helpful, she was on hand during our stay with copious amounts of information about Lisbon.Marta, Maragrida, Lilla, Rute and Daniel were very helpful too, and always there with a welcoming smile each morning and evening. We ate four nights of our stay in the Tipico Restaurant which offers a ""buffet Style"" menu or a la carte menu.  Good variety of fish and meats which were cooked to you liking, you then help yourself to the hot section of potatoes and vegetables. Full salad bar buffet too with sushi and a variety of hams and cheeses also to finish a dessert buffet. We certainly didn't go hungry. The bar was busy at times, but still atmospheric and with a live pianist was a lovely end of night cocktail opportunity. Corinthia Hotel in Lisbon is slightly out of the main city centre, but only 10minutes on the metro which is across the road.  Also buses pass the front of hotel into main shopping areas too and aerobus for airport transfers at €5. It's only €20 for a taxi tranfer to airport anyway. We will definitely be returning to Lisbon and the Corinthia hotel. There was nothing too small or too much trouble for the staff.  From housekeeping, concierge, reception, restaurant, bar, executive lounge and spa everyone made our stay very special and I thank you all for your hospitality."
Feb 2015,50,Excellent hotel,"This hotel is excellent.  From the moment you walk you can tell it is a very good hotel.  The lobby make a grand impression.We were upgraded to a room on the 21st floor and had access to the breakfast on the 24th floor, this was brilliant and we are so thankful to the staff for making this happen.The breakfast has everything and more than you could want and has excellent service.The room was beautiful and cleaned perfectly every day.The staff were helpful and informative and helped us to have a wonderful few days here.Easy access to the metro station, aerobus and the yellow bus tours, all within 5 minutes.  We did walk to the main centre as it was sunny on one of the days and this took about 50 minutes and was great to stop for photos along the way.All in all a fantastic hotel."
Jan 2015,50,Pleasantly surprised!,"The hotel is well maintained and the staff is customer focused. I traveled with my family (wife and 2 year old daughter) and the hotel did an excellent job making sure we had a pleasant stay.  There was initially a miscommunication hiccup with the reception staff during check-in which was quickly resolved by management, who took care of the issue with prompt and excellent service... The only drawback for those traveling to Lisbon for the first time is that the location is a bit of a ways from the main area...  so will def need to take public transport to get around... we used uber when going back and from the hotel and it was way cheaper and a much better experience than taking the taxis (don't recommend cabs here)...  i would definitely stay at this hotel again the next time i'm in lisbon."
Jan 2015,50,Best hotel I've ever stayed at!,The service was excellent. Rooms so so beautiful. View from the room. I will definitely be back . The breakfast was very good. Nice gym and swimming pool. Metro around the corner so you can be everywhere in 5min. 2 stations from BENFICA stadium.
Jan 2015,50,One of the best hotels,"Not just the hotel but even the experience of staying there was second to none. We absolutely loved the hotel, the room and the service. We were on a honeymoon and so they surprised us with a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in our room on a last evening ... it just shows how much they care for their guests and nothing matters more!"
Jan 2015,50,Very good hotel,"The hotel is near the Zoo (5min walking) and quite far from downtown Lisbon, but you have a metro station just around the corner. In 15 minutes you can reach the any part of the city.The service is very good and the receptionists are very kind. When we checked in, we got an upgrade to a junior suit because we were 2 adults with two children.The rooms are very good, large with a nice decoration and Free Wi-Fi access.Breakfast is delicious with a good product selection. There is also an indoor pool and a large fitness area just next to the SPA.The car parking is extra 18€ per day but there is plenty of space in the surroundings to park your car.I would highly recommend this hotel."
Jan 2015,50,Excellent choice!,"Spent there four nights during a business trip. Location is excellent (metro station 200 meters, a few stops and you're in the city center); El Corte Ingles is 1.3km away in walking distance. For those of you who like to do some running: there's a park nearby but you could also have a sightseeing run downtown to the river and back for ca. 11km. Very nice on a sunny Sunday morning. The gym is well-equipped (4 or 5 treadmills, at least 3 bikes, weights etc.) and the pool seems to be popular. The quality of the breakfast is excellent. Staff very friendly, nothing to complain about the room except a lack of working power supplies next to the bed (to charge your phone)."
Jan 2015,40,A welcoming stay during a company sales conference,"Was here for five nights for a company sales conference. The hotel was a 20 minute cab ride from the Lisbon airport. Check in was very efficient and friendly and they also provided an adapter for USA plugs. A very comfortable bed (king) provided five nights of quality sleep when not at a meeting or dinner function. The service level on all fronts was very good. The dining facilities were good with the Tipico restaurant being more upscale (better food), enjoyable and less crowded. Sete Colinas was a buffet which after a few days got old. Service from all staffers was great and doormen were very helpful in getting cabs and providing insight about the city. Our conference went very well as the venues, meeting space and meals were all spaced out well. The only down sides to the hotel were 1) outdated power charging options in the room and the need to always keep you room key in the wall slot which eliminated charging when you were out of the room, 2) a weird and slow elevator system where you scan your room key and then press your floor and then instructed which elevator is yours a, B, C or D (also no changing your mind once on). Overall a very nice stay in Lisbon."
Jan 2015,50,"Excellent service, high quality, professional staff!","Booked this hotel because I already visited the Corinthia hotel in Budapest, which I also very much enjoyed! The hotel is far from the city centre of Lisbon, but you have a metro station just around the corner. With in 15 minutes you are in the city centre. (not a downfall at all) Corinthia dignifies itself by an excellent service they give. From the moment you walk in the hotel you feel like a queen/king.  When we checked in, we got an upgrade to the executive club (they saw that we went to the Corinthia Budapast just the week before). So we booked a junior suite. ROOMS: The Junior suite was very large. We had asked for twin beds and they looked very nice. The room also provides a sitting area with a nice lounge, some chairs and a desk. They gave us complimentary “cakes de belem”, the local specialty. Very nice. You could very good see that they used high quality material for the rooms, the linen, the decoration, .. Very much appreciated by us.The en suite bathroom had a tub/shower, with marble material. In the room you had stunning views all over the city, because of the wall high windows. The first day I just sat by the window and studied everything. We had a room on the 15th floor (I guess) and I would prefer a room on a higher floor when possible. Ask also for a city view room. Interactive TV with a lot of channels. Free Wi-Fi access.BREAKFAST: Breakfast is very important when I visited a hotel. I could sit there for over an hour when I go the breakfast. The choice and variety of the buffet was very good. The chef cooking the eggs and waffles was very friendly and funny, so big congrats to him. However the atmosphere in the breakfast area was not very good. But the food was great! EXECUTIVE CLUB: This is an upgrade that you can book. You will have access to the top floor, which is the executive club area. Here you have all day long drinks and snacks at your disposal. People who pay extra for this service also have the opportunity to take breakfast with outstanding views over the city and if you are lucky the rising sun. I could recommend this service at the most! SPA: We also spent a afternoon in the SPA of the hotel. This hotel has without a doubt the best spa of Lisbon and maybe even from whole Portugal. They have a dozen of treatment rooms and pool with water circuit. Furthermore they also offer a sauna, hammam, hot tub.  The lady who is in charge of the spa/fitness is very professional and sweet. You can ask her everything. Lastly they also have a indoor pool and a large fitness area with professional guidance."
Jan 2015,50,"Lovely, lovely hotel",Stayed in Lisbon in December with husband and daughter. Shared a junior suite which was a good size for all of us. Room was lovely and very clean. Most impressive were the staff who couldn't do more for us - very friendly and helpful and made our stay feel extra special. Very good breakfast - couldn't really ask for more food!
Jan 2015,40,Very comfortable,travelling on business I was offered this hotel as a recommendation. It did not disappoint. Very friendly Staff at all contact points and thoroughly professional in there delivery. The rooms are well appointed and if I had room in my luggage for the mattress that would travel with me too!!. The best nights sleep I have had in a long time. Considerate housekeeping keep there movements and noise to a minimum and the gym is well equipped and manned by knowledgable and helpful staff.
Jan 2015,50,Wonderful Hotel,Just back from a 7 day city break in Lisbon and had a lovely stay at this Hotel. It is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. Could not fault it in any way. We stayed in a superior double on the 19th Floor.While the space was a little small it had everything in it and it was immaculately cleaned every day.The breakfast was top class with a great selection and an egg station where you could have your eggs whichever way you liked.Something the hotels in Ireland should do. Staff were very helpful and polite. Would recommend this Hotel highly.
Jan 2015,40,Not as expections,"Stay from 27-29 dec 14.booking direct to hotel but check in was more than one hours.bad system and unorganized check in counter.booked as junior suite room but receipt as superior room.and complicated situation.waiting for decision maker more than one hour.card for room and elevator trouble and seem the hotel staff didn't profesional, for 5 times trouble seem like that."
Jan 2015,40,Decent family stay,"Stayed in Lisbon for a weekend with the family and had 2 interconnecting rooms.  Breakfast was good. Price - quality was good.  Children could choose a movie to watch.  Porters were very nice and friendly.You must know that it is mainly a large hotel with a lot of business travellers.  We saw lots of couples around too.  Free wi-fi was good and easy to access.The only thing was that the bathroom sink was not draining and we had to take the stop out for it to drain.The rating was really 3.5 for me as some ""soft hospitality touches"" could have been better in the room. However, the location is just near the zoo so very convenient for families."
Jan 2015,50,Great hotel with an excellent service,We had a very nice stay at Christmas. We enjoyed the help we had from the Staff in the reception and Guest desk. Rooms were very good and the breakfast was excellent and the restaurant too.There is a Metro station near the hotel
Jan 2015,50,Highly professional staff,"I stayed 5 nights in this hotel with my husband. The hotel was very nicely decorated with excellent spa and pool area. I faced a small problem in my first day in the resturant for which the manager dealt with in a highly professional way making our stay very comfortable. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The executive club in the 24th floor is excellent with charming view of the city. The metro station is near the hotel, so the transportation to the old city was easy."
Jan 2015,50,Great hotel a little out of town.,"Stayed here for a conference. Room on 14 th floor. Lovely spacious room, no traffic noise and good views. Very clean, radio button in bathroom v convenient. Tv options in English limited to news or v old soaps. Breakfast great, staff friendly and helpful. Conference facilities good. A bit out of town - €8 taxi, but metro and buses nearby too!"
Jan 2015,30,Very average hotel,"Spent 4 nights at this hotel and based on tripadvisor decided to upgrade to executive floor. Had spacious junior suite on 22 floor with nice view of the aqueduct. The bed was fairly comfortable but the furniture was an odd mix of a sofa with iron chairs that looked like patio furniture. The bathroom was small with tub shower combo and weird music that could not be turned completely off. The hairdryer needed to be used in the main room so could not be used in front of the mirror. On a positive note room, the room was very clean with nice turn down service but worn out carpeting.      The club was large and spacious but the snack selection was very minimal with pretty much the same thing each day. There many sodas to choose but only cheap wine and beer at night. Surprisingly they did not offer port. The included breakfast was ok with pleasant service but nothing special. The club was nice to sit in at night but not sure it was worth the premium paid given the very limited food and beverage options.     The location of the hotel is not ideal for tourists as there are very few restaurants in the area. Cabs were always available and the metro is close but I would prefer something more centrally located.     I did try to use the pool but I was turned away as I did not have a swim cap!!  Could buy one for 5 euros but didn't see the point. I also was going to get a massage but was angered that access to the spa area was an extra 20 euro and not included with a massage so I skipped the treatment.     Overall it was a very average stay. Definitely not a 5 star property. It is a clean place and best suited for a business traveller."
Jan 2015,40,Located a bit from the city center,Had a meeting at the hotel and it was packed. The junior suite was fine but the bathroom had music that I couldn't turn off and the double sinks had no place to put toiletries. The lounge on the 24th floor was a lovely space to relax but the food choices were limited. The service staff were hard working.  I ordered room service one night and it was quick and the food was warm. It is near the metro
Jan 2015,50,Bliss,"First trip to Lisbon and this hotel. It will not be my last.  Going that extra bit and booking an executive room/suite makes all the holiday that much better.  From a Quiet breakfast on 24th floor with a view of the bridge and aquaduct with hills in background  planning your day  to the amenities in the room - just what the doctor ordered.  The restaurant at this hotel was very good and varied.  Preferred a la carte to buffet and all choices were superb.  Staff excellent and ready to help.Taxis are cheap in Lisbon and the trip to centre cost euro about Euro 8.   Hotel boasts a spa as well.   Ten minutes walk from hotel you will find el corte ingles and if get tired, no problemThere are taxis everywhere.    Thank you Corinthia. I will be back"
Jan 2015,50,lovely hotel,"stayed 1 night on return from Algarve , we had advised the hotel of my friends 40th birthday in advance, on arrival we had a cake and champagne in my friends room .compliments of the management, the staff were all very friendly and helpful, the rooms bright and airy..with windows that opened a little.The beds were extremley comfortable. The metro takes you into the city centre in a few minutes and if you dont want to eat in the hotels excellent restaurant, there are a number of cafes, restaurants and bistros in the immediate area. My only concern was that the hotel did not have an atm and i didnt really feel safe walking to a cash machine some distance up the road in the evening."
Jan 2015,50,Very nice stay,"Found a great deal online for this hotel - were a little nervous as it wasn't in the centre of town but there was no need to be. Metro station is just across the road and this gets you into town in 10 minutes, easy to use and safe. Airport bus also stops just outside (airport bus number 2) the hotel and picks up just around the corner so that is easy too.With regards to the hotel, really grand lobby, staff very friendly. Upgraded to a Junior Suite on the 17th floor overlooking the viaduct with the town in the distance - lovely view. Only cost and extra c£45 per night and gave us breakfast - massive room, really nice and total cost of room still below the alternatives we were looking at in town. We had complimentary water in the room - not sure if this was because we had a suite but the water that you were charged for was clearly labelled as such (in response to some of the posts complaining that they didn't know some water was chargeable!) As I said above, the room was really large and recently renovated, had tea and coffee making facilities and a minibar- very comfortable overall. Only slight gripe was that the bathroom suite was a little cheap looking but minor in the grand scheme of things.Breakfast was nice, good selection, some of the 'hot' buffet food - e.g bacon, sausages and rostis were often more on the 'cold' side but that might have been due to us eating late. Fresh omelettes and waffles cooked to order, good selection of fruit, cereals, tea and coffee - everything you need for a good start to the day.If you're happy with a 10 min metro ride into town, stay at the Corinthia, upgrade on a deal on arrival and you will have a great time."
