Oct 2020,30,Disappointing,"I was moved to this hotel as the one I had booked was closed for Covid 19. With it being 5 star I expected the best. Sadly, this hotel is more like a 3-star in terms of comfort and facilities.Here are the shortcomings:Two tiny outdoor pools with hardly any space to swim. So disappointing.Doors bang shut when guests come and go.They put me in a room with a balcony overlooking the car park. Needless to say I did not use the balcony!All guests during Covid put in same corridor meaning a lot of noise. Guests should have been spread out as hotel was almost empty.Thin walls in rooms meaning I was frequently disturbed by people in next room talking.Breakfast service was uncoordinated and inefficient. Breakfast was poor for a five-star establishment. Bread and croissants not fresh at all. Hot food mediocre. No menu so I had to guess regarding what was on offer. Orange juice was excellent. Coffee average.Kids allowed to run around, approach guests and scream during breakfast.Hole in towel.( See photo)You pay extra for everything. I could not use the indoor pool or spa because you pay extra for this! The original hotel I had booked (their sister hotel) would have allowed me to use the indoor pool facilities for free but in this place you pay extra for everything.Noise is someone dragging things along the floor every afternoon on floor 3. This disturbed me immensely in my room on floor 2.Shower facility in room was like that of a 2-star hotel. Just a shower in a bath that you stand in. Water pressure pretty poor.Room decor was acceptable but the curtains were hideous.It was October and the heating did not work in my room. A technician had to come to switch it on! Why was it not on in the first place?Positives:WiFi goodBBC1 availableEasy access to beachFairly genuine welcome on arrivalBed quite comfortableOrange juice good"
Oct 2020,50,Lovely Hotel,"Stunning hotel in an amazing location. All the staff were helpful and friendly and food was varied and delicious. The spa is wonderful also.It was very quiet which is a real shame however all staff were very attentive and friendly, and the hotel worked out ways to accommodate all needs even with certain areas closed. I just wish the pillows were bigger."
Sep 2020,50,Beautiful hotel,"This was our first holiday during the pandemic. We booked our holiday about 9 days before we left.Our flights we booked direct with Ryanair and the hotel through Expedia.We were able to get a direct flight from Aberdeen to Faro and the flight is just over 3 hours.What to expect at Aberdeen Airport.  At the time of writing this the only things that were open was Duty Free and The Tippling House restaurant. The airport felt very safe and there wasn't a lot of passengers going about even with two flights leaving at the same time.Our flight was about 80% full.  They are still serving food and drink on the plane.  You are not allowed to wait in line for the toilet.  You have to press your buzzer to let the air steward know that you need the toilet, they take a note of your seat number and let you know when the toilet is available.  Which worked well.At Faro Airport they will ask you take your mask off at passport control then you put it back on.  They never asked for the passenger locator form that we filled out. Getting through Faro airport was very quick we were out and cleared within 15 minutes.We took a taxi to the hotel which cost less than 50 euros.You can either turn left or right when you leave the hotel and there is plenty of restaurants, bars, pharmacy and supermarket.We stayed in room 108 which was clean, comfortable and spacious room which looked onto the beach.  In the room you given two bottles of water if you want more water then you can order it through room service.  There is a coffee machine.  There is also toilletories in the room.  You can also get your room cleaned daily.  We just hung the sign outside the room. There is a hairdryer in the room. Breakfast is served from 8am to 11am.  You are taken to your table and served a continental breakfast but you can also order a cooked breakfast.  The food was delicious.There is 3 swimming pools.  The sun beds are santized. You are given two cards when you check in to collect your towels at the pool.There is a pool bar where you can order food and drinks.People don't wear masks when there sun bathing but do wear them when there walking about.There is a steakhouse. We didn't eat here but we did enjoy watching the sunset here.There is the Atlantis restaurant which us located on the beach.  You can't charge anything to your room from this restaurant. But all other bars and restaurants you can charge to your room.We ate at this restaurant 3 nights in row.  The food was delicious.Also when you check in you are given a key card to access the beach.You can hire a sun lounger on the beach which cost 10 euros.The beach is beautiful. The beach is not sectioned off for social distancing and people are not wearing masks.I would recommend this hotel."
Sep 2020,50,Incredible hotel with perfect ocean views,A great hotel right by the beach. The outdoor pool is great and we loved the ocean views from our balcony over the ocean.The staff is extremely kind and always ready to help.We had dinner with friends at their Steakhouse and we truly loved it. Delicious food and the sunset views over the ocean was probably the highlight of our stay.Highly recommended hotel.
Sep 2020,50,Great stay by the beach,"We stayed at Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort for 2 nights and we love it! They have an amazing outside pool perfect to sunbathe and relax during those hot summer days. The beach is located right in front of the hotel and we could see it from our balcony. There's plenty of restaurants by the beach  but our favourite was the steakhouse restaurant located at the hotel. We had one of the best meals  ever, the meat was very tender and juicy and the chocolate caramel mousse was the simply amazing. We loved our time here  and we can't wait to be back again."
Sep 2020,50,Excellent Holiday,"We were moved to this hotel by our holiday company as our original one was not available for some reason.We were not disappointed. This hotel was excellent. On arrival we were allocated a ground floor room which i did not fancy and asked if we could have a higher floor, no problem as the staff at reception fixed it for us in minutes. All the staff took the Covid rules in a very professional manner so no worries here. Every one we came into contact with were very pleasant and nothing was too much trouble for anything we needed. A big thank you to them all.  I did like the idea of going for breakfast, sitting at your table and the staff fetch anything you want, Brilliant service, food was excellent. We did go to the beach club and found the private beach a big bonus. However just a bit of advice to newcomers you do have to pay for the sun beds. It costs 10 Euro for half a day or 20 Euro for a full day! Nice little earner if you have fifty beds!! All the staff again at the club were very efficient and friendly. Hotel is spotless which is a credit to all the staff involved. Thanks again."
Sep 2020,30,The closest to the beach you will get,"What I loved in this hotel was that it was really close to the beach with easy access if you have kids or elderly people traveling with you. If this is important for You, then this is the best hotel in all Algarve for it. All other hotels are more Distant to the beach or have lots of stairs to access the beach. Another great thing is that they serve food and drinks in the sand if you rent some chairs. The service and the food are just ok (don't expect a 5 star service), with little variety and everything is a little bit outdated (what is ok for me)."
Sep 2020,30,Hotel in good location but some issues. ,"We were in the self catering rooms which were a bit dated.  The hotel is in need of some renovation .Some issues with staff service  who appear to forget they work in a 5 Star hotel. I particularly did not like being told to get a towel myself from the other pool some distance away, when stocks were exhausted despite there being a phone beside this attendant. And having just walked from there as there were no sun beds. Not enough sun beds or towel placement control round the main pool at all. When numbers in the hotel declined this week beds were then removed making the situation no better. Room not cleaned on last day, yes mistakes can happen but we called at 6.0pm and were told an hour later a cleaner would attend while we were out. Returning at 11pm no room clean and had to call for fresh towels. Service in all bar areas slow and having to repeatedly ask for service, or bills is not good. Covid controls very good and all staff adhering. Health suite staff excellent. The hotel is in a great location but falling short of 5 star status unfortunately."
Sep 2020,50,Perfect break despite difficult times.,We are coming to the end of our week here. We felt anxious about travelling but needed a break. This is a quality hotel. We had a sea view room. Spacious and well equipped. The hotel is ideally positioned on the beach. Pool areas lovely. I also paid a small fee to enjoy the amazing spa pool- pre booked and only me there. We are on full board. The lunches by the sea are excellent particularly the fish and the breakfast and dinners in the restaurant also. I particularly wanted to post now to say how impressed we are by the hotels response to the current situation. The staff are meticulous in wearing masks and keeping everywhere and everything spotlessly clean and disinfected. We feel safe and will cared for. Thank you we hope to visit again when masks aren’t needed.
Aug 2020,20,Ok but the worst 5 star hotel I’ve visited ,"Slow expensive room service, rubbish cleaning and lots of excuses things were closed due to the dreaded. I’m sorry but at this price you expect a shower post check out and a decent cocktail. The staff were friendly but I’m sorry €12 for an sandwich on rubbish bread"
Jul 2020,40,Family holidays,"Very nice hotel with an excellent service in restaurants and bars. The rooms, in your case, the suite was clean only the air conditioning is from time to time no working very good. Pools are very nice also the beach is only a step away. The animation is very excellent."
Apr 2020,40,family holiday,recently visited this hotel. with location being key we loved it. private beach access & within walking distance to beautiful restaurants  The only disappointing factor about this holiday was of course the corona virus was hitting portugal & places were going into lockdownTo us where the hotel fell down was lack of information they started closing down the hotel bit by bit without notifying the guests. Rooms stopped being cleaned. Had to go to reception to replace towels & get toilet roll etc. Spa was closed kids club closed beach bar had reduced hours.As I said all of this was happening around us with no communication from Hotel Mgt. This is not what you would expect from a five star hotel. I work as a travel consultant and I would be very upset if I had sent clients to this hotel to be treated in this manner  Obviously all was done for the staff & guests welfare but communicate to your guests. We had travelled fm Ireland  Saturday to Saturday & by Wednesday we were.looking for flights to go home as the reception staff weren't able to tell us of the hotel was going into lockdown & if we would be able to stay till the end of our stay. We were travelling with 2 children so needed some reassurance which we never received. I would love to visit this.hotel again & for them to prove ot is a 5 star.
Apr 2020,50,Our 3rd Visit for winter holidays,"My Wife and myself along with two friend returned here in Febuary 2020 we stay in the aparments in the grounds of the hotel.Thanks to the hotel staff we have had apartmeny 591 on each visit,but slight problem with damp in bedroom wardropes,we did imform the hotel on our last visit,not a big problem we used wardrope in other room.Shower gel and hairdryer in bathroom,small kitchen great for self catering everything you nice even dressing gowns.We all enjoy walking so we are out most days the weather this year was reaaly hot for the time of year,hotel right on the beach,great beach bar over looking the bay.Lots of pools around between apartments and main pool is heated,beautiful paceful place,,we will return,,Enjoy the geordies"
Mar 2020,40,Holiday,Enjoyed our stay which was interrupted by ther coronavirus infection which caused us to not take tours and move about freely.  Since this has nothing to do with our stay at your holiday which was very enjoyable certainly would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a lovely place to stay while on vcacation.
Mar 2020,50,Great hotel but Virus shut most things down!,"We were part of a group package for a longstay in this splendid property. For the first two weeks we enjoyed the grounds, the fun shuttle to town, our wonderful self-catering apt, the fabulous beach, the pool, the views, the great staff at reception and the brilliant staff and ambience of the Atlantico where the female servers were so friendly and capable-thanks Sara and Loiza and all the rest.When the virus fears hit all of Europe, we were quickly left without. Tour Manager and service after service shut down( understandably). Going home was a series of missteps and changes. We wonder if the hotel might have communicated a little more and offered some special take-out options. To be fair, this was a new experience for all and our memories of thenhotel staff are very positive,"
Mar 2020,50,very nice stay in the resort,"very friendly people, many thanks for the big surprise you granted me at the occasion of my birthday one week after arrival, especially remarkable and very usefull is the shuttle-bus-service to New Town and Old Town"
Mar 2020,50,wonderful trip,"This hotel is lovely for staying on holiday, it's near the sea and very silent, for people who search a good service is it excellent, we will stay again in the next time, you must have a car, because the hotel is outside"
Mar 2020,50,Hard to please,"We spent 5 nights at out new home from home. Honestly Grande Real Santa Eulalia is a great hotel, excellent  location and with great facilities. Right on the beach and amazing pool area. My partner and I stayed in a sea view room with a terrace. We had breakfast every morning which was excellent value for money.Staff all very friendly and helpful. Rooms very clean and cleaners are in every day even on days we're we wanted to chill in our rooms they came later to clean. Towels are provided for the pool area so no need to bring towels with you. As someone who isn’t easily impressed. At first sight, my partner and I were impressed with how stunningly beautiful the resort was. But we’re both on reserve on a few things. I told him my initial impression was a 7 out of 10 and he was a little on the fence and scored his initial at 5. Within moments of going through our luggage and discovering missing items we soon increased our scores to 8 leaving room for improvement. From the moment we woke up the following morning to the day we checked out it was safe to say the scores remained a firm 9. We would’ve scored a 10 but I’m hoping to experience this on my next visit. Well done to the Amazing front of house team (who genuinely look like they enjoy their job and working with each other), cleaning ladies (who were always so friendly and said hello in the hallways) and lastly the breakfast team, two of which really stood out for us. Caita Mota and Mario Lurking made breakfast enjoyable every morning.  I took the time to personally take down their names as they were both consistently warm and engaging with us. I will most certainly be staying at this resort every time I visit Portugal."
Mar 2020,50,Wonderfully relaxed,"My husband and I booked this hotel through a tour operator as a last-minute bargain and what a bargain we got! It's a really lovely hotel. Staff are fantastic and nothing is too much trouble for them. We had a one-bed apartment on the grounds and it was very spacious and spotlessly clean. We booked breakfast only meal plan which was a full buffet. There is direct access to a beautiful, quiet beach. We were there at the beginning of March so it might not be quite so quiet during the summer period :-)"
Mar 2020,50,Luxurious and stress-free babymoon,"We visited early March. The weather was sunny and perfect, so we could enjoy the swimmingpools and the beach at the hotel. The hotel, appartments, pools and beach are all very beautiful and clean. It was low season, so we enjoyed a quiet stay without the mass tourism. All the employees were very friendly The appartment/studio was lovely, the beds very good."
Mar 2020,50,Amazing stay at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia,Amazing hotel with great quality of breakfast. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Rooms very clean and cleaners are in every day. Towels provided for the pool area so no need to bring towels with you. Overall a brilliant stay and cant wait to go back again!
Mar 2020,50,Lydia from Canada,Great location and facility. Right on the beach and amazing pool area. Easy access to historical excursions   Accessible to town with free bus service. Apartments and hotel rooms so meet the needs of family and singles. Great breakfast   Excellent value for money. Free parking and can walk to restaurants and grocery shopping out of complex. Stayed for 2 weeks and no complaints at all. Staff in all areas accommodating
Mar 2020,50,Five-Star Luxury in Abufeira,"The Grand Real St. Eulalia has a stunning beach location just east of the town, with great ambience and friendly, very professional staff. We stayed for the month of February in the self-catering apartment complex of two-story 'fisherman's houses' set in attractive, quiet laneways with their own pools and easy access to local restaurant and attractions. The hotel provides a full range of concierge services, and made excellent arrangements for tours, excursions and restaurant reservations. We had a wonderful month and can't wait to return!"
Mar 2020,50,Winter Sunshine,"Excellent stay with requested Seaview room without charge. Birthday celebration acknowledged with cake and bubbly delivered to room. Excellent breakfast choices staying on B and B option. Enjoyed evening meal also at extra charge at 29euro per person, nice for special occasion. Excellent direct beach access location. Overall Excellent value and would not hesitate to return another time."
Mar 2020,50,What a beautiful place!,"I felt welcome from the moment I walked in, my room got upgraded, which was also really really nice (though my suite was now so big I don't even think I used half of it!).Lovely location with a beautiful beach and quite a few pools!"
Mar 2020,50,Brilliant,"We had a great time here our little boy loved the heated outdoor pool and the playground area, the breakfast is phenomenal and their dinners are delicious too, would highly recommend staying here, we stayed here as a couple last year also so our return visit says it all, the staff are very friendly and welcoming and helpful"
Mar 2020,50,Excellent facility,"We thoroughly enjoyed our month at the Grand Eulália. Staff were always pleasant , polite and very helpful. Our apartment was excellent and very clean. Shuttle service was reliable and dependable. We would come back in a minute and will highly so we had our meals elsewhere. We would highly  recommend the facility to friends. The only complaint we have is the quality of the food at the hotel. We were not impressed but the food and service at the beach cafe was superb. Our vacation in Portugal and our stay at the Grand EULÁLIA was one of the best we have ever had. The entire facility is immaculate and service from all employees was prompt. Your employees are very polite and helpful . A wonderful experience for both of us.Jim and Joan Moore."
Mar 2020,50,Highly Recommended,"We stayed for 1 week as a newly wed holiday with my wife and our little son. The hotel has a great location in Albufeira, with a beautiful beach in front. You can reach the old town easily as they provide a free shuttle bus several times a day. Facilities and accommodation are very good.I can make 2 recommendations for improvement: our room had some walls cracked opposite the bath probably from old humidity. A new wall painting will lift its look. In the main restaurant during the dinner some of the foods are served in pots or pans. You have to lift the lids and so every guest will do so which is not hygienic. Moreover those lids you have to put somewhere around while you help yourself thus damaging the while covers around. The standard practice in restaurants of this class is to have warming tools with small flames underneath which should keep the pots warm but without the need for lids. Alternatively some staff serving from them. My sound minor but these days is a matter of hygiene Our trip was lovely and the staff worked hard every day. Thank you."
Mar 2020,40,Nice Hotel,"Very friendly staff, apartment was clean but could do with a little updating. As could the decking around the pools, would rate this 4* not 5*. I would return to this hotel again out of season. Could do with a few less steps down to the beach as this was difficult with a buggy. Was a bit of a walk to the nearest supermarket that’s open this time of year, all local restaurants were closed, would be good if this is mentioned and then maybe some better deals to include food with a room only booking, as this did turn a cheap stay into a more expensive one."
Mar 2020,50,"Excellent hotel,food and staff","Excellent service and quality,good food friendly and helpful staff very clean the rooms and the rest of the hotel the beach is cleaned regularly also the buss who takes you to albufeira is a very good idea I will definitely return and recommend the hotel AAA++++++"
Mar 2020,40,SHORT STAY,Hotel was clean and on the beach. No tea or coffee in room.Our room was a bit dated and in shade nearly all day. Bed was excellent size. A few extra touches needed before been a 5 star hotel.But all in all a good hotel and excellent beach location
Mar 2020,10,I wish I had known.,"Just going to do bullet points . . *Nothing much going on* No onsite shop , nearest 1 a good 15 minute walk , not good with a toddler* Beautiful views* beach nice* Staff at Atlantico Surely dont smile or even react to you .* Maids good , rooms cleaned daily* 15 minute walk to nearest civilisation * Rooms need updating,  good luck self catering dont even get any pans, but there was a hand blender !* beds quite hard * not many of the onsite restaurants open out of season."
Mar 2020,40,our family stay in santa eulalia,"we had a great stay, 6 days of sun shine (not very common for this time of year), we loved to have lunch at the beach bar, the Atlantico salad here is fabulous (fresh shrimps and great cocktail sauce). Also for the kids they have nice food options. Too bad that there is no indoor swimming pool available for kids (the one at the spa is only for adults). Outside there is one heated pool which is still a bit cold when the temperatures are around 18-20 degrees with wind. The girls had a great time though. The breakfast was also great, lots of choice, and fresh fruit (juice)! The chairs in the restaurant were not that comfortable and some were unstable. If you have doubts about where to go for dinner, ask the reception staff. We went to two of their suggestions and had a great experience and good food."
Mar 2020,30,Not a 5 Star,This is not a 5 star hotel. I spend around 120 to 130 nights a year in 4 and 5 star hotels all over the world so feel I am able to recognise a proper 5 star hotel.The rooms are a good size but need a refurb. Beds are very hard which may suit some people. They have a crazy system with tea and coffee in the rooms. You get a kettle and a few tea/coffee bags on arrival but no milk. Milk can be bought from the bar at 2 euros a small jug. Once you have used your tea / coffee bags you have to buy replacements !!!The breakfast selection is quite good but the hot items are never more than just warm. The evening buffet is overpriced at 29 euros per person and again the hot items were never more than luke warm.I suppose as a holiday hotel it is OK provided you did not spend too much on your room.It does offer a variety of sports facilities.
Mar 2020,30,NOT A REAL 5 STAR HOTEL,This 5 star hotel seems poorly maintaine. Poroblem with the air conditioning and refrigerator.in our room. No ice cube facility having to ask at the bar for ice cubes and get in a small glass instead of what it should be in a bucket for a 5 star hotel. Only one complementary bottle of water. Only 2 coffee packages in the room that are not replaced each day unless I pay; room not well cleaned until I complained. Bathroom sink a bit damaged. Elevators doors worn and seem dirty. ALL I ALL DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A 5 STAR HOTEL.
Mar 2020,50,Fabulous Hotel,"Thank you for a wonderful weekend spent looking at wedding venue. WE will be booking another stay very soon.Great location and beautiful facilities, Staff wonderful. Wedding planner gave great information. We have booked my sons wedding for May 2021."
Mar 2020,50,Wedding booking,Had a wonderful stay and was fully satisfied with services provided and like it so much we booked our wedding here. My partner and I took our parents here and every single one of us thoroughly enjoyed it.
Mar 2020,40,4 night stay,"Great hotel in lovely beach side location. Friendly efficient helpful staff, comfy beds. Too cold to swim in sea or unheated pools at this time of year, only one outdoor pool was heated and it was small. Would be better if another outdoor pool was also heated. Spa pool felt overpriced considering the temperature, it could have been much warmer.Otherwise a great stay!"
Mar 2020,50,Vantage beach location,"Great hotel for a relaxing break, good food, lovely front desk reception staff (very helpful), decent gym & amenities, not too far from restaurants & town centre, ample free parking. Would visit again"
Feb 2020,50,Great hotel for families with kids!,"The hotel has everything you need to keep your child entertained for a week. Staff were very kind and helpful. Albufeira itself is not the most beautiful town in Portugal, but the hotel has everything you need, and therefore you can have a great holiday just sticking to the area around the hotel."
Feb 2020,40,Fine,Please make the water in second piscine so warm as the other!Please be more clear about the price of coffee/thee/water in the room!Please show the prices of the restaurant on a brochure in the room.
Feb 2020,50,Excellent hotel,"Enjoyed a lovely week here during February half term with my 2 daughters and my mum. We had a one bedroom apartment with sofa bed in the lounge. The one bedroom apartments are all on the ground floor. I requested to be as close as possible to the main building as my mum has walking difficulties. This was honored and made a big difference to our stay. The site is huge so worth requesting this if needed. I agree with some of the other reviews that the decor is slightly dated, but this is only in style rather than state of repair. I personally loved the brightly decorated rooms. Who cares if it's not the latest style! The apartment was spotless and cleaned daily unless you put up the 'do not disturb'. It's not 5 star by UK standards but you are still comfortable in clean and pleasant surroundings and I had no complaints. We had a little patio with table and chairs and clothes airer. This overlooked the car park but the grounds are planted with such lovely trees and plants that it was no issue. We were able to watch little birds and other wildlife from our patio.All the staff we encountered were so pleasant and helpful and we felt very welcome. The breakfast is out of this world! So much choice and all so fresh and delicious! We didn't eat at the hotel at other times so can't comment on that. We enquired about the evening buffet but at €30 a head we gave it a miss! We ordered in takeaways through Uber Eats and Gato Gordo and I met them outside the main building. This worked well and were always delivered on time and with a smile. We also cooked in the apartment. All utensils were there but we could have done with a peeler! We noticed on the last day that the microwave was in fact a combi oven so we could've cooked more! If you want a supermarket with a decent amount of choice it's worth taking a taxi to the Albufeira shopping centre where there is a good sized supermarket. The Intermarché (about 15 minutes walk) was OK but a bit pricey. We used a lot of taxis due to my mum's mobility difficulties and found them all pretty reasonable (especially as there were 4 of us). All the taxi drivers were very pleasant and helpful. I sometimes used Uber which were very competitive but called Real Transfers (I think they are linked to the hotel) when I couldn't get online. The pool and beach were both lovely. The heated pool was just about an acceptable temperature for maximum half an hour (February) before feeling chilly. The other pools are not heated. The beach is beautiful. Nice soft and clean sand and great views. Towels are provided for pool and beach use so no need to pack any! I wish I'd known that before bringing loads!It is rare that I return to the same holiday accommodation but I would definitely return to the Grande Real Santa Eulalia. Gorgeous holiday!"
Feb 2020,40,Beautiful location,"We stayed in an apartment close to the hotel. It was very spacious and had all the amenities we needed - 2 bedrooms, 2 bath, kitchenette. Shuttle into town a few times a day.Food was adequate, but found to be pricey compared to the quality and selection you can get in town. All staff were friendly and sincere - very helpful and relatively prompt service. I had 2 teen boys with me. It would have been nice for them to have a games room or sports equipment, but we were only there for a few days and they enjoyed exploring the beach. We also did the surf lessons through a private company organised by the hotel - and this was amazing. Totally worth it and more beautiful beaches. Trip exceeded my expectations!"
Feb 2020,50,"Paul from Stratford, Ontario",Excellent Hotel! Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Morning buffet and service was the best we experienced in Portugal. Room was large with a balcony overlooking the ocean. Very clean hotel. Free shuttle service to new and old town was added value. Will definitely return.
Feb 2020,50,Homely and pleasant accomodation,"I ´ll be back for sure!!! I chose the hotel because I am familar with Acoteias, Olhos de Auga and Albufeira. I appreciate a relaxed atmosphere instead of snobbistc behavour. The location is absolutely top."
Feb 2020,50,Perfect holiday,We come every year.My son love the Kids Club!I love the burgers. We like everything there. We will come back!!!!!!!!!Everything was perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thank you for your services!!!!!!!!!!!!!See you next year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Feb 2020,40,First visit to Portugal ,"Returned yesterday from this hotel in Portugal, on the whole it was a lovely holiday but there are a few things that we felt could be improved upon.  Whilst there I celebrated my birthday, on the afternoon I was very surprised by a knock at the door and a tray with a cake and a bottle of bubbly was delivered, from the management and staff, it was a lovely surprise and very much appreciated. The Pro’s - the hotel is lovely as are the staff, the situation of the hotel right on the beach is beautiful.  The shuttle bus to the new and old town are a definite plus.The meals generally were quite good, but it did seem that a large majority of the meals in the evenings were very heavily flavoured with garlic.  The breakfast was excellent and the choices vast.The cons - Whilst we were there there was a conference at the hotel for 3 nights, the guests of the hotel were not advised this was going to happen.  On the second two nights there was a burger/hot dog stall positioned next to the beach wall.  The noise from the conference attendees was horrendous, shouting and singing till 4.00am & 6.00am,  there was no consideration at all given to paying guests who were hoping for a restful & peaceful holiday.  We initially had to ask to move rooms as when sitting on the balcony the people on the next balcony appeared to be chain smokers and it was impossible to sit out and enjoy the view.  As non smokers this was a real problem for us, we had upgraded to a sea view room to be able to enjoy sitting out during the day and the evening. Reception staff were excellent and moved us very quickly.  This again became a problem on the last 4 nights of our stay as the people underneath our room were also smokers and this again impacted upon us being able to sit out. The smell was disgusting and wafted into our room, not a pleasant experience.Would it be an idea to have one side of the hotel allocated to smokers and the other side to non smokers then everybody could enjoy their little bit of space.The second week was much busier and there were a lot of children of all ages in the hotel, I know the hotel is not adult only but I wonder if it might be an idea and perhaps safer to have a separate time for families to use the dining room, the concern was that there were a lot of small children milling around when people were getting their meals and making their way back to their tables, the chances of accident was very real. A lovely hotel, the weather was amazing whilst we were there, Portugal as a destination and the people make it a great place to visit.  We have already booked for next year."
Feb 2020,50,Really good,"Have been to the beach bar here today,we are staying at the hotel and spa across the road.We had the vegetarian lasagne,steak sandwich and spaghetti bolognese. Service is rapid,food was really good and very reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend."
Feb 2020,50,Excellent hotel,"Just back form a long weekend stay and had brilliant time. Hotel grounds very impressive and well kept and with private beach access. The room was huge, clean with lovely sea view. Breakfast in restaurant was plenty, loved the fresh fruits and there was even prosecco :). Free shuttle to old town in Albufeira few time daily and loads of bars/restaurants 10 min walk away. The staff all around the hotel was very kind and attentive, always smiling. I did not like the idea of having to pay for each teabag or coffee sachet I use in the room, even for the sugar ( that would be the only negative point I have), so I just got my own supplies from nearby shop and there was a fridge in the room to store the milk. Overall great relaxing stay and would love to come back."
Feb 2020,50,Excellent,"Excellent service, beautiful location, delicious food , friendlig personal.Design of the hotel is very attractive and stylish, beach is perfect. Breakfast included a lot of fresh fruits .I had a lively week to stay."
Feb 2020,40,Great Location and Service,"We enjoyed three nights at this resort. Weather in February was excellent with sunshine everyday. Spouse loved our stay so much she wants to spend full month next year. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment with kitchen, and a patio and it was very suitable to our needs. As it was the off season, the whole complex was very quiet. Food in the main restaurant was very good and staff attentive. Couple of things to note: the kitchen has all appliances but has no provisions (even coffee and sugar) and there is no dish soap for washing up. Beds are very hard as others have noted. Lastly, management should design and print a map of their property detailing all restaurants, bars, etc and easy access to the beautiful beach. Would definitely stay here again inspite of minor issues noted."
Feb 2020,50,Very nice resort in a quiet surrounding,"Like this resort because of the friendly staff, it was very clean and quiet. And the most important; the location and the view. The food was delicious and especially the breakfast was excellent and a large variety !!!!!!!"
Jan 2020,50,Grande Is a Real good Hotel,"My Wife,Granddaughter,and myself  enjoyed our weeks Stay at this Hotel.From arrival at reception,suitcases taken to room,warm and friendly welcome from staff.then getting our room witch was as described, with a beautiful sea view.We all enjoyed our meals at both restaurants(and burger bar at the beach) and the staff were always warm and welcoming,especially the head of restaurant who said I looked Like Santa(I do) had a laugh.The free shuttle bus mon.to fri. was very welcome,to visit new and old towns.The outdoor swimming pools were great,but very cold (I am Scottish so did not bother me)but once in was great.I had 2 sessions in the Turkish bath,at only 5 euros per session was fantastic value for money,and highly recommend it.So to sum up,I give this hotel 5 star rating,and thank them for a perfect week."
Jan 2020,50,Lovely resort,Beautiful hotel with very big space .has a good view towards the sea ..with lovely beach side ..excellent for walk during sunset. Been here with my two friends enjoyed alot .the high street is 10 minutes walk .good places around to explore..............................................
Jan 2020,50,We couldn't fault anything,"My partner and I stayed for a week, and were swept away by the hotel itself and how friendly and helpful the staff were. We can't wait to go back. It was one of the best holidays we've ever had. Everything was amazing."
Jan 2020,10,Beware shady practices,"Do not book here, they overbook the rooms and cancel on you! Having booked and deposited for a room over two months ago we received a message saying our room was to be cancelled and we were no longer welcome to stay. Be very wary of booking here as there is a good chance you will never make it to your room!"
Jan 2020,50,Great resort - will come back with pleasure.,"Great hotel resort - well-situated directly on the beach, comfortable, quite modern building, friendly staff. Free parking. Each room has a balcony and a kettle. English TV channels. Would love to come back in summer to use outdoor swimming pools, beach, and a variety of restaurant/bars/disco. The only minor improvements I suggest are free tea/coffee in the room, some renovation of the furniture and a little special touch at breakfast."
Jan 2020,50,The best for January,We enjoyed our sea view room a lot. Even during this time of the year the climate is real nice. Location of the hotel is perfect. Staf is very kind & helpfull. Breakfast with the variety of fresh fruits is outstanding. Price/Performance (January 2020) almost impossible. They will see us again!
Jan 2020,50,Birthday get away ,What like to say a big thank you to all staff at grande real Santa eulalia for our amazing stay with them was there with my wife for our birthdays my 40th my wife ordered room service and I received a birthday cake and bottle of prosecco complementary the room was large and the sea view totally amazing rooms cleaned every day very friendly staff would do anything for you even for January the weather was great for the time of year old town well worth the visit very beautiful not much open but still shop and bars open for things to do just a beautiful place to visit with be back again thank grande real santa eulalia
Jan 2020,50,Great beach,We stayed here last year with 2 friends had a great time nice staff very helpful room very nice cleaned every day three pools we were self catering so did not use the restaurant but have booked again for June and we are going bed and breakfast looking forwood to getting back beach is fantastic
Jan 2020,50,Fabulous 5 Star,"This hotel is everything a 5 star hotel stands for. From the moment both my boyfriend and I stepped inside the hotel to the moment we departed, we were treated with top of the range 5 star service. We requested a sea view, quiet room and a kettle - all to which we received. The room was so spacious. The attention to detail from the hotel was admirable. The private beach is a gem, we spent quite some time here, very peaceful! There is 3 pools, one was heated so we could spend time in it. The majority of the people in the hotel spoke English or at least tried to which really helps! There was a large selection for breakfast which we really enjoyed each morning. Our room was cleaned very well each day. There’s a shuttle bus to new and old town for free which was very handy! (only during weekdays however) We did have to use taxis a little bit, however the taxi service “real transfers” which we used each time was 5 star service also!! The taxi driver we had was so friendly and gave us lots of information on the areas we went to! Nothing was ever an issue. We preferred vidamoura a lot more than old and new town it’s a 20 minute taxi but well worth it. A lot was open and it has a greater selection of restaurants. Highly recommend the restaurant san martino (Italian) 5 min drive from hotel - it was delish!    We would absolutely return to this hotel as it ticked all boxes for a fun relaxing holiday with zero stress."
Jan 2020,40,Beautiful location,"Lovely hotel in nice area on the beach  weather was warm and sunny for January very cold in the evening.hotel set in lovely gardens ,staff were fantastic very friendly and helpful ,breakfast was excellent good choice and room kept well .had a room with sea view great balcony view was lovely but rooms were clean but dated pillows definitely need changing  but a very spacious room had a lovely week and a perfect week in sunshine would recommend the hotel in a quieter area of Albufeira"
Jan 2020,50,Superb Hotel,"Stayed here last year as a family with young children and cannot recommend the hotel highly enough. The staff are wonderful to deal with, nothing was too much trouble. I had a requested a self catering house in a certain area, and got exactly what I request. The hotel breakfast is the best I have ever had while travelling, the restaurant staff especially were wonderful. I am looking forward to returning again this year, for a longer stay."
Jan 2020,40,Très bien situé!,"The close proximity to the beautiful beach and general layout of hotel and facilities. The location on the beach is outstanding. Very friendly staff, spacious room with spacious beds. We went there in January so it as really calm ! The only minus was the bed, old mattresses.... The rooms are a little old fashioned and could need an update but overall it is more than ok. Thank you !"
Jan 2020,50,A True 5 star!,"A True 5 star! All of the best, facilities but most of all very nice and efficient staff. I surely recommend. I didn't took breakfast at the hotel once I find it somehow expensive for a continental breakfast."
Jan 2020,50,Visit To The Algarve,The hotel was situated in an excellent position for convenience to local entertainment and beach facilities. The staff were always available and all enquiries were dealt with speedily and in a friendly manner. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family. The only reservation I have about the room was the lighting which was a bit low when you were reading.
Jan 2020,50,Great Break,"We had a fantastic week stay here in a self-catering apartment in Dec-Jan. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the facilities were excellent. Located next to a great beach, and in easy range of Albufeira, but secluded and peaceful as well."
Jan 2020,50,I love Portugal and the Grande Real Santa Eulalia,"2nd time to stay, last minute trip.  New years eve in old town amazing fireworks.  We stayed in the self catering apartments. The receptions staff and porters so helpful, the ladies who cleaned the room every, all the staff are so nice and genuinely helpful and patient.  It is a dream to work on the beach in sunshine on the 1st of January, 2020.  Such a wonderful hotel.  Its heaven.  Thank you."
Jan 2020,50,Excellent Stay,"Excellent location, close to beach and so relaxing. Staff were excellent everywhere, from the reception , the cleaners, bar and restaurant to the beauty and spa. A great place to chill out. Escellent bus service to the new or old town."
Jan 2020,50,Great Xmas getaway,"Good value for money for a great Xmas getaway in beautiful Albufeira. The apartment was very clean with all the facilities you could ask for, the restaurants very nice and with a good variety of food, and the kids club very recreational for the kids. But for me, the star of the resort was the Thalassotherapy Spa!!!"
Jan 2020,30,Needs a complete refurbishment,"Not a 5 star hotel.  The lobby is quite impressive but as soon as you walk down the hallway to the elevator, you start to see the problems.  The paint effect on the walls resembles mildew.  The carpeting in the hallways is dirty, not to mention ugly.  The lines on it would make you dizzy.  The rooms are clean and spacious, but so out-of-date and worn out.  There was a rather large area of damp on the bedroom wall (Room 217).  We believe this is from a possible leak from the bathroom shower/bath.  The sea view from our room was spectacular, but was slightly ruined by the dilapidated tennis court which needs total refurbishment - the astro turf is worn and faded and the paint is peeling off the boundary walls. The tea making facilities were a bit of a joke.  You have to boil the kettle on the floor which is a safety issue.  Then, the hotel does not explain that the first batch of tea, coffee, sugar, and bottled water are complimentary, yet you have to pay for each individual tea bag, etc. thereafter and you don't supply milk.  The dinner (we stayed half board) was A la Carte on one night and buffet the rest of our stay.  We were told A la Carte Monday - Thursday with buffet Friday to Sunday, but this didn't happen (we stayed Thursday night to Thursday afternoon).  The food the first 2 nights was delicious and fresh and we were really impressed but it started to decline the following nights.  The hotel information booklet states that the water is safe to drink yet you did not supply a pitcher of water on any of the dining tables and charged us nearly 4 euros for 1 bottled water.  Room cleaning was varied - cleaners sometimes forgetful but I'm sure they have a large amount of rooms to go through.  All staff very friendly and helpful but at the end of our dinners, we were met with slightly aggressive staff at the computer when it came to paying for our water.  The Atlântico and it's staff were great!! There is one thing I want to strongly complain about....the bird show....unacceptable.... the birds were brought in to the hotel lobby late at night to 'entertain' the hotel guests.  They should be in their natural habitat and not in a hotel!!  We went to our room, rather than watch but were told the following morning that one of the birds got frightened and flew straight into the glass door!!!"
Jan 2020,40,Christmas in Portugal,"We stayed last year and enjoyed the Christmas Gala though it was chaotic, this year was more organised but not as good! Food average too much fish for me, even fish soup !! Entertaining last year very good, this year poorRoom cleaning varied, but mainly poor, pillows constantly mixed up and often left on top of my sun hat which was on the case!! Night dresses thrown into the chair ( not by me) and left thereOverall a very nice hotel but room to improve"
Jan 2020,30,Not for me,Lovely hotel but in the middle of nowhere . Reception staff amazing . Lights in reception always too bright for entertainment . No little shop so forced to pay ridiculous price for a coke . Not decorated enough for Christmas
Jan 2020,20,Not a 5 star experience,"Beach was lovely and structure of building good. Food excellent however things that go to make a 5 star experience were missing in there place were chipped and unstable dining chairs, worn and stained seating in bar area, workman style tea mugs in bedroom, non functioning air conditioning, spa out of commission, charging for tea, coffee, milk etc in room (1.5 Euro each tea bag), the use of a voucher system for meals (very humiliating experience) a very large complex no map or instruction given for guidance around site the first evening in the dining room we had to sit with outdoor jackets on as it was so cold. Initial request to speak to a manager brought no response."
Jan 2020,40,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel, we used as bed and breakfast to explore the Algarve. Our first visit to Algarve.  Hotel fine and breakfast was all anyone could ask for.A small comment is that the bed, we found to be too hard to be comfortable."
Dec 2019,40,Room was clean and comfortable.,The dinner buffet was not a good value for 29 euros. The meat dishes of veal and pork were of poor quality and lacked flavor. I would recommend eating in town for a better food value. The hotel was situated in a beautiful area and the service stall could not have been more helpful. I don’t know why the hotel would put out such a poor quality of a buffet when everything else was of high quality.
Dec 2019,50,"Very good Stay, Probaly the best service ever","Best service I have ever had, excellent facilities, very good spa, a little pricey but you expect that from a 5 star, rooms where cleaned everyday and maids where brilliant even waiting when we wanted a laying would defiantly recommend for children as kids clubs where amazing. Literally the only thing wrong was TV channels and Bed Firmness but out of everything would rate the hotel out of this world"
Dec 2019,50,Great Hotel and great service,"Stayed with family for seven nights. We had a great time there. Kids(9 and 5 years old) really loved the kids club. Food was superb, customer service excellent.They try to provide best in class personalized service. My wife's b'day was during our stay, she was provided with complimentary champagne and cake delivered to our apartment. We had bit to trouble with water heating, we were offered options to choose from: stay in same apartment and get it fixed, move to different room(with upgrade to pool side apartment). In addition we were again given champagne for inconvenience. That gave the impression of the hotel trying to provide best in class service and experience."
Dec 2019,50,Fantastic!!!!,"Stayed here in may 2019 with my mum, the food , the room, the cleaness everything 5 stars!!! staff very friendly and helpful. theres a free bus that takes you into old town and new town and theres designated pick up places. 100% recommend. i am already looking at my next trip away!!"
Dec 2019,50,Great place,Very good experience Love to stay at Hrande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa. Very nice location and it was very good weather. Very good facilities at the resort. Friendly staff members. Very helpful
Dec 2019,50,xmas hols,"I thoroughly enjoyed our xmas stay with yourselves from start to finish.  I cant fault any of it.  We were extremely impressed with the xmas eve banquet, it was out of this world and so unexpected. The staff are so friendly and helpful and I strongly recommend anyone to go to this hotel.  also, the bus into the old and new town is an added bonus."
Dec 2019,40,Very pleasant stay,"The staff couldn’t be more helpful, all lovely. We went at a very quiet time of year so there wasn’t much to do in the hotel but the room was great, very clean. They have free shuttle buses from the hotel to the old and new town. We had an event on at the hotel while we were there so the shuttle buses couldn’t get in, but they had staff taking us to the bus stop at the top of the road on golf buggies which we found was brilliant, couldn’t be more helpful. Pools were clean. Private beach access, the beach is beautiful too. The food wasn’t amazing but there was enough to eat. We only went bed and breakfast and the breakfast wasn’t fantastic. Room was cleaned every day but I don’t think the sheets were changed very often. Chocolate was put on your pillow everyday. When we arrived, there was slippers and gowns for us which was great. Everybody was friendly, the burger restaurant in the hotel is absolutely lovely. The burgers are to die for! Overall nice place to stay, would highly recommend but it’s not really for kids as there isn’t much to do. Would recommend it for friends and couples."
Dec 2019,20,Very bad fourth experience,"very angry about this 4th experience: bad checkin, my suite was noisy and in bad conditions (parquet to be renewed, bathroom in bad condition, ...)Diner was bad: bad quality of salads (I asked a salad with asparagus and only a little asparagus was offered); Thalassotherapy not functionning, fitness with old machines)Too many ""fiestas"" in the night until 4pm!!!etc.etc"
Dec 2019,50,Wonderful ,This was our third winter break  stay at the Grand Real and it was wonderful. The location beside the beach is fantastic and the facilities are superb.On arrival the guys on reception were so helpful and welcoming changing our room when we asked. Breakfasts are superb and the rooms spotless.Wonderful break.
Dec 2019,40,"Good hotel, great kids club. Winter menu needs more option","We arrived as a family during the winter months. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel if you can get it at a good price. Here are the pros:Great kids club staff. Although only the small wood hut is open in winter they did make the stay enjoyable for our kids. Frequent cleaningGood reception very helpfulAmazing beach which is very close to hotelMain consWe are vegetarian and went full board. Options were too limited. We could only choose from a cheese baguette, gnocchi and pizza. For the kids it was pretty much pizza and chips. Would advise you go in summer when buffet is open for more variety. Cannot use the vouchers anywhere but main restaurant. They will not provide tap water so you are forced to buy drinks. Strange as this was fine at breakfast.  Because of this we cannot give the full 5 starsRooms were clean but there were alot of ants.We are a family of 4. The sofa bed is very hard and uncomfortable.No access to indoor pool for kids in winter. Outdoor heated pool is too cold so we didn't use pool at all.Overall as I said for the low price we feel it was good however would question it not being a 5 star hotel and it being more like a 4  star at a pushfor reasons mentioned above.We would not stay in the winter time again here and will explore something in the canaries but perhaps summer we would look back here if the deal was right."
Dec 2019,40,December break,Resort and staff are amazing and can not fault this hotel.I wouldn’t go back to Albufeira in December again though as most things were closed and my Children were bored and there was nothing to do weather also a factor in that. Kids club could of been better and for a broader audience
Dec 2019,40,"Great Hotel, Great Beach",Great location and views of the beach and ocean.  The room was very comfortable and general facilities were very good.  Staff on reception very helpful and informative on what would be good day trips.  Overall a great hotel!.
Dec 2019,50,Awesome!,Must visit . Awesome location. Nice service. Nice and spacious rooms depending on your choices made.Best for solo and family trips. Good sea food and Burgers. Breakfast and dinner are with variety and quality
Dec 2019,50,Fabulous stay I would highly recommend,Our stay from start to finish was amazing I couldn’t fault the hotel the staff were so helpful. We booked the anniversary dinner to celebrate me parters 30th birthday while we were there I would highly recommend anyone that’s staying at the hotel that have a celebration Occurring to book this the staff went beyond themselves to make sure the night was one to remember. We are already looking into booking a return holiday in the summer
Dec 2019,50,Lovely,Lovely location hotel We went as a couple with friends and we loved it Would be even better if we went in season which is why we will be going back 😂 recommend this hotel and the beach is nice tooSpacious room we had a studio The only problem I had was they didn’t put a complementary coffee in our room I would have appreciated that although there is a kettle and everything you need in your room I wish I would have taken my own coffee to make a cuppa like I usually would lol but Apart from this everything is ok 👌
Dec 2019,50,Amazing,The staff went above and beyond for my husbands birthday with no request or prompt.Very clean and comfortable Beautiful location and a stones throw from the beach.We will come back again with the kids. Thank you so much
Dec 2019,50,Great Hotel,The hotel made every effort to make sure we was comfortable.Hotel is a way out from the main town of Albufeira but a taxi costs around €6-7 and the hotel also runs free shuttle buses.Very quiet and relaxing holiday!
Dec 2019,50,Short stay,"Excellent hotel set in a beautiful location there service was excellent there food was very good  . A good variety, and there staff where very helpful will be back again In the near future brian murphy @ Rosemarie"
Dec 2019,40,Winter break Algarve,Very good choice  for a winter break. Great location with easy access to Albufeira and the rest if Algarve. Big free car park in front if the hotel is an added bonus. Sales staff very helpful to arrange a room upgrade.
Dec 2019,50,Wonderful Hotel,"The hotel is perfect for a quiet getaway with stunning views, great service and winter sunshine.  The sunsets are spectacular and the staff are excellent.  We have stayed here a few times now and always leave wanting to stay longer."
Dec 2019,40,Rooms,"The rooms are old, the furniture and  chairs are stained and they require work, the bathroom is outdated. The balcony is falling apart with chunks of plaster about to fall on the floor. The spa is over priced."
Dec 2019,50,Great hotel & Location (RUDE STAFF AT BREAKFAST),"Beautiful hotel, parking available directly outside, extremely polite and professional front house staff, spacious room with a sea view. Beach is a 3 minute walk away. Breakfast staff extremely rude cleared plates from all tables around except ours (deliberately avoid us) turning up their noses and make us feel very unwelcome.Dinner service was much more professional, food was exceptional. Lots to do local would recommend hiring a car."
Dec 2019,50,Fabulous Location,"Booked the holiday through Loveholidays! Have to say our expectations weren’t what we expected the hotel was fabulous in a beautiful location! Waking up and seeing the sea view was fab! All the staff were very helpful, couldn’t do enough for you! Would highly recommend! Thank you for a lovely stay at your fabulous hotel!"
Dec 2019,40,Short Break,Hotel is located in a very good location rooms are available with sea view.and has lot of facility but this time of the year they are limited and good breakfast and the dinner only limited choices as buffet service was not available.  I dont mind visit again with family on summer time to see the most.
Dec 2019,50,Great stay,Great stay and perfekt Location... Breakfast overwhelming and very nice staff. Good Pizzeria just outside the Resort If the Restaurants are good expensive. Recommendation for Business and Families Aline.
Dec 2019,50,Perfect Hotel,"The hotel was gorgeous, the staff where friendly, cleaner cleaned every single day. Beach right on your door step. I would take marks off for this issue but I just want to let other people know if you are staying in the grand real it’s a little bit more expensive to eat in the hotel restaurant and burger place but the food is worth the price. It was one of the best places I have ever stayed to be honest. Beautiful and Quiet. I recommend to everyone to stay."
Dec 2019,50,Very nice resort with beautiful beach,"Beautiful resort for couples or families. Friendly personal, delicious breakfast, beautiful beach,bus service to town centre,every day clean rooms, nespresso coffee machine in each room, activities for children"
Dec 2019,40,Return visit to Portugal,"Usually stay in hotels but thought we would give a studio apartment a try, this was not the success we hoped for. Felt like we were away from it all. Having our own holiday home in the UK, West Wales, which is very well equipped, we found the studio apartment at the Grand Real lacking in this regard.The apartment cleaning staff were lovely and friendly and did their best. But due to the air conditioning and overall apartment environnement my partner and myself developed bad chests, in fact my partner had to see a Doctor who prescribed antibiotics. Whether staying in the hotel would have been better, remains to be seen."
Nov 2019,40,Algarve resort,"Nice beach, apartment not kitchenette not well equipped,patio had NO shade- not covered and no umbrella and no privacy. No soundproofing, so difficult to sleep when noisy. Kids were up until midnight.Free bus service to 2 town locations was efficient and necessary and appreciated.Lots of room in apartments, but furniture was worn and tattered."
Nov 2019,50,Great stay,"Lovely hotel with great amenities. Very friendly staff who can't do enough for you. My stay was full board and the food in the main restaurant was excellent, particularly breakfast and the a la carte menu at lunch."
Nov 2019,50,Superb,Most enjoyable trip highly recommend paul claffey tours and  hotel 🏨   Loved every minute & staff so friendly and helpful no matter what hour you needed assistance.  Highly recommend and can’t wait to return in 2020
Nov 2019,50,Fantastic,"We were away for a short break with our 1 year old, who fell ill whilst we were there. I really can't fault any of the staff enough, they helped to keep our son happy and called a doctor for him when requested. We really can't thank them enough."
Nov 2019,50,Excellent break,"We couldn't have asked more from the staff they were helpful and courteous at all times, nothing appeared to be too much trouble.Our apartment was clean tidy and of a very good standard.We took advantage of the spa having a treatment and time  in the thalasotherapy pool which was amazing.The only disappointment was when we booked it did say indoor pool which we had intended to use daily, the only indoor pool was in the Spa and not for general swimming.The only other negative was the lack of choice for vegetarians, however the certainly would not deter me from returning for another break."
Nov 2019,50,Amazing,"I loved every part of the hotel, definitely worth staying in the summer time or any time of the year, absolutely amazing. A must when in Albufeira. Go Books  now .. you’ll won’t regret any of it at all."
Nov 2019,50,resort stay,"Extremely good rating for this accommodation, location and services offered, facilities excellent and helpful staff.  The bar, lounge, pool areas, dining rooms and reception are very bright and decor is pleasing all round."
Nov 2019,50,Hotel stay,When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the staff who took our suit cases to our room while we checked in. The staff where really helpful and friendly. The view from the hotel to the sea was really good and the walk to the beach was nothing. You have bus in to albufeira like every hour for free which was really good.
Nov 2019,50,Would highly recommend,"Enjoyed every bit of our stay, planning to return to this hotel with the kids next time. Everywhere was accessible and local. Service was great, resort and hotel room were lovely. Facilities were great, all in one hotel couldn’t ask for anything better"
Nov 2019,40,Beautiful beach,"The staff are amazing, the a la carté meal in the restaurant was excellent and the amenities are plenty. The hotel is on a fabulous beach and it’s gorgeous to walk along and relax. The pool area is okay although we didn’t venture into the water.The bus to the town is handy.We didn’t realise how close the hotel was to the town when W walking until closer to the end of our holiday. It seems longer on the bus but in fact when you turn left and walk for 5 minutes, your in the heart of the bars and restaurants.The bedrooms are in need of a little updating and a few small things would really make a huge difference such as more and better quality shampoos, conditioners, etc. Any other 5 star hotel we have stayed in would have toothbrushes and cleansers, and maybe a razor or other nice little extras but here it was shampooing conditioner and shower/bath gel and body lotion. A coffee machine would make a nice modern addition too. But lucky our room had the most amazing balcony with a view that we could watch all day and night! So really the room being a little outdated didn’t make any difference. Unfortunately we had to cut our holiday short due to a family emergency back home and the staff at the hotel, helped us to arrange taxis and printed train time tables and were very supportive at a very difficult time so many thanks must go to the staff, thank you and well done."
Nov 2019,40,Nice hotel but need a bit upgrade,Me and my friend went there for a long weekend staff of lovely they upgraded our room to 1 bedroom apartment . When we got in the apartment was a ground floor lovely little apartment with kitchenette so the bad hub but no pots and shower had curtain still what I find very old and unhygienic also not many option for vegans.spa was ok but didn’t feel like a relaxing spa more felt like swimming pool gym area  for a 5* hotel was expecting bit more but overall was nice
Nov 2019,50,Fantastic hotel thoroughly recommended,"Excellent customer experience, this is our 2nd visit!! , large, clean accommodation, really lovely staff and the evening entertainment was brilliant, beautiful setting with private beach we highly recommend this hotel to couples families and buisiness travellers for a relaxed personalised stay."
Nov 2019,50,Lovely hotel in a great secluded location,"If you are looking for a luxurious quiet retreat with a really nice Spa then this hotel is a great choice.Very clean, lovely beach right in front of the hotel. Rooms are well appointed and clean. Food is of good quality and variety."
Nov 2019,30,Not 5 star very disappointed,"Returned yesterday from our 5 night break this was a last minute booking due to unforseen circumstances. 1 leaky kettle, 2,wrong info on instructions when using the safe which made it difficult. 3, Maid does not refill tea/coffee when asked for extra coffee and milk was told it will be 15 euros or go to the bar as it may be cheaper? Buffet hot food lukewarm. Lunch when ordered is very good as is cooked fresh. Staff friendly and helpful although you have to ask for excursions as not told there are any,? Nice hotel we have stayed in better 3 star across the world."
Nov 2019,40,My Review,"I think only a few  things were lacking in the room  - the poor quality of the toilet paper, the facf that coffee, sugar, milk etc had to be purchased and there was not an irob/ironing board available in the room."
Nov 2019,50,holday,enjoyed our stay location was perfect  room was big clean  and comfortable. staff were polite and helpful. breakfast could of been better if the food was hotter and there was English sausages. bus service  to old town was great. beach was clean at all times. hotel was nice and quiet at night time
Nov 2019,40,NIce resort,"We stayed at the end of the season (November 2019). We were lucky with the weather...sunny and warm each day. The resort at this time of year was quite and calm (just what we needed). The heated pool was ideal for the afternoon or when is was a little cloudy. There was enough to keep us (two adults and kids 12 & 9) entertained between the excellent meals. We were full board and all came away having gained a couple of kilos! The array of options for breakfast was excellent. Lunch quality was good but the same options each day became a little boring. This was made up for in the evening when each day a different and wide variety of good quality options was available. Breakfast and supper were buffets so quantity was up to you. The sports facilities could do with an upgrade but were functional. The beach is public but has private access from the hotel. It is a lovely sandy, picturesque beach and was quite while we were there. The rooms were nice and a good setup for a family like ours. Our two kids shared the lounge which was well equipped with two sofa beds. There was also a nice kitchen area if you wanted to self cater. The bedroom for the grown ups was a good size and comfortably set up. I word of caution. When we visited a few years ago, our son, then aged 5 was able to open the patio door in the lounge and make a bid for escape. We had to put the kids in the bedroom while we slept on the sofa bed in the lounge.Overall a lovely resort with nice friendly staff that is well setup and appointed. I'd go back."
Nov 2019,40,Great Place,"Lovely staff and location, great amenities available, only negative we encountered was that our room smelt of cigarette smoke and decor looked tired (marks along the wall, desks heavily scratched, mirror scratched up etc.), apart from that, had great time, breakfast was fantastic with a good variety, the beach bar is a top place to hang out, would come again but maybe get a different room"
Nov 2019,40,Not any more a 5 stars,"Built 15 years ago, the hotel  shows now its age., mainly  the rooms.There was mold around the bath, the water flow is low; old type faucet should be replaced; refreshing would be a good move. Otherwise everything was OK.Nice and vast lobby; very good breakfast  as well as the  evening buffet; good service from the personal. Beautiful beach well maintained."
Nov 2019,50,Great stay,Surpassed expectations.  Stunning setting. Stayed with wife and 2 year old. Stayed in two bed apartment. Was huge. Got upgraded on arrival from a one bed. Delighted. Staff friendly.  Couldn't say a bad word
Nov 2019,50,Amazing holiday 😎,"Me an partner came here on the 5th of November until the 12th we came home yesterday 😢. This hotel is beautiful in every way. It’s located on a stunning beach where you have such amazing views from the hotel an the pool area. The staff cannot do enough for you and cater for your every possible needs. The weather even for this time of the year was really nice some days up to 26 degrees. There’s not a lot outside the hotel so if your looking for a quiet relaxing holiday it’s perfect, although there is a free bus into new town and old town from outside the hotel lobby where you have a lot of bars an restaurants. Overall this holiday was amazing an I’m already looking to book again for next summer but for 2 weeks instead of 1. Thankyou to all the hotel staff who made our stay that extra special."
Nov 2019,50,Irene McCabe,"Stayed in Grande Real Santa Eulalia recently,from the moment we arrived we were looked after so well staff could not have been more helpful nothing was too much trouble have to mention Irena she was brilliant, beautiful Hotel breakfast was amazing view from room 327 spectacular! would definitely recommend this Hotel and would certainly stay there again."
Nov 2019,30,3 night break,"The hotel must only have 5 stars due to the private beach, after paying nearly £900 for a 3 night stay for 1 adult and 2 children I expected more. The rooms were rundown, I expected a proper bed and not a lumpy pull out sofa. He 2 bathrooms were clean but running green water in one and brown water in the other. There were chunks of plaster missing out of the walls and the tv only worked in Spanish. The food was appalling and most of the bars and resteraunts were closed and no evening entertainment so had to walk into town on an evening"
Nov 2019,50,Great Stay,"Excellent stay in late Oct/early Nov - the staff were incredible and went so far beyond normal duty to help out guests at all times (desk/breakfast/room-cleaners, everyone involved). Breakfast was excellent and there is a frequent bus service to both the new and the old town. Night time music was also excellent. The beach at the hotel is exceptionally clean. Although a little bit outside of the town I would highly recommend (Taxi to new town approx €4 - old town approx €6). Plenty of privacy and all food/bar options were terrific."
Nov 2019,50,Just Fabulous ! ,We visited the Grande Real Santa Eulália resort for a week in October as a family holiday. There were 2 x Adults and 2 x boys (7) & (4) in total. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we had the most fantastic experience. Every member of staff we met could not have been more helpful and the resort facilities are fantastic from the numerous pools scattered around the complex to the ultimately brilliant location on the beach front. We had a one bedroom self catering apartment which was massive with an open garden outlook and it was cleaned each and every day by the maids to a very high standard. Albeit we did not use the Spa facilities we did use the gym on occasion which is free for guests and it has everything you would need for a decent workout. The star of the show for our family had to be the free kids club which our boys absolutely loved. There were different activities every day and the staff there were just absolutely brilliant with all the children. This facility really made our holiday and allowed my wife and I for the first time really since the boys arrived to spend some relaxing quality time together. I long for our afternoon stroll along the beach to the most fantastic little elevated beach bar where we would enjoy some light refreshments safe in the knowledge our boys were being looked after properly and importantly having fun. Our routine was to collect the boys from the club after that and then spend our time body boarding in the sea. Honestly it was simply fantastic. In addition the position of the hotel is such that if you do not wish to take the courtesy bus into the resort centre then more local (and more cost effective) alternative bars/restaurants were literally only a few minutes walk away. This was honestly one of the best and most relaxing (well as relaxing as you can get with a 7 and 4 year old in tow!) holiday we have had and I would return to the Grande Real Santa Eulália resort tomorrow if we could. We have recommended this resort to all our friends and I would highly recommend it to all reading this review. Well done to all the staff at this amazing resort. Top job 👍
Nov 2019,50,A Great Family Sports/Activity Holiday: October/November,An excellent hotel in a fabulous location. The staff are excellent and friendly. Breakfasts are great and I would book half board next time as alternative restaurants were not really available. Surprisingly it was quite difficult to get seafood as the seafood restaurants in the resort seem to close in September! It is not so easy to go off resort due to a busy road. Apart from this problem for us as seafood lovers we had a great time. We used the gym session which were excellent and highly recommended. We also used the tennis courts which I am afraid needed repair as they were very tired. One court (out of two) was unplayable because the net was set too low and this was not adjustable. The Bar Atlantico was in an excellent location with great friendly service but the menu was too international for our liking with no Portuguese seafood dishes which was a surprise. Overall a great place and highly recommended.
Nov 2019,40,Very good,Great location for the beech and to relax great shuttle bus service great choice of food for breakfast some areas could do with upgrading for a 5 star hotel. Staff very friendly and most helpful. Showers in bedroom could do wit an upgrade but overall nice place for relaxing holiday.
Nov 2019,50,Nice hotel on the beach,"Nice hotel by the sea, very friendly and helpful staff and wonderfully spacious rooms. We had a room with a sea view, beautiful.! Due to circumstances we had to leave a few days earlier. When checking out, the booking was made without any problems and we only paid for the nights we stayed. What a good service!"
Nov 2019,40,Wonderful location,The wine in the bar is far too expensive; the variety for lunch in pool bar is poor.Hotel location and rooms are very good. Value in this period is good. We advise to remove the outdated plastic curtain at the shower (move to glass).The survey is too long :(
Nov 2019,50,Family mini break,"Great hotel with professional friendly staff, very clean, nice pools and beach area to relax with family.  We enjoyed the beautiful beach bar overlooking the sea with food and drinks, we will definitely be back"
Nov 2019,50,Great family holiday over mid term,"We stayed in this hotel for a week during mid term.  Our 3 children aged 6, 7 and 9 absolutely love it as did we.  We went half board - breakfast was lovely with a great selection & although dining room for dinner was very quiet, we felt there was a great selection of food.  The hotel is in a stunning setting overlooking a beautiful beach.  The staff at the kids club were so kind to my children.  We will be returning :-)"
Nov 2019,50,Lovely relaxing holiday,"Really lovely hotel. We stayed in an apartment, which was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. The private beach is glorious, and the kids loved the pools. Staff all very friendly and helpful, particularly the guy who handled the luggage and the room cleaners. Would not hesitate to recommend."
Nov 2019,40,Another nice visit,"Our third time here, and as good as ever.  We tried self catering this time for the first time, just for breakfasts as there's lots of choice locally to eat out.  The room was well equipped, the cups were a bit small for British tastes and we had to buy washing up liquid and sponges, otherwise it was well furnished.  The staff were courteous as ever, and we ate in the Burger and Buffet restaurants which were very good.  We'll no doubt be back again soon, although the prices seem to have increased a lot on the previous year. Breakfast is 20Eur too which seems a bit steep."
Nov 2019,50,just beautiful,"excellent hotel great facillities breakfast was fab, the beach is the highlight just beside the hote. The hotel is a little quiet so you do have to go out at night but thats the not a problem with lots of places to go close by. the staff were lovely and could not have been friendlier, the hotel is clean and well managed I would definitely return.  It was my birthday during the trip and they sent a cake and bubbles to the room which was a lovely touch"
Nov 2019,50,Fantastic hotel,"Just back from a self catering holiday here at this fabulous hotel,staff were really lovely from the moment we checked in to checking out,food was fab,apartments were spotless and the views were amazing,the private beach is just a little slice of heaven and we will definitely be returning here as a family the next time."
Nov 2019,50,Best of the Best,"Best service and excellent food. The service staffs were very friendly and helpful. The only issue for me is the gym timing, I could prefer to do fitness eraly morning before my breakfast, but thats not an issue as I ran on the beach which was awesome too."
Nov 2019,50,Beyond Expectations!,"We stayed at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort hotel at the end of October. Everything about the hotel was excellent. We had a Seaview family room (recommended), which had 2 bathrooms, and 2 balconies. It was really quiet - no noise from other guests, and pool. The rooms were nicely cleaned every day to a very good standard. Fresh towels, and toiletries provided every day. The food in the restaurant was excellent. We stayed full board, and found the food quality and choice second to none. Really impressed with everything. The drinks we found were very pricey. Our son had his birthday during our stay, and we were blown away by the service - the hotel provided a complimentary cake, and the staff sang happy birthday to him! Couldn't have asked for more...it was just wonderful. Thank you so much for making this a memorable birthday for him. The free shuttle to town was fantastic, and very prompt, and the tour of Old Town done by the hotel staff very good. Kids even enjoyed it! The heated pool outside was perfect, and a really nice in November when the air temperature was a little cool. The gym, which we used every day was excellent. The equipment really good, good selection of free weights, nicely air conditioned with a water fountain and great music on the TV.But the best thing was the Kids Club. We visited during Halloween, and the staff dressed our kids up, face painted them and they all went trick or treating round the hotel. The staff were fantastic, and our kids asked every day to go to kids club. They absolutely loved the variety of activities. Thank you! We had an absolutely magical trip, that has given us beautiful memories of Portugal! The hotel, staff and everything about the hotel was perfect!"
Nov 2019,50,"Fabulous, relaxing family friendly hotel","The magnificent setting of this hotel was only bettered by the friendliness of the staff - I have never been in a hotel where the kids club was as well staffed with kind, interested staff who made the holiday a pleasure for parents and children alike! The options of trips out to a nearby adventure center (at a small cost) was a hit with both our younger and older children as was the fact that you could get diving lessons in the hotel pool (again at a small cost). Can't wait to go back here!"
Nov 2019,50,Autumn Break,"This was our fourth stay. Rooms comfortable and with everything you require. Very clean, comfortable beds. Rooms cleaned daily. We always go self-catering and cannot fault the equipment. Everything you need is there. Staff very accommodating and go out of their way to help from the moment you get there until you leave."
Nov 2019,40,Halloween Break,"This is our 2nd stay here and we enjoyed it very much. The hotel is situated on the beach and the weather was fantastic. There is a variety of restaurants and bars near by and a large supermarket about a mile away. My only complaints would be that our bed was very hard and would appear to be 2 single mattresses pushed together to create a double. Also on the second day the pool bar was closed and when we approached the staff who appeared to be cleaning and clearing out all the stock. We were told the bar was closed now for winter and we should go to the inside bar to get drinks. We did this on several occasions but it was quite a bit away from the pool and you had to climb 28 stairs and order you drinks and then come back down again.  My friend and I thought this most strange being a 5 star holiday and if the pool bar was closed surely they should have had waiter service! On our last day a waiter appeared out around the pool and took drink orders, which we did use.  I wonder did the hotel catch on that there was still a need for this service around the pool! Or had someone complained ??"
Nov 2019,40,Very good facility in an excellent location.,"Super friendly staff, excellent food choices, relaxing pool areas, clean facility. Lovely nearby beaches to explore and lots of dinner options in new and old town Albufeira. Just needs a few touch ups to make it a 5 star experience."
Nov 2019,50,Beautiful place,Just back from a relaxing stay at grand real santa eulalia. On arrival the staff were wonderful and helped us with our bags to our room. The room was spacious and immaculately kept. We had a stunning view of the beach. The breakfast was good lots of variety. We loved every minute of our stay. We would highly recommend and will definitely come back.
Oct 2019,40,Hotel to return to,Well worth a visit. I have stayed at this hotel 4 times with friends and family and all have loved it. Good for a relaxing break. It has a complimentary bus into Albufeira and also the service bus to Vilamoura stops right outside the hotel.
Oct 2019,20,Five Star? What decade?,"The tired looking wooden entrance sign told me all I needed to know. First impressions.Talking of firsts this is the only 5 star hotel that I've stayed in that didnt greet us with a welcome drink.The decor is tired,the pool side has a general ""don't care"" attitude. No sign of maintainance and no sign of a pool bar. Certainly no waiter service. Pool towels off colour and threadbare.The room is clean but ill designed in terms of sockets, As others have said kettle has to be plugged on the floor. The coffee/tea sugar offering hadn't been replenished . No attention to detail.The food offering is not as described. No Al a carte restaurant. Just a burger restaurant (pretty good) and a buffet - spectacularly bad! I've never eaten in a worse one in a hotel. The starter offering was made up of this mornings breakfast. This was not skillful recycling. Cold scrambled egg set in a pastry case with a slice of sausage. Really poor. No fresh fish or meat cooked to order so everything stewing under lights. The final straw? Stale cheese biscuits and no grapes to sweeten the sour taste of this experience.Having stayed many times at the nearby Porto Bay Falesia I recommend the manager here takes a look at how its done."
Oct 2019,20,Not recommended,"For a 5* hotel is totally disappointing.Rooms are old, no inside pool facilities for kids. All closest have a mold smell. Direct access to seaside compensate a little bit, but not to an 5* expectation."
Oct 2019,50,Fantastic place,"This is a very excellent hotel..We stayed in the self catering appartments, the rooms are very Portuguese in decoration, very clean and tidy and cleaners come in every day and do an excellent job. The staff in the main hotel and restaurants are very helpful and friendly and  cannot do enough for you. We hve enjoyed our stay here and at some point will return. I highly recommend this hotel."
Oct 2019,50,Lovely hotel,Good service and spotlessly clean. The food was very nice although the queues at breakfast were irritating as a little reorganisation of the position of the cooked food would have reduced the queues considerably.
Oct 2019,30,Poor vegetarian food choices during evening buffet,"The hotel generally is clean and tidy. Staff seem friendly and helpful. Vegetarian choice each evening in the buffet has been dreadful. It was tofu stew tonight, it was horrible, stewed vegetables last might equally as bad. It's a shame as meat eaters seem to have plenty of choice."
Oct 2019,50,Costa del folk,"Came for Costa del Folk music festival. Hotel was very good. Music (which was why we came) was excellent. Decent buffet breakfast and supper. Bed was comfy, room was clean. We will definitely come again."
Oct 2019,50,Excellent,Looking forward to 3rd stay in 2020.Found the sea view suite (247) just what we required.  Mattress in couch bed could be more comfortable. Maybe a second mattress or a  duvet over mattress would improve.
Oct 2019,40,Lovely holiday,My husband and I had a lovely time at the hotel. The bathrooms could be updated (new tiles as many broken) but the service is excellent and friendly and the hotel has everything! Staff are lovely. The mini bus is very handy.
Oct 2019,20,Poor customer service. No drinking Water in the room. Rip off!!!,"Am at the hotel right  since 3 days. Booked full board. (breakfast, lunch, dinner)Buffer breakfast and dinner only DRINKING WATER IS NOT INCLUDED. 4 EUROS FOR A SMALL BOTTLE!!!They don't even allow to carry your own water. Lunch menu at the real cozhina  limited, always empty. This was the only one we could eat in the full board.But the meal we had was very delicious but again had to buy expensive drinks and water.Coming to dinner. Never I had such TERRIBLE MENU.Me my wife had to rely on just fruits and desserts which were good. Again had to buy water.Not much for the kids. We only stayed in the beach.Beach is superb.tje famous golden sand. October and had sun burns. Again No sun beds given. Another company had sunbeds which you only had to hire. 15 euros per day per person. Such a rip off money extraction.These guys are only there for money but  don't think of customer care. DRINKING WATER AT LEASTI am giving 2stars only 1. Powerul wifi2.superb beach and lunch menu. Beware customers!!!"
Oct 2019,50,Another great visit,"Had a lovely time again at this hotel. Friendly staff as always, and clean and spacious apartment for a few days. Love the beach snack bar just to sit and watch the world go by.  Staff and food great.   Will be back."
Oct 2019,40,Lovely break,So lovely to be in the sunshine in October! Beautiful hotel with beach access. Service from staff excellent.  Everywhere clean.Courtesy coach into town. Breakfast excellent.  Other restaurants expensive and not the best quality.  Drinks expensive too. Could do with a happy hour!
Oct 2019,30,Food :(,"The evening meals were never hot! It's not hard to achieve so why is this hotel failing? I've stayed with a large group three times and there's been no improvement in this area at all. I heard numerous complaints regarding food temperature, some people said they won't stay here again."
Oct 2019,50,Costa del Folk Festival 3rd visit - see you again next year,"Fantastic Hotel, super design and layout, great food, and wonderful helpful staff.  We had a Garden View Room this year, it was comfortable, clean, and the daily service was impeccable.  Giant and really comfortable double bed, and we could even sea the sea.  Amazing breakfast buffet and a good evening dinner buffet although the main dishes were not very hot.  As a vegetarian I had no trouble finding enough to eat without having to ask for any special treatment. I very much appreciated the vegetarian dish added to the buffet this year. Sometimes I pinched the vegetables from the meat dishes as well ! The choice of fresh fruit at Breakfast and Dinner was excellent.  Good choice of desserts.  There were queues for the restaurant at peak times but it's difficult to cope with 700+ people all wanting eat at the same time in the break between the various activities and the evening concert.  We didn't mind sharing a table as we met some interesting people this way.  The young staff manning the pool bars spoke excellent English and were very extremely friendly and efficient.  A real credit to the Hotel and the image it gave of the Portuguese people.  We are already booked for Costa del Folk again next year."
Oct 2019,50,Costa del Folk,"Great festival in this lovely hotel. Plenty of space for everyone, music by the pool or quiet spaces if you prefer. Highly recommended. Helpful and friendly staff and amazing facilities all add up to a great holiday if you like British folk music."
Oct 2019,50,Costa del Folk,"I am looking forward already to our week at your hotel. Thank you, lovely food and wine in the sunshine with a comfortable room and leisure tim by the pool. This is our third visit to your hotel. We enjoyed the opportunity to listen to great music whilst swimming and sunbathing by the pool."
Oct 2019,50,End of season break,Travelled from our B&B for an end of season break taking in Costa del Folk.  This was our 2nd visit to this hotel and we will certainly be back.  Staff are very helpful and friendly; everywhere is kept clean and tidy;   rooms very comfortable and good choices at mealtimes.  Overall an excellent place for a holiday.
Oct 2019,50,"This is just heaven,,,,,,","Me and my partner  stayed here for 1 week ,weather was good ,we had a free bus to take us to old and new town ,the food is fantastic,  the beach  but the only thing is the water in the beach is freezing ,otherwise  fantastic hotel ,would recommend  to anyone ,the food is amazing , all we ate is fish , the rooms are cleaned every day, staff are Brill and helpful😁😁😁"
Oct 2019,50,"Grand Real Santa Eulália, offers easy beach access, with a choice of restaurants and amenities, near Old Town Albuferia","Stayed in the Main Hotel, but self catering options are also available. Lovely hotel with direct beach access. There are 5 restaurants offering a varied choice of menu, and excellent food. Rooms are decorated in typical Portuguese style, and beds are exceptionally comfortable. Staff are friendly and helpful. Although slightly outside the old town of Albufeira, there is a shuttle bus into the town daily. There is also a hairdresser, spa, gym, and small shop on site, supermarket however is situated outside of the complex approximately 10 mins walk away. There are two excellent restaurants just outside the main gates, and a would also recommend a visit to the village of Olhos del Água which has some great quirky bars."
Oct 2019,40,Good location on the beach,"We were disappointed that there was no free indoor swimming pool .To be in the heated pool is still cold .There was no entertainment in the hotel .itself .There was no activity on the beech.We ordered from with ocean  view ,we got pool view but finally beacaus it was on the first floor we prefer to stay in the room ."
Oct 2019,50,Nice hotel,"Good value for money, nice people and good location.The service of the front desk was really friendly. I’ve enjoyed my stay with the family, and would recommend it for families with small children. The kds club it great for them to play."
Oct 2019,40,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel - ideal for pleasure, business (conference facilities) and weddings ...Though I stayed here with a group of friends we all said we could return again with our children as the facilities and menu of activities on offer during peak season looked great...lots of pools across resort and the beach is at the front of the hotel(golden sand). Party strip is a short 10 min walk away. Cant fault the experience...breakfast (hot and continental) was great too!"
Oct 2019,50,Value For Money,This is a fantastic hotel set in a beautiful location. The apartments are fantastic and big. The customer service was excellent and the sea views were just stunning and the price was very reasonable for the quality of the hotel and the service you get. I'll defiantly be returning.
Oct 2019,50,Folk festival,"Very impressed with this hotel.  We are here on a package with Enjoy Travel for Costa Del Folk Portugal.  All inclusive.  Lots of choices for both breakfast and dinner.  It is my husband Peter’s birthday today and when we returned to our room this afternoon there was a trolly with a cake and a bottle of bubbly from the management waiting for us.  I had not mentioned anything to the hotel so don’t know how they found out.  Extremely impressed.  Our room is on the 2nd floor in the hotel.  Plenty of room - huge bed - large bathroom and balcony.  Overlooks entrance to hotel.  Would certainly recommend this hotel, staff very helpful and very friendly.  Oh and the weather is just right for us."
Oct 2019,50,Happy Holiday,"We had a great time staying in the hotel resort. We enjoyed every minute of it. The hotel had a high standard in terms of serving the customers(always quick response) and answering our queries. However, we would like to think that if the rooms in the resort can be more modern and less dated. The cooking facilities were generally good but if you can provide the guests with a sharper knife and washup liquid would have been much better. The shower head was a bit let down but the water pressure was fantastic. Overall we had a lovely stay . Thank you very much."
Oct 2019,50,Happy Holiday,Great Place for a nice stay. only 20 min walk to the strip if that where you want to go. Great facilitates at the hotel. staff all very friendly. when you need a cab to go out just pop in to reception  tell them and they phone for you. cabs arrive within 5 mins. Overall very enjoyable holiday here for then week. 10/10
Oct 2019,50,Amazing family holiday destination,We had a great stay. It was so convenient and luxurious. Perfect for families. Everything you needed at resort. Our baby got sick while we were there and the hotel staff had a doctor there in 20 minutes and gave us a late checkout to make it easier. Every interaction with staff was great. Would highly recommend! Loved the pools and the beach. Excellent
Oct 2019,10,Would give it zero if I could,"My friend and I booked this 5*  spa hotel as a relaxing break. It was supposed to be a much needed treat for us which we’ve never done before but it ended up in a row in the foyer with the manager who left me in tears. To set the scene we arrived on the Thursday and we were Initially told by reception that we could stay in the hotel on the day of departure (Monday) and use all the facilities and keep our luggage in the concierge room. This was also written in the guest book in the bedrooms as a standard policy as it is in most hotels. We purposely booked a late flight on the Monday home so we could get every last bit of benefit from short break. After checking into our room the young receptionist Jerome (who was the loveliest person at this hotel) sadly advised that they’d made a mistake and we couldn’t stay on the Monday as the hotel had been booked exclusively for 4 days for an event and we were informed that we would have to vacate the hotel at check out straight away but could leave our bags at the gates near the road where cars enter the grounds and we couldn’t access the grounds / restaurants again at all.  We were very disappointed to say the least and were not offered any form of recompense as an apology. To add to this initial upset the holiday continued to go downhill. We also had many issues with the restaurants. My friend can’t eat in buffet restaurants due to sauces on the food etc and this wasn’t a problem any other night as they had at least one of their other restaurants open but on the Sunday they closed all of the restaurants and used to main one to put the luggage in it from the conference guests (we were told this by the guest liaison lady) and we saw the bags stored there (we have a photo of this). This meant only buffet restaurant was open that evening. When you go to a hotel advertising a selection of restaurants you don’t expect to be left with one option on site at 32 euros a head which unfortunately isn’t actually an option due to dietary issues. On the first night we ate at the main restaurant near the foyer. I asked for a tea and was give a luke warm jug of water and t-bag. The t-bag wouldn’t do its thing as the water wasn’t hot enough so when I asked if I could have another t-bag and boiling hot water she reluctantly gave me some but then tried to charge me for two teas. At the end of the meal I asked if I could take my leftover milk from my tea to my room in the jug and she said I could take it if I paid 2 euros for it but I had to explain I’d already paid for it as it was from my tea and I only wanted to take it as i didn’t have milk in the room which is something you’d expect at a 5 star hotel. Also in the room there was only 1 of each sachet of tea/ coffee / green tea etc. Unusual for 2 guests staying. Maybe an oversight. As it turned out while we were on our “relaxing” holiday there were two conferences going on. One over the weekend with the foyer being overtaken for corporate drinks and I assume (possibly wrongly) chefs being dedicated to them which may be why the restaurants closed and the late bars being closed for those  corporate guests to enjoy. Then another conference overlapping arriving Sunday onwards. Some of the people from these events were swearing and drinking around the pool like a club 18-30’s in front of children. The staff didn’t clean up the empty cups and rubbish that were left lying around for over an hour while we were there (photo below). We were also told by the spa staff (which has a premium if you want to use it) that there was usually Pilates classes or similar on weekends but he couldn’t find them on the new sheet which the spa guy seemed confused about. Again possibly because of corporate guests being there and the classes not being needed. I can’t be sure. The “heated” pool outside was cold. The bus was only running once while we were there and hadn’t been running all week before we arrived-they said this was due to technical issues. We decided to bring up these issues with the guest liaison manager Jerome (I think that was his name-not to be confused with the receptionist Jerome) on the Sunday morning to tell him how disappointed we were with our overall experience. He talked to us like he was doing us a favour by letting us stay there and not like we’d paid money to stay there. He spoke down to us, he shouted at us, he refused to apologise to us for any inconvenience. He told me I wasn’t telling the truth about the letter on Saturday that was apparently slipped under people’s doors (I had to swear on my children’s lives we didn’t get it). This letter advised of the issue that people staying on Monday would need to vacate at check out. He made excuses for everything we brought up.  When we mentioned the restaurant being closed he said “just go to the buffet or go to the one on the beach”. He wouldn’t listen to our reasons why we couldn’t go there and the one on the beach was only open til 6pm and not open at night so he missed the point. The conversation in the foyer was recorded by a gentleman sat close by who came up to me later in the day after he saw me crying and sent me the video recordings. The highlight of the video has to be me saying “Are you not even going to apologise? He shrugged. I said “You could have offered good customer service here and offered a goodwill gesture of a bottle of wine or something as that’s what I’d have done in your situation . His rude response was “so you just want something for free- is that it?” Totally missing the point.In the end when they saw me in tears his female colleague gave him a signal that he needed to calm down. He then saw fit to apologise albeit not genuinely at first. I pointed that out and he softened. He offered wine but only sent it to our room 9 hours later when we’d been out for a meal (off-site) and we were going to bed. We ended up putting a note on the wine and leaving it for the lovely guy at reception who spoke to us on day one. Back to the conversation with the manager...I also mentioned to the manager that we’d seen previous (recent) comments on Trip Advisor about these conferences taking over the bar and foyer were they’d gone on to write that they will take comments on board but obviously that wasn’t true. He didn’t have an answer for that. The hotel in the end agreed to transfer us to their sister hotel on the Monday morning (we suggested this solution to them on day 1). Unfortunately that hotel was not in the best location. It’s not on the beach but I must say the staff in the sister hotel are lovely. All very friendly and helpful unlike Grande Santa Eulália. The people who we shared a taxi with to the sister hotel who were also turfed out like us told us that they too were shocked and even more so when Grande Santa Eulália refused to help them sort changing their airport taxi pick up from Grande Santa Eulália to their sister hotel. They’d booked it privately and having been given little notice they didn’t feel comfortable ringing the Portuguese taxi firm to explain and just wanted help but they refused. This isn’t a 5 * hotel -is it run down and it’s all about making money and not about looking after its guests unless they are corporate ones.Avoid this place at all costs. Please don’t reply to this review with “we will take your comments on board” as I know first hand that will not happen. You wouldn’t when we spoke to your manager directly and he made us feel like we were worthless hence this scathing review."
Oct 2019,50,stunning,"rooms clean, staff very helpful and knowledgeable, self catering apartments were spacious and well stocked for the kitchen. no complaints what so ever.  hotel has private beach for use by customers, absolutely 5 star treatment"
Oct 2019,50,October break,Booked this last minute after our holidays was cancelled with Thomas cook failure. We were very pleased with the hotel.top quality from the minute we arrived of the coach. Free bus was great. Taxis back were only 5 euro from new town and 10 from old town. We ate out each night so can't comment on the food. Would go back again.
Oct 2019,40,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel - we had an amazing stay. We would definitely go back 100%.  My 2 year old son had a great time. The 2 bed apartment was spacious and clean. Only downsides of the hotel: (1) food variety was severely lacking at the restaurants - this was a real problem for us; (2) they should heat all pools (not just 1), especially the kids pool; (3) loose paving stones everywhere - this is unfortunately quite dangerous when you have a 2 year old running around everywhere - please can you sort this out.Like I say - we had a wonderful time and the items I mentioned above are in no way deal breakers - we will definitely be back next year."
Oct 2019,50,Amazing hotel! ,"We recently stayed at Grande Real Santa Eulália for 4 nights and it was absolutely amazing. First of all, the staff were wonderful and super helpful! Nothing was ever too much trouble! The views from the hotel are incredible, it is truly beautiful and really is breathtaking. There a few restaurants near by which was great, and the new town, old town, Algarve shopping centre and zoo marine are just a short drive away. The free shuttle bus to the old and new town is a fantastic service! Thank you thank you thank you for an amazing holiday!"
Oct 2019,10,Awful sib standard,One of the worst hotels I've stayed in the whole place needs renovated  bed changed once no milk for tea or coffee cups never cleaned how did it get a 5 star rating I will never k now moisy the list goes on
Oct 2019,50,Great location for music event,"Stayed at this property for a week for a country music event with approx. 800 others. The staff were so helpful and the location was ""spot-on"". I  would struggle to fault it and we are certainly going back next year  to this event at this location."
Oct 2019,50,Very good,I was there for Paul Cuffley tour. It was great. Will be going again next year. I loved every minute  of my stay with you. Hope to get the same room 015. When I come next year. The beach was lovely but the sea was a bit cold
Oct 2019,40,Beautiful location. Worth a visit,"We booked a self catering villa with 2 bedrooms. This is a beautiful location and the place is worth a visit. We are a bit disappointed though, specially with the kitchenette. I think the person's responsible should pay a visit to self catering accommodations in the UK and take a lesson from that.We are strict vegetarians and we need to cook most of our meals. There are enough pots and pans and crockery. There is no washing up liquid, scourers,j-cloth, dish rack, peeler, can opener. Little things that would not cost more than £10.00 in total, but would make life easier for the guests.I hope some one will look into these small things, and do something about it.Having spent 3 nights (4 more to go) I am seeing things that aren't what one would expect from a place of this standard. I have attached a picture of the 2nd bathroom with shower. A person who is on the heavier side, would not even fit in it. I have seen small shower cubicles in my travel, but this beats then all.I wonder if all the 2 bedroom apartments have this size showers?  There is also a smell from the drains as soon as you open the door,which goes off once the exhaust hits in.On the plus side, it's clean, the staff are friendly and the beach is about 5 mins walk. If you are going out to the beach for the first time, it's not clearly sign posted so ,you might wonder if you were going the right way!"
Oct 2019,50,PAUL CLAFFEY IRISH COUNTRY MUSIC HOLIDAY,"Two of us went to the country music week, we had a brilliant time hotel was a 5 star resort in ever way.The entertainment was fab from the miniute you arrived to the time you were leaving staff and everyone you met made you feel at home. I will be recommending this holiday to my family and friends and we will be back next year. can't wait. well done to paul claffey and all his staff."
Oct 2019,50,fun week in the sun,"excellent hotel will stay here again, rooms very clean and comfortable, great location ,staff very friendly and helpful  .very close to shopping and the hotel is almost on the beach .we had a wonderful week of fun and games."
Oct 2019,40,GREAT HOTEL AND STAFF recommended,THIS HOTEL IS ONE OF THE BEST WE HAVE STAYED IN. there is very little we can say about it than its perfection at its best. Only the staff are so polite and helpful immaculately clean and the food is second to non. Truely worthy of a stay here you won't be disappointed  I took my wife here to say how sorry I was after booking out of the santa susanna resort Hotel which was disgusting to say the least
Oct 2019,50,Holiday in Portugal.,"Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at this hotel. They are exceptional, as is the hotel itself.  This was my fifth visit to this hotel and I will return again. Exemplary in every single way. Thank you."
Oct 2019,50,Paul Claffey Tour 2019,Fabulous hotel with brilliant staff who fully entered into the fun of the week. The apartment was perfectly equipped with all the necessities. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back to it again.
Oct 2019,50,Music Week,Beautiful Hotel and fantastic staff great food and very comfy bed. Would highly recommend this Hotel to any traveller for value and service brilliant location. Beautiful beach and bus services for day trips. Mona Ireland 2019
Oct 2019,50,excellent,have stayed in this hotel for the past five years. cant recommend this hotel highly enough from the minute you arrive you are treated like royalty . check in is quick reception staff are very friendly and very knowledgeable no request is too much . rooms are bright spacious and well air conditioned and who can fault the panaramc sea views . food is first class with plenty of places to dine and great variety  . definitely will be back again
Oct 2019,50,GREAT LOCATION,Situated on beach side. Bus shuttle several times a day but not at weekend takes you to the new town strip and the old town fisherman's harbour. Apartments are superb staff very friendly and all spoke good/reasonable English. Only had breakfast in hotel as past experience of evening food in restaurant not good. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.
Oct 2019,50,Wonderful gem of a hotel on the beach,"The Grand Real Santa Eulalia is a spectacular hotel, it location is stunning right on the beach. The complex is large but still feels very friendly. The staff are incredible; nothing is too much trouble. Prices of drinks are reasonable too!"
Oct 2019,50,Paul Claffey/Joe Walsh Tours,"Great week music,dancing. Fabulous hotel,clean, staff friendly, efficient. Top Mark's. Would highly recommend.  Children welcome.Exceptional variety of food from all restaurants in and around hotel come"
Oct 2019,40,"Pleasant Stay, Great View!","We stayed at the hotel for 5 days and the location was quite and tranquil. Our room had a great view of the ocean, beach and coastline. It was in a good location about 10 minutes drive from Albufeira and about a 10 minute walk to what they call ""Crazy Street"" (it is a party town you know). The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, but was a bit tired and not as modernly appointed as other hotels. Hotel amenities are good and appropriate for a 4 star hotel. Breakfast included with room is good value with an abundant selection of foods that will not disappoint. Hotel restaraunts are priced slightly higher than other choices in the area, some of which are walking distance. However, some of these restaraunts have fantastic views of the beach and ocean. The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful. The only negative was that the hotel shuttle that was supposed to be operating daily was not operating at all during our stay so we had to uber every time. Overall a great stay and a hotel I would recommend!"
Oct 2019,50,Visit is worthwhile,"Everything was very nice in the hotel, staff courteous. I just wanted more flexibility in vegan nutrition. The staff seemed to have a little idea what vegan food is. The staff may not know the difference between vegan and vegetarian.The rented studio was perfect. It was very large, close to the main house and the beach is so easy to reach. If you want, you have peace and quiet in this hotel and if you need help, you have an excellent service at your disposal. Would go again."
Sep 2019,50,Absolutely brilliant hotel,We have just come back from this hotel from start to finish we were treated like royalty the staff could not do enough for us our bags were brought over to our apartment and so were we on a car we also booked two excursions and they got us the best deal with transfers.The rooms are spotless they are cleaned everyday I could not recommend this hotel enough they made our holiday so enjoyable they even had water and milk in our apartment oartment when we arrived and sweets for my daughter which no other place I have stayed have done .We are even looking to book again for next year .👍
Sep 2019,50,Holiday to remember,"Everything a family wants in a holiday, only negative was shittle bus never ran and for some reason when we had to be gone by 10am , when they mean off premises they mean off premises completely .Even with this is mind I'd still go back in a heartbeat"
Sep 2019,30,No 5 star,"The building is lovely but not managed to it full ability. The self catering bars weren't used and pool wasnt cleaned and tidied at night. All the effort went into the large groups of corporate larger louts. Felt like a 18-30s holiday in magaluf. There was only 2 days out of 7 where the free bus into town was provided.!! And it's too far to walk, so cost 20euro every night in taxis"
Sep 2019,40,Not a 5 Star rating,"Was in Portugal for a wedding and this was recommended by the wedding planner amongst other Hotels. It is a lovely hotel but unfortunately doesn’t reach 5 stars for me.The approach, main reception and the front of house in general is very impressive and deserves its rating, what let’s this hotel down are the rooms and breakfast, we had a sea view room 209, and although very spacious with the biggest bed I have ever seen the room is in a very tired state and needs to be upgraded, the furniture seems old and quite tatty. The bathroom is also in need of some TLC, quite a bit of mould around the bath area and on the alarm pull cord.The breakfast had a huge choice of continental and English food, problem being is that the hot food was bordering on cold every morning, even on the last morning when eating at 07:00 the temperature of the food was no different. Must say the continental choice was amazing with very fresh produce.We ate at the Restaurant by the beach and I can highly recommend it for the food and great location.Credit to all the Staff, lovely people and very helpful"
Sep 2019,40,Lovely Resort,"The resort was lovely, rooms very clean, majority of staff very  friendly. The choice of food, along with opening hours of restaurants could do with some improvement. Rooms and hotel in general are very nice and kept very clean, but are due a bit of a refurb to really give that 5 star feel. Plenty of swimming pools, access to the beach, short walk to shops and restaurants. I would return here again, and would recommend to others."
Sep 2019,50,Greeting experience,"Special anniversary 40th  wedding anniversary (ruby anniversary)but no recognition at reception when mentioned,disappointed at this response to be told happy birthday by receptionist otherwise we were happy with our experience in your hotel"
Sep 2019,50,Grande real santa eulalia,Superb hotel with superb staff .we have been staying in this hotel for a number of years and are always welcomed back by all at reception including the people who bring our luggage to the room mario in the restaurant ilidio in the Atlantic . Jorge who takes us by coach to the old town and picks us up.looking forward to going back next year
Sep 2019,50,50th Birthday Weekend,Great hotel. We arrived early and not only was our room ready we were also given an upgrade. Lovely pool with a nice pool bar ( the two young lads were very friendly )Breakfast on a morning was good and lots to chose from. The hotel is away from old town / strip but only a short Uber awayWould defiantly recommend
Sep 2019,50,Ideal for self catering,Perfect for family and relations.Ideal setting for beach and pool.Great service and quality of food.The gardens and pools were very well kept and the whole complex was a delight.Coupled with good weather this was an excellent stay.
Sep 2019,40,Nice Hotel,"Hotel was nice, lovely setting. Some miscommunication around the buffet meal was not handled well. Value for money not great for the buffet meal. Food was average for that money and in comparison with wedding food which we ate there and was exceptional."
Sep 2019,50,Aishling scott,We got Married in your hotel in September and I could not rate them any better the staff couldn't do enough on the day and the whole stay we where there...I would highly recommend it..it has something for everyone X
Sep 2019,50,Happy guest,This is the second time I have stayed. Bed and breakfast. The staff are great and helpful. Rooms were clean. Breakfast has a really good variety of foods. Pools are clean and were quiet when we went. There was always sun loungers avilable.
Sep 2019,50,Fabulous stay here from check in to check out for a wedding with friends in September..We would highly recommend it.....,We had a fantastic time here in this beautiful hotel which had so much to offer..... We stayed in September for a friends wedding and found the staff so helpful and friendly.... nothing was a problem... We would highly recommend it and ate dying to go back again....
Sep 2019,20,Has potential but the hotel needs to double-down on the basics,"I stayed for 5 nights with my wife and 2 small children (1 and 3) in a sea view junior suite - room 341.  The room really was just two adjoining rooms with a small common walk-in area.  No microwave, but had mini fridge - two separate bathrooms.  The views over the pool and sea were nice as were the two decks (each room, separated) and double-wide sliding door walls to allow more open air in the room.  The hotel ultimately has potential based on facilities, location, and resort venue, however, the general service and maintenance is lacking for the price point.  Carpet in common area halls to room need cleaning, pools and deck area had visible heavy wear (missing tiles in all pools and wooden deck was faded and had multiple broken boards.  Trash from evening before were left in pool area the next morning (seemed staff worried about specific jobs as opposed to finished product quality - e.g., straighten chairs but leave empty bottles and cups for another person who was presumably responsible).  Breakfast services was not executed properly - very rushed/busy workers, cold food (near frozen potato cakes in hot area), and lack of quality of food left us waiting for lunch most of the days.  Silly stuff annoyed as well - for example, the staff were rude on several occasions when we asked for additional napkins.  Napkins!  We had room service twice - both times food was mediocre, especially for the price.  Walkways out of the resort to the main road were fine but needed some stones reset - havoc for baby stroller and certainly not 5-star grounds maintenance.  This is the ultimate feedback.  The resort is priced for 5-star but doesn't live up to the maintenance and service that such a rating commands.  The good news is, they can fix this and have a real gem."
Sep 2019,40,Nice quiet but family friendly resort,"Lovely accommodation, nice ambience and great views from the bar/main pool. Great if you have very little ones as rooms all have good AC, there are baby pools and staff are really friendly towards them."
Sep 2019,40,A bit overpriced.,"Great location but you pay for this. The breakfasts are very good, but restaurant very busy and there seems to be a lot of waiting around for eggs to be cooked, toast to go through the slow toaster, and queues for the coffee machine."
Sep 2019,30,Hotel review - September 2019,"Me and my partner stayed here for one week in September. We felt everything was reasonably good however the customer service side could be improved on. For a 5* expectation this was not that. We were ignored by staff and walked straight passed us without any sort of greeting and we had to ask if we could order a drink! The ‘free shuttle bus’ was great when it was actually running which was not every day even though we was told it would run all day, every day.Also on our last night they had a party of 50+ people which were having drinks & chatting however the staff had placed them and the drinks in the lobby area where me & my partner were trying to have a relaxing last drink along with other families but could not hear each other talk or think because of how loud this function was, which lead us to ending our holiday to go to bed sooner than actually wanting to. Other than all that happening, the hotel is lovely. Cleanliness is top notch and good variety of breakfast, views are superb and has easy access to the private beach."
Sep 2019,50,Trip through Portugal ,"Stayed in the main hotel for 3 nights while touring the southern region of Portugal. It’s  on the beach, although it’s a bit of a hike down to the sand area. There are various pools on the hotel grounds and plenty of umbrellas for shade. While we stayed in the main hotel, there are small houses on premises to stay in. Those are a bit farther from the pool, beach and main hotel area. The facility is beautiful, there’s a health club and tennis courts as well as a spa. The rooms are roomie, but our bathroom looked nothing like the ones pictured on their site. We had a room in the main hotel overlooking parking lot on 1st floor. Could not open curtains because there was no privacy. The internet worked well where our room was located. Breakfast which was included was wonderful. Great choices and lots of variety for everyone. Even champagne for mimosas at breakfast. There’s a restaurant for dinner, but it’s only buffet. Across the street from the hotel grounds is a great pizza restaurant “Portabella”where we ate two times. This hotel is not near the old city, it’s about a 10-15 min cab ride. Not many stores around the hotel. Great place to stay for a quite few days at the beach and if you have transportation."
Sep 2019,20,Needs Serious Upgrade Maintenance,"We have been coming to this hotel for 16 years and this is the first year we have considered not coming back. The apartments are in need of serious upgrades work, they are tired, mold on the walls, dated decor and in general just unkept. Its very disappointing as we love the location and hotel but the accommodation is letting it down now. Nothing has changed in 16 years !!!!"
Sep 2019,50,First Class Hotel,Truly the best accommodation we have ever stayed in.  Everything about the resort is 5* from the Reception Desk to the cleanliness not only in the apartment but all around the resort.  Lovely swimming pools.  Clean towels .  Free courtesy bus to the Strip and Old Town.  The breakfast is out of this world so much choice.  Our little boy loved his stay he cried when leaving.  Keep up the amazing standards .   Our paradise
Sep 2019,50,Weekend break,"Wow what a resort this was. Absolutely incredible, from arrival to departure. All staff were So friendly. Perfect location, beach, the bars service, food and accommodation. Would highly recommend to family friends and would definately be returning"
Sep 2019,40,last minute holiday,"Hotel classed as five star but would say this was now a four star.Needs some updating in places furniture and decor in rooms quite old fashioned and dark.Electric sockets in inaccessable places,no shaving mirror difficult to see in bathroom mirror because of wide sink unit and down lights.Food disappointing  for a five star hotel lack of choice and never hot enough.No hand saniitiizers anywhere.Hotel in ideal position for a lovely beach.Staff friendly and helpful.Arrived 5th Sept to find a lot of children of all ages at the hotel which made it quite noisy around the pool area and in the dining room at evening meal time.Was surprised that there was no dress code in the restaurant at night with quests in shorts and teeshirts looking as if they had just come off the beach."
Sep 2019,40,Amazing holiday,Location of hotel was amazing with private gate access to A lovely small beach. Customer service was top notch with staff going above and beyond to help out. Downfalls would be beds were 2 single beds put together and not tied in so not ideal with your partner also food was pretty poor. we was on a bed and breakfast and breakfast was nice but paid once for dinner and selection was really poor and over priced.
Sep 2019,50,Our nice vacation,"Very nice location.Very frendly staff.We enjoy every day being  in in the hotel ,out to the beach,on the swimming pool.The snake bar was very good as hamburger restaurant.The only think I will suggest for the future to look on the sleeping pillows, they are,good but not enough harder some times to have a good sleep on them,beside this everything was excelent."
Sep 2019,40,very good,"beautiful clean relaxing efficient beautiful clean relaxing efficient structure in a strategic position to visit the entire Algarve region, direct access to the beach, advisable for all types of customers. Available and efficient staff, even if the use of English is not at the top"
Sep 2019,40,Change the decor for 5 stars!,"The resort is absolutely stunning. Everything is at your fingertips there. The staff were lovely. My only complaint is about the room itself, and all the corridors too actually. The decor is horrendous. Beds are uncomfortable, as are the pillows. The rooms are not what you'd expect from a 5 star resort, but everything else about the place is 5 star."
Sep 2019,50,Love this hotel,"Have been here before, lovely location and staff are very welcoming. Stayed for our anniversary and were surprised by a bottle of bubbly and some treats being delivered to our suite, really made our day, thank you management.Rooms are older in style, no walk in showers ( jacuzzi bath in one of our bathrooms), very comfortable and the sea view suites are worth the extra - lovely large balconies and a great view. We dined at the buffet restaurant most nights - could not fault the selection, plenty of fresh salads, different hot dishes and good selection of cheeses, desserts, fresh fruit and ice cream. Breakfast buffet was excellent, as was lunchtime selection. You can eat inside or on the terrace and the staff are very attentive.  We also ate at the fish restaurant overlooking the beach and had a wonderful meal at a very reasonable price. Cannot fault the food or service.  Right on the lovely beach but a fair walk into Albufeira old town, but there is a free shuttle bus available.Pools are cleaned regularly, early morning, as is the rest of the hotel - spotless throughout. Plenty of sun loungers and grassy areas in shade and sun, so you can always find somewhere to relax.  Very happy with our stay and look forward to returning."
Sep 2019,50,Amazing hotel with breathtaking views and superb staff,"We were impressed by this hotel and it’s staff!We are just back from our amazing holiday - the Grand Real Santa Eulalia is a great resort with so much to do! Our studio was clean, comfortable (the bed was squeaky though) and well equipped, it was just a few minutes walk from the main hotel facilities. The views from the hotel are just spectacular, the buffet breakfast is tasty (could potentially be improved further by offering freshly made pancakes or omelettes), the pools are good (there are 3 pool areas as its a big resort) and our daughter loved going to the kids club - big thanks to the staff there (Claudia, Miguel, Jessica and the others, sorry, cannot remember all names but you are all great). Reception and waiting staff are very helpful and friendly also (our favourite was a middle aged gentleman at breakfast who called himself Jonny B Good, our daughter found him hilarious:) ). Very very pleasant stay!"
Sep 2019,50,to arrive and feel good,"The servred bufet food for Breakfast and Dinner was amazing, especially for Vegetarian! We would like to come again. Special thanks for the Brithday cake and champaigne, zhis was a nice surprise.It wolud be nice, when smoking is forbidden also in outside restaurant."
Sep 2019,50,Most beautiful hotel in the area!!,I’m currently staying here and think this hotel is absolutely wonderful. We were upgraded to a one apartment without even asking. The staff are soo nice and helpful. The views are breathtaking! Our room whilst traditional was a delight and colourful and very roomy and very comfortable for us. Definitely 5 star!! Would come back!!
Sep 2019,50,Comfortable stay at Algarve,"We stayed 10 days at GRSE and enjoyed it very much. The service was excellent and friendly, the buffets and meals extraordinary. We listend most of the evenings to the smooth music duo on the bar floor, much better than the often celebrated shows or animations.A special thank to Joåo of the Gym team. He gave an excellent class in Pilates and Gap."
Sep 2019,30,Extremely rude Front of House!,"I was treated appallingly at check-in! I was a bride checking in with my mother & friend the night before. The very rude & incompetent girl checking us in made me feel upset & embarrassed at how we were treated. She kept walking away when she didnt know what to do next! Asking me silly questions and when I didnt have a credit card on me she insisted my groom (who i wasnt to see until the wedding) would hv to come to show his instead of being lenient seeing as our wedding was being held there next day! Everything was a problem. She finally ""made an exception"" and used my debit card but at that point I had to walk away as I was so upset. Another ""guest"" rudely stood in front of us with her own issue with a staff member and shouted at us which added to my distress. I couldn't believe this was happening when i expected to be made feel welcome as any guest should especially a bride! Would not call this a 5 star hotel. Room service was ridic slow too.Very disappointed.."
Sep 2019,40,Great views ,"Hotel situated in great location to the public beach. Receptionist are helpful and friendly.  We stayed in room 331 though it's big it's dated and few damages in walls.We had views to the side of the garden, sea view and across to new town. There are costs for tea and coffee in the room and we only got a bottle of water on our arrival day. Shops are 10 mins walk away from the hotel left and right side from entrance gate to get milk and other snacks.  Bringing your own tea and coffee and dried milk from home would be advisable. Also advise to bring snacks from home as the exchange rate is very poor at present and costly in supermarkets.It cost to use the sun beds and umbrellas on the beach because it is not part of the hotel. Swimming pool is great for kids and adults to soak in after catching the sun.Breakfast has a great variety for all. We only took the option on bed and breakfast. There is great snack bars in the hotel, typical hotel prices.There is a fish restaurant which is great but costly because the fresh fish on the grill is priced according to weight. But tasty.Overall a quiet and family friendly hotel."
Sep 2019,50,A wonderful stay with friends,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Comfortable,  clean, friendly staff and a very comfortable bed. A few steps down on to the beach if preferred, but we were more than happy by the pool. A wonderful few days, just wished it had been for longer."
Sep 2019,50,Great hotel,"Had a fab time in this resort - attended a family wedding on the premises and stayed in one of the apartments - on arrival we were pleasantly surprised by an upgrade from a studio to a 1-bedroom apartment. In general we found the staff lovely, great location, would come again."
Sep 2019,50,Fantastic Family Holiday,"Myself,husband and 2 kids stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment that would have easily slept 6 if needed.The apartment was in excellent location,the pool was literally outside our door....the only thing was the apartment could do with paint inside and the wardrobe in main room had slight smell of must when opened.The sofa bed in living area has seen better days and was extremely uncomfortable to sleep on so new mattress needed on that.The staff overall were very helpful and kind,the only downfall was one evening we went to main hotel for the buffet style dinner,the staff failed to tell us that there was a separate kids station separated from the adults,kids inside..adults outside....our 2 kids ate noodles from The adult station as we presumed this was for them aswell and on leaving the member of staff charged my husband for 4 adults.....as the staff had not explained to us where kids station was I thought this to be very wrong.....but my husband said nothing and just paid...typical.The beach bar through the back gates is lovely for lunch and drinks...perfect location,basic but tasty food.The shuttle bus service from hotel into new and old town is great service.Overall ,we had a fabulous holiday and were very relaxed and comfortable,I would reccomend to any families looking for comfort and convenience as everything you need is in the resort....maybe just bring some of those nice lavender pouches to hang in wardrobes😎"
Sep 2019,10,Dreadful,"Horrific experience from start to finish. Mostly down to poor staff engagement i.e. none at all. Better places to stay nearby for a similar price where one might be treated better, particularly taking on board that this nasty experience was not exactly cheap."
Sep 2019,30,"Average breakfast , awful internet",Check in was awful! We arrived t 10 am check in was about 3 pm ! I asked them alittle earlier because of my child they told me room is not ready ! But I saw lots of guests after me came they had in time check in !and quick they got their room ! Reception told me every room are different  ! Awful food in restaurant! Breakfast fast was so average! I have been in lots of 5 stars hotels in the world but this hotel hadn’t good food and breakfast at all . Also I hadn’t at ll internet in my room . So many time I complain but it didn’t work out !
Sep 2019,40,Good faciities and food,"The hotel is well situated and appointed although, truth be told, it is beginning to look a little tired and frayed round the edges. However the rooms are large and comfortable. We had a seaview on the 2nd floor and it was excellent with a great view. The  bed was also enormous!We were on full board - which might have been a mistake as we were restricted to eating in the main restaurant. We selfishly would have liked to be served for the evening meal rather than have everything buffet style all the time.However such was the choice and quality of the food this was not a problem. To be fair, it is more a family hotel although as an older couple we were perfectly OK.All in all, we had a restful and pleasant time."
Sep 2019,50,Spotless Hotel - Great service and facilities,"Fantastic Hotel, genuinely spotless - You could eat off the floors! We stayed here in July having never been in Portugal before. We had one of the Studio apartments - south facing with a more private internal Garden and Pool Area so no early bird competition for sunbedsThe apartment was Spacious and generous - bit of an outfdated colour scheme to be honest but we didnt mind. A Large zip locked superking Bed and a pull out bed in the living room.The Main Hotel pool was well laid out - the pools are smaller but more intimate and easy to keep track of the kids.The Hotel is linked to the Beach with Beach side reasturant and bars - we honestly didn't leave the hotel much apart from trips to the Oldtown or Zoomarine.Honestly a fantastic hotel and friendly efficient service. My only gripe was the Kids club was located in the Basement Conference centre - probably needed more thought as was too out of sight. Additionally the Nights entertainment could have been more lively. We could hear other hotels and longed for the same but we are aware this is not how they market the place. There is a free bus service to the town during the day and there are great Restaurants just outside the gates, Pizza and Steak with Portuguese dishes.All in all a fantastic place and i hope this review gives others no doubt on which to choose."
Sep 2019,30,Not a 5 star hotel,We spent our holidays at Santa Eulalia in August 2019. The staff are very friendly and helpful but the hotel itself is in dire need of maintenance and is quite decadent. We stayed in the resort apartments and the lack of maintenance is notabley severe. It is a shame as we stayed at this hotel 10 yrs ago and it is clear that this hotel is not maintained properly. It is certainly not deserving of 5 stars. The employees deserve 5 stars but not the hotel itself.
Sep 2019,40,A pleasant stay but could have been more welcoming,"We got married here in 2009 and this hotel really had the wow factor. We returned this year for our ten year wedding anniversary with our two children who hadnt visited before. I feel the hotel is looking a little tired in places and could do with a revamp. The views and the beach are just unbelievable and are amazing to see again. We told the hotel we were there for a special occasion and were basically told by reception...'people get married here everyday and return all the time', so we were not made to feel like special guests who had returned to mark a special occasion. We tried to ask for complientary spa passes to use the jacuzzi but we were declined. Overall the room is  very comfy and the hotel is clean, Some of the staff could be friendlier and we would always return as it hold such special memories for us. Hopefully our next visit we would recieve a better service."
Sep 2019,50,Excellent Family Vacations,"Very good facillities.Services are great and employees sympathy are even better.Best Kids Club that I know. My daughter just love it!No need to leave the hotel, good food, amazing views, relaxed pools and beatiful beach..."
Sep 2019,40,Lovely Family Holiday,"Location next to the beach and sea are perfect and beautiful. Stayed here with our 2 children (6&8). Pools were perfect, staff lovely and couldn’t do enough for you. Rooms were fine, we stayed in the self catering part. The only critique is the pool area and rooms need updating. Bit tired."
Sep 2019,50,Short stay,"Just returned from 4 night stay at the grande Santa Eulalia in albufeira and was very happy with all the facilities on offer and really appreciated the ground floor garden room as it let us sit outside instead of on a balcony the room could benefit from updating. The staff were excellent will stay again if possible . room service for an early 4am breakfast was appreciated, thanks to all"
Aug 2019,50,5 stars,"5 stars! Great hotel, nice staff, excelente location and an amazing beach! The bedroom was always impeccable.   You can listen everyday to live music. They give information about all kind of programs you can do in the area. The bed it's very comfortable.Amazing!"
Aug 2019,50,Lovely hotel very relaxing will stay again,"This is a lovely hotel, the staff are wonderful and very helpful. Has 3 pools which arent big , one is saltwater and cold but very refreshing after a lot of sunbathingWe stayed b&b food was good with a wide choice, gets busy after 9 am..No issue or rush for sunbeds which is fantastic - fresh towels daily ..Rooms are really nice and spacious. we had no issues with noisy people or cars outside ( we overlooked the car park) had the option of a sea view but expensive.Hotel is approx 10 mins drive from the Old and New Town but theres a free bus that runs back and fwd ( last return is early) we always got a taxi back around 8 euros .Hard to think of any gripes but  if i was pushed - drinks next to the pool are very expensive 3.5 euros for a small pepsi 3 euros for a bottle of water will be back !The hotel is next to a lovely beach thats busy but not crowded"
Aug 2019,20,So so,"Room on the ground floor with an open balcony to some trees, not much of a view.The room felt dated, a bit cramped and not so secure as the sliding doors didn't seem to close properly. AC didn't work properly, bathroom felt dated for a 5 star hotel.Beds&&pillows weren't that comfortable.The best thing all in all was the breakfast."
Aug 2019,30,Mediocre.. wouldn't stay again,"Our stay here was okay at best. Our room felt very dated. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and were sort of bummed that upon check-in, our room wasn't finished being cleaned and set up. After we dropped our luggage the staff came back into our room and gave us water. Our minibar wasn't stocked. The toilet seat in the bathroom was broken, the shower drain was broken and my husband had to pry it out. There was mold in-between the tiles in the bathroom. The floors creaked really terribly, and the walls are very thin so we heard everyone all the time. The bed was very uncomfortable and the pillows were flat so we used our clothes as pillows for more support. The AC didn't work very well. We felt it wasn't worth what we had paid for."
Aug 2019,40,Relaxing Holiday,"A good hotel, with lots of internal facilities, Activities, and spacious.The location is good in one respect as it's away from all the Hustle & Bustle of Albufeira but there's nothing outside of the Hotel except 2 separate Restaurants. You need to taxi or use the shuttle bus to get to the New Town Or Old Town. The beach is a beautiful beach, but gets extremely busy in high season as there is a part for Hotel Guests, but it's also open to the public. We didn't use the beach, we preferred the pool area, which was quiet spacious and there are other Pools for the Apartments, but everyone seemingly choose the main pool of the hotel?The Hotel takes lots of guests in Hotel Rooms and Apartments, however this was over crowded at Breakfast. Queues for Breakfast went back all the way up the staircase every morning- so you need to be an early riser!!!Our room was a standard Classic Room, it was cleaned daily with fresh towels and the bed made in exceptional turn around times! The house keeping maid was an absolute gem!The Room it's self was very tired looking and dark because of the decor. (room 215) It did not rate as 5 star to me. The wooden furniture was marked, the upholstery was marked on the stools and the arm chair & just felt a little bit scruffy. It also did not look like the other rooms with floral curtains etc that i managed to catch a glimpse of.The camp bed that was supplied for my daughter had seen better days- call it more of a rack with the most saddest mattress I ever saw, although on mentioning this to reception this was sorted within the morning, and a new mattress replaced.The Hotel had a leaflet with all the activities and facilities listed which was given on arrival. This was helpful to find out what was going on and when. The Hotel and staff were all very pleasant and nothing was too much trouble. It's a very big hotel and apartment complex and well laid out. It has a good location if you want solitude from Albufeira it's self."
Aug 2019,50,A wonderful stay,"Very friendly service, different pool-locations, excellent food, all in all a very pleasant stay,a little bit too many people on the beach, it would be nice, if there were a separate place only for the hotel-guests"
Aug 2019,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa,Quality accommodation. Would definitely stay again. Own beach minutes from room. Plenty of pools. Not far from old town and new town. New town is within walking distance. Old town 7-8 euros in a taxi.
Aug 2019,40,Nice Hotel centrally located!,"Staff was helpful at checkin. Rooms are nice. The gift shop was helpful in assisting me with replacement swimsuit, coverup, and sunglasses as my suitcase never left Brussels. The concierge was super helpful in arranging guided experiences for me. I enjoyed them all. My only two complaints are small ones. The breakfast buffet needs set seating times for guests as the last minute stampede had a line of families and children backed up out the door and up the steps. The breakfast wasn’t great. When I had an early tour pickup scheduled, the staff in the dining room declined to give me any sort of breakfast to go. This seemed petty and unnecessary, I’m not a big eater and the front desk could easily verify my 7:30am ride to Faro for a Marine Wildlife tour. The hot water pots in the rooms are essential for me. The hot water pot in my room had such a short cord that I couldn’t plug it in without moving the table and setting the pot on the floor."
Aug 2019,50,Excellent facilities,"This is an excellent hotel for families - plenty of pools suitable for very young children through to adults, and plenty of sun-loungers and sun shades. We had an apartment with two bedrooms, two bathrooms a living room and kitchen plus a small balcony, which was ideal for 4 adults and a 4 year old. All kept spotlessly clean. Breakfasts were good and the buffet style dinners were adequate rather than special - we ate out on half of the days we were there. Hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful. There is access to the beach which was quite nice, but hire of loungers and sun shade at €10 a pop could be expensive (the beach does not belong to the hotel and the sun loungers are a private operation. We preferred the pools anyway as the 4 year old was more confident in the pool than the sea. The hotel offers a shuttle bus into Albufeira - lovely beach but VERY crowded and Albufeira itself is a bit tacky. If you have kids Zoomarine is a great day out  - combination of rides and marine creatures - dolphin shows, sea-lions, tropical birds etc. Kids need to be over 1M tall to go on some of the rides. Costs €29 for adults €21 for kids. Taxi about €25 each way."
Aug 2019,50,5 day stay with 5 year-old,"I was alone with my son and the place made it easy to entertain him all day with pools beach and the amazing kids club. The staff were amazing, the variety of food amazing, proximity to the beach, parking options. Great location and place to stay. Would definitely stay again."
Aug 2019,50,"Absolutely perfect, again....","Just stayed here for the 3rd time (same room requested and provided with each time) and the place is simply perfect in every way, i cannot fault anything. Thanks and Well done guys, keep up the great work!"
Aug 2019,50,Best Algarve resort ever,"Where can I start. There was a wide variety of food, clean apartment, amazing spa treatments, kids club that runs quite late into the evening, so many restaurants, bars and swimming pools we were spoilt for choice. Located right on the beach with beautiful views. Staff that will go over and above to make you feel welcome. All outstanding. Can't wait to come back."
Aug 2019,50,Summer Holiday,"Excellent Holiday. From checking in to leaving we had a great holiday. Its the people that work at the hotel that make this hotel so good. Special mention to the kids club staff my daughter loved going to ""holiday school"" as she called it. The restaurants and bars were very good especially Santa Eulalia and Pergula Burger Restaurants. Reception staff and also cleaning team very friendly and efficient. The General Manager runs a great hotel. Thank You we will return."
Aug 2019,40,A Pleasant Stay,"Apartment Clean, bright, cheery & spacious with a well equipped kitchenette.Food & DrinkBreakfast time is very busy but there is plenty on offer as at lunch and dinner including a kids section which is handy.We did full board on check-in you’re given vouchers to present at lunch and dinner however you can only use them in the main buffet restaurant which was disappointing.Complimentary drinking / tap water would have been a nice touch this is only available at breakfast which I think is a shame.PoolPlenty of sun loungers I saw little evidence of the towel reserving nonsense that you often get on holiday.The Staff Everyone that we encountered were friendly and polite.BeachIt gets extremely busy, access involves negotiating quite a few steps.The sea was freezing - not for the faint hearted!!Use of sun loungers / umbrella costs 15 euros for the day (I don’t believe this has anything to do with the hotel).Entertainment I didn’t notice much but I wasn’t particularly fussed. Overall we had a nice relaxing stay."
Aug 2019,50,Highly recommended for any type of holiday!,"As a family of 4, 2 girls aged 12 & 15 we decided against All inclusive this year but still wanted the luxury of a 5star resort. This is what we got even with self catering, something we haven’t done before. The holiday started as soon as we got there without waiting for our room which was a bonus!! We were in at 11.30am!! Previous reviews have knocked the apartments but ours must’ve been recently redecorated because we couldn’t fault it. Beds were comfortable, plenty of storage, 2 bathrooms and the cleaners came in every day. From reading a previous review, he suggested leaving a tip on the first day which I did, unfortunately we never had the same cleaner!! Typical!! But they all did the same so the first one got a bonus ha ha!! There are 2 pools one on each side with a smaller one for babies in the apartments area but beware they are cold! Then in the hotel there are 2 further pools one is slightly warmer (supposed to be heated). you can take your time going for sunbeds too, we would go down at 10.30 and there would be loads but would go from one pool to another and always find beds!! Not the typical 7/8am rush to put your towels to reserve... amazing!! You can put money on an account when arriving so you can make use of the pool bar which is a good idea too. My only 2 negatives would be the towels to hire are a bit worn and the decking is a bit shabby. If you drop anything between the large gaps ie a phone or room card (the gaps are that big) there’s no chance of retrieving them. But I will say the food we had was out of this world along with the drinks, more expensive but that’s to be expected in such a fabulous hotel. The staff were very polite and friendly who would always help and couldn’t do enough for you. If you need a supermarket, turn left it’s a 10 minute to a larger one with more choice and cheaper with additional shops and food outlets, turn right and there’s another for emergencies, less choice and more expensive but only 5 minutes away. We thoroughly enjoyed our holiday!"
Aug 2019,50,      2nd To None 2nd Time Round,"My wife and I came to Grand Real Hotel last year to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday 🎂🎉💏 and had a fantastic time. We came back this year with our four children (7, 9, 11, 13) and I can honestly say it was even better than the first time.After booking two seaview rooms, we emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to request the rooms were next to each other, with extra beds in each room for the younger children. We also requested to stay in the same room we had stayed last year (309) as it had fantastic views of the sea and beach. The hotel accommodated our request and it was all in place by the time we arrived... Happy days!As a surprise from the hotel, we had a bottle of Moët and Chandon with exotic fruits, chocolates and sweets waiting for us in each room when we arrived! We really appreciate this warm gesture from the hotel and it definitely set the tone of our holiday experience. Thanks to Ines and her wonderful team for the fantastic service and hospitality we recieved👍🏾😘🤗.We had booked the bed and breakfast option, but enquired with the hotel before arriving to ask if we could add dinner on for a few days. They said we could, so we purchased 5 vouchers for the main restaurant to use for either dinner or lunch on 5 days of our choosing. This was quite nice as we could choose when to eat in the hotel and when to eat out.Food at the hotel is the best that I have experienced. The buffet breakfast is excellent with lots of choice for adults and children, although I would love to see the hotel include pastel de nata (a popular Portuguese pastry) as part of their breakfast options in the future, yum yum 😋.The dinner varied every evening with different themed options, such as Algavarian, BBQ, Portuguese, Chef's Flavour and Latino, all very tasty, with lots of choice for the children as well. Drinks do not come free with lunch or dinner.There is a massive tennis court on the hotel premises (€10 to hire bats and balls), an excellent kids club with different daily activities including some trips outside the hotel, and a cash machine (charges €3.95 for withdrawals).The beach is close to the hotel and you can use your room key to access it via a private security gate.  Along the front of the beach there are a few restaurants with lovely sea views. The hotel also has a free shuttle bus into the old town and new town. There are a few restaurants near the hotel, and a 15 minute walk will get you to a Supermarche and Spar to stock up if you are self catering.Also, if you ever require a taxi, restaurant booking or excursion sorting out, the hotel reception team are always available to arrange this for you - they were really helpful making restaurant reservations for us when we wanted to eat out in the Old town and also helped us phone our airport transfer company when an issue arose.There are 3 pools onsite, a seawater pool which is cold, a normal pool which is heated and a toddlers pool. My wife absolutely loved the seawater pool, while the children preferred the heated pool.You have a choice of paying for food and drink items in the hotel on PAYG or you can choose the service of charging to the room. In this case your bank card will be requested for security purpose and an amount equal to €50/day will be taken from your card. Any unused amount will be refunded to your account. In conclusion, the customer service at Grande Real Santa Eulalia is excellent, the atmosphere is fantastic,  the food is delicious and your children will love the kids club.I highly recommend this hotel and I unquestionably plan to return again in the future.Obrigado to all members of staff on the reception at GRSEH 👍👏"
Aug 2019,50,July 2019 Stay,Our family stayed from end of July/August 2019 and previously in July 2017. We had a wonderful experience and every aspect of the stay (front-of-house and general services) were excellent. We stayed on a self-catering basis as it suited the needs of our young family and for this reason didn't review the restaurants but perhaps we will look at all-inclusive for future stays. Thanks again for making our holiday wonderful and relaxing and we look forward to seeing you next year.
Aug 2019,40,Not bad,"Overall, this hotel is very good. Love the breakfast/dinner buffet. Location is great. few mins walk to the beach.The only thing we don't like is the room/washroom. It's a bit old fashion though and not very clean."
Aug 2019,50,Loved it here!,"Had my wedding here, was amazing, everything down to the food, the service, the stunning views, it was my perfect day and more.Had a lovely two week stay, the staff are so welcoming and helpful. Breakfast is superb but does get busy after 9.30. Loved it and definitely will return"
Aug 2019,50,Great stay,"Stayed for 7 nights again this year. Fantastic location, lovely hotel and excellent staff. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff.We did half board for convienience and while the food is great, it is a buffet service. Next year I think we will just do b&b as it's nice to have a choice of eating in the other restaurants."
Aug 2019,40,Nice but a bit tired in places.....,Hotel is located the other side of old town cost you 8 euros in taxi. Last courtesy bus is at 630pm so you have no choice if want to go there. Some restaurant in walking distance but prefer old town. Hotel is gig with apartments located at front as you drive then main hotel behind these. You can use pools in all areas but stayed around main hotel.pools small circular 1 salt water the other fresh apparently heated but not sure about as took until afternoon for it to become comfortable enough. Plenty of loungers around pools so no need to panic about leaving towels down early. Stayed in suite which had 2 rooms & bathrooms of good size with 2 balconies. Cleanliness ok but showing signs of wear tear in places. Staff very friendly and dealt with any queries we had. Pool towels given out typical hotel quality and very used as you can imagine.  Breakfast choice very good and quality the same best go before 9.00am as it gets very busy after this. Had lunch in restaurant at beach which is below hotel and is there private section with loungers food not great. Used the gym which was of a good standard and choice of equipment. Overall nice but not sure if value as could do with a face lift in places.
Aug 2019,40,Aug 2019,This was my 5th time returning to Grande Real. The apartments need  redecorating as paint coming off walls and the beds and pillows are certainly not 5 star. Beds are rock hard and pillows very poor quality .
Aug 2019,50,Resort on the beach,This hotel has a private beach but family rooms are not seaview which is a disappointment.buffet has various dishes.All the staffs are courtious and helpful. Family rooms are quite big with kitchenett.
Aug 2019,50,"Fabulous Hotel, Staff and Facilities","Went in July, first time in Portugal. The hotel was spotless, the wide range of restaurant's, bars, pools, activities meant you didn't need to leave the hotel. There is access to the beach from the hotel. Our room had every home convenience we needed. Definitely going back."
Aug 2019,40,Very good resort with some reservations,"A very nice and clean resort with fantastic and friendly service and very good location. However, it is expensive for what you get (by any standard - I’m from the US and have travelled extensively). The food was great - no big complaints there. There are multiple pools, well kept, but they are all small round ones (ie. no lanes and they get crowded fast)."
Aug 2019,40,A great place to explore the Algarve,"The resort is at a beautiful place, in a small bay between the brown rocks. We booked an apartment, there was a nice place, but there would be some things to refurbish ... We booked only breakfast, it was tasty, but every day it was the same..."
Aug 2019,10,First day here and already a nightmare!,"We booked here for 5 days... Bad point 1-  cost 3000 euros for 2 adults and 3 kids for 5 days for half board only!!!!Bad point - 2:  We had to booked 2 rooms... and they couldn't guaranty to have them communicating.Bad point - 3: for this price, be prepared.... no private beach!!!! I'm will cost you 20 euros per day for one beach umbrella... We are five so I will let you calculate the additional cost for 5 daysBad point - 4: we decide to not pay the see beach... We fall back to the swimming pool....nothing more than 3 ridiculously little pool.. don't except to swim thereBad point - 5: you have to battle to find sunbeds... and absolutely no beach umbrella available! I let you imagine with 3 5, 8 and 8...  sunburn and sunstroke granted....And all this in my first hour here....With all the additional costs that will come for our meals due to the half board, all our drinks and all the paying activities at the kid club.... yes yes all the funny one are not free!!! This will be bad point- 6!I'll let you know the rest during our stay... if we don't evade before that....Just a suggestion, book at the Club Med instead... more expensive at the beginning but everything is included!!!!"
Aug 2019,50,Self catering apartment bliss!,One bed apartment for a family of four had me worried prior to arrival but large double room with a single and a double in the lounge dining area was generous in size and never left us feeling cramped. Great hotel facilities with range of bars and pools - beach access from hotel and a few nice restaurants in walking distance - less than 10euros to taxi it into Oldtown and Newtown a 10minute walk. Personally I’d avoid both and do a much calmer relaxed Ochoa del Acqua nearby.
Aug 2019,40,6 Days Break to Portugal,"I visited this hotel with my best friend for 6 day break from 18th July-24th July.I have to say the hospitality we recieved from the staff was amazing. Portugese people uin general are SO SO SO nice. We got there abit early and went to check in, we paid for a standard view but th guy at the desk put us in a side view instead which had the garden view and some sea too which was nice, considering we didnt even pay for the sea view.  So i thought that was really nice. We couldnt go in our room so we asked the hotel conceirge about what he recommended for lunch as we were starving and we were shocked to know this hotel had about 5 resturants. We ended up eating at the resturant near the beach. The snack resturant. It was great and great service. Then we were shocked to see how close the beach was. Literally our hotel was on the beach. Like 10 secs away! Beach was busy but was amazing. Sea was just amazing!! Then we went back and went to our room. To be honest, the room does need updating. Its very clean and nice but the beds were a little creaky. Also, the pool was very cold. If it was heated that would be AMAZING. But because the staff were so nice, we didnt mind. Then we decided to go down and speak to the concierge about dinner. I have to give recognition to JEROME, the concierge, he was just fantastic. Every resturant he recommended was AMAZING. We were sad we didnt get a chance to say bye! So please send our thank yous to him. I hope he can see this message! Breakfast Buffet was good lots of variety and very tasty, however i feel they  should make it bigger because every morning there were SOOO many people so you would get abit overwhlemed. Also the omlette station wasnt very clear either. I think that could be improved. Overall i was very happy with this Hotel and my stay. Food was amazing. We had the seafood resturant (recommended by JEROME) one night and it was AMAZING!!!! I would recommend. I think it was called Oura...near the beach. We also had the Hamburger one Pergula..i think...that was just OUT OF THIS WORLD, best burgers ever. Honestly the only thing I would say is that the hotel rooms need to be updated a little and the breakfast hall should be extended. But other than that, please go and visit this hotel. I dont think you will be disappointed. I would 100% go back!!!"
Aug 2019,40,Summer Holidays,"Relaxing, family holiday. Beds and pillows need replaced. Rooms need upgraded as do the apartments. They are in real Portugese style but are outdated now.John the baggage/towel attendant was very attentive and very pleasant - nothing was ever too much!"
Jul 2019,50,"Excellent, again. ","I reviewed this hotel last year after visiting for the first time. We’re just back from a second trip. We requested and got the same apartment- they did well to give us this and we were very happy they could as it was ideal last year. Staff are very accommodating. Food is mostly excellent. Breakfast is best. Dinner is overkill and not as good, but it is worth it for a long slow meal with free wine (voucher given on check in). Pools are great, gym each morning is very quiet, small but well equipped. Beach is next door and amazing, especially early morning. We’ll be back next year. A couple of things I hope the hotel can answer, which are of slight concern for next year and beyond. All the wood across the resort is rotten and in need of repair. Signs, decking, verandas all falling apart... Tiles on the pool floor are chipped or missing and hurt when you catch your foot on them. Cobbles on the paths are missing, so there are holes in the road. The whole place needs ‘a lick of paint’. Had this been our first visit we might not have rated so highly based on these flaws, but knowing how perfect it was last year, we overlooked them and the stay was again almost perfect this year. I hope the hotel has a plan to fix these issues in the off season, prior to next summer. If not they will certainly create a shabby and tired resort by next year. 10/10 last year. 8.5 this year. As for comments regarding it not/being a five star. It is, clearly. It isn’t the ritz or savoy but in Europe terms and in a hotel of this scale, it is five star. It is noticeably better than similar resorts that are four star. This could change if the problems above aren’t addressed."
Jul 2019,40,Lovely Propery .Everything we required with 2 kids,Lovely hotel in lovely location.Plenty of pools and beach to choose from.A couple of good restaurants nearby.Good service.Rooms cleaned to a high standard everyday.No problem getting beds by pools .Didn't like Albufeira as a bit manic for kids but if you turn right when you come out of hotel there is a lovely beachside place called Olhios de Augua that is worth a visit.All in all we had a great holiday.
Jul 2019,50,Second visit ,"I love this hotel, it is exactly what you want, the kids have a fantastic time nothing is too much for the staff and the hotel are so accommodating, the spa is a real treat and gym is comfortable.... I couldn't fault it. Thank you so much for a great holiday!"
Jul 2019,40,The perfect family beach holiday!,"Lovely hotel with lots to do!Tricky to locate, but its position on the coast and proximity to the beach and shops is perfect. Ample parking available ... and it feels very safe.Reception team was warm and welcoming. Check-in easy and fuss-free. Concierge available but plenty of information provided throughout the hotel. Room spacious, especially for our baby and pram (we were given a disabled persons room). They also kitted it out with a cot as per our request. Thank you! The room was clean and comfortable. A few maintenance bits to take care of, but nothing standing out as an eyesore. Fridge and kettle provided. TV reception and channel options excellent.  Wifi availability, access and speed throughout the entire hotel was very impressive, even at the pool.Pools, activities and beach no more than a hop, skip and a jump. Very satisfied! Pools were very well maintained and clean. Pool/Beach towels provided ... and even though they seem to have run out on day 1 the problem was rectified by day 2. Ample deck chairs available ... and what a pleasure not to have to reserve or wrestle guests for space.Beach clean and ... well, beautiful! Located within a small cove, it feels private and intimate yet expansive enough for a morning jog or walk.Hotel offers several restaurant options. We tried the Burger joint (Pergula) as a take away in our room ... on our balcony ... overlooking the sea. Recommendation - Bacalhau Burger - big yum!The main hotel restaurant serves a buffet every evening. Lovely atmosphere and wide variety of food options. But personally at Eur 35 per head, I'd rather eat down at the Atlantico Restaurant / Bar overlooking the beach. Simple food; decent quality; good prices ... and chilled live music after 5pm.Breakfasts were fab! A smorgasbord to suit almost any morning preference. PS: Coffee outstanding - thank you Nespresso!""Realito"" kids club a great option (and the staff is full of youthful energy). Small negatives - housekeeping inconsistent and slow. We never knew when the room would be serviced - day 1 - 11am, day 2 - 4pm, etc ... and perhaps the odd smile and greeting? The only staff members who didn't. The gym and spa lovely, but the equipment getting old and requiring some maintenance.This is the perfect place for a family with kids. Romantic couples be warned - my child might fling a french fry into your Aperol!"
Jul 2019,50,The perfect family vacation,"We had the perfect family holiday,My wife and I managed to relax while our 16 month old had a blast running around and playing, the hotel facilities are great, the proximity to the beach, the pools, the restaurants and bars, everything was simply good, the studio we stayed in was also well equipped and the food at the Santa Eulalia and atlantico was great. We will definitely be back"
Jul 2019,10,Greedy,"We checked in for two nights, we were working in the area. After one night we were called away by our office. Reception said we would still have to pay for the second night. At over 200 Euros a night we felt this was excessive greed."
Jul 2019,50,First trip to Portugal,"Absolutely fantastic time here, great location lovely hotel, nice spacious rooms.Probably the best kids club I’ve ever seen with friendly staff and great activities open until 10 pm which gave us a couple of hours an evening of grown up time which was perfect."
Jul 2019,30,It was a nice trip,Not a real 5 Stars hotel. Food should be better. A lot of guest don't known thats Children should Not Run the whole time through dishes. Rooms are  realy Good and  employes do a Good job. But a hotel should give advices to guests if they don't behave
Jul 2019,50,Perfect hotel in the most perfect spot - would go there anytime again!,"Nice hotel with an incredible seaview and only a short walk away from the marvellous beach. The main pools are often crowded, but there's the side pools as well. Variety of restaurants available and a good snack bar for lighter meals. In our case, the app. was spacious enough for our family of 4, cleaned daily and the towels are changed on a daily basis. Not to forget the wonderful Kids Club, our boys loved it and the team there."
Jul 2019,50,Great hotel,"Myself and my husband and our daughter stayed here for 4 nights recently. The hotel is beautiful set in its own gated complex. We had a room with a big balcony & sea view and the views day and night were just beautiful. The room itself was plenty big enough but could do with a little overhaul, nothing major just little things you wouldn't expect to see in a 5 star hotel.  The pools are perfect size and temperature. We had the buffet breakfast every morning and it was perfect, plenty to choose from. We ate in the fish restaurant 1 night and it was lovely, staff v friendly. We ate in the buffet restaurant on the last night & we didn't think it was great & a bit pricey. Its a 5 star hotel so you pay 5 star prices for everything even down to a glass of wine, €6 by the pool. Overall we had a lovely stay in a beautiful hotel with stunning views."
Jul 2019,20,Disappointing 5* promise.,"We chose the hotel for its proximity to the beach.  Unfortunately the hotel is not really a 5* it requires a proper renovation, cracks on the walls, room decor, amenities. We had asked for a room with a view, 1st room we had a large tree in front of the room. After discussing with front desk they found us a second room with promise of another room on the second floor.  Next day we saw the second floor room and decided its best to stay where we were. Staff at the hotel in general are kind, smiling and very helpful.  Room service tax is incredibly expensive at 5 euros a run. Kids club staff very kind but games needing to be renewed and activities need to be made a little more entertaining.  We had breakfast which after the 2nd day we were bored. Lots of it but not different enough. Overall very little value for money."
Jul 2019,30,Here at the moment,"This is about my 12th visit to this hotel. Sadly, this is not the 5* it was. I’ll list my gripes in no particular orderFirst room smelled of sewer so we were moved. Why put guests in the apartment Towels are shocking. Thrown better away. We have mostly used the pool at the apartments and the pool area has never been cleaned. Dirty sticky tables. Only today has the bar been opened and there are no ice creams Dirty ashtrays left on tables by the bar and it’s only just opened today! NO pans in the apartment if you wanted to cook anything Only 2 chairs on the patio. Glass has been left outside apartment 411 since we have been here. Until today we have had no waiter service around the pool. This is the height of the season and every thing should be spot on. Painfully slow service in the lobby bar in the evening. Hopefully things will get improve as the week goes on."
Jul 2019,30,Not a 5 star resort,"The plus was the private beach of the resort even though I left with a big pincushion on my leg and after returning to my country I treat it local and with oral antibiotics. I do not know what bite me, but it certainly happened in the water of the ocean or on the beach. The beach umbrellas were so small...and of course you had to pay for it.It was also a plus, the breakfast, which was very varied (eggs prepared in 4 ways, many fruits and pastries, sausages, cheese, and a fresh orange juice). The minus were: the unprepared staff at the reception, the apartment (458) had old furniture and the closet in the bedroom smelled bad and nothing could be stored there. On the other hand, daily and thorough cleaning was done. The kitchen was fully equipped and it would have been note 10 if there was a dishwashing detergent and also a paper towel roll (we bought  and left them there to help other customers).Another plus was the free shuttle to Albufeira, old city and beach.Per total, it is not a 5 star resort."
Jul 2019,40,Nice relaxing hotel close to the beach.,"a really nice hotel, close to a lovely beach. Food expensive in the hotel and drinks. £4.50 a small beer cocktails £8 a sandwich £8 but everything else was fine. Cheaper restaurants to eat directly outside hotel and off to the left."
Jul 2019,30,More style than substance,"We were allocated a one bedroom apartment in this hotel after Jet2 Holidays overbooked our original hotel. Apartment 529 was clean, spacious and overall, very comfortable. The maid every day kept the place immaculate.There was a degree of noise until the early hours from the adjacent hotel but there's not a lot the hotel can do about that. We were on half board so we had to eat breakfast and dinner in the main restaurant most nights. This is chaotic to say the least!The buffet style layout is concentrated in one corner of the restaurant. The area is far too small for the amount of people using it. Particularly when people have to carry hot coffee etc through the throng of people all clamouring for their breakfast!There were children running everywhere on our first couple of nights and one child was even riding a bicycle! Certainly didn't make for a relaxing evening meal!When we complained to management about the potential danger this was causing, we were told that "" it was the children's holiday as well"" and there was nothing they could do! Keep in mind that this is supposed to be a 5 STAR HOTEL!The food in the restaurant seemed to be varied enough but it was very rarely ever hot. In fact, I think there was only 1 night when I'd say it was acceptable. I did ask to speak to a manager about this after yet another cold dinner but I was told that they had left for the evening. The promise of a call the next day was obviously also forgotten! They also serve dinner outside 3 nights a week. This certainly didn't help regarding the temperature of the food and in some cases, it was so dark outside that it was impossible to read the minute cards that were set beside each dish to explain what they were. Incredibly frustrating!Also, the entire dessert area was completely uncovered. Not ideal when you have bats, seagulls and various insects flying overhead as it came up to sunset! We did try the burger restaurant one evening in the hope of a hot meal. I have to say that the food was actually excellent but the service was nonexistent!The hotel is situated on a stunning beach which is available or use to the guests of the hotel and the general public. We used this on several occasions and it never got so busy that it was uncomfortable. Overall, this hotel has so much potential but the restaurant facilities, standard of service and particularly the ongoing food temperature issues really need some work to get them up to 5 star standard."
Jul 2019,30,Holiday,We have been to this hotel about 8 times but feel this year the hotel seemed to be cutting corners the bars near the pools were not open and it looked as though you do with spending some money  cleaning up we do love the quietness of the second pool but feel the area was not as clean as it used to be you also don’t have any loyalty for customers who return and the last bus at 6.30 is too early what happened the one after 7 you finally get a bigger bus but nobody on it Not really 5 star
Jul 2019,40,Holiday at the Grande,"This place is an amazing hotel with excellent staff. We returned home to England today and bring with us some great memories. First of all, the hotel is really beautiful and is next to an idyllic beach setting. The staff are really kind ""Sampatico/ca'. They helped me learn some Portuguese during our staff. Ana Rita, Rafaela, Mariana, Georji, Anesh and Rubin were all amazing!!! A credit to the Portuguese people. The rooms were nice and tidy but it was the people who made this holiday special.ThanksTo you allDarren"
Jul 2019,50,Wonderful vacation,Absolutely beautiful resort. Pictures do not do it justice. Very friendly staff. Apartments are great for a family especially with two bathrooms. The breakfast buffet was excellent and their burger restaurant was great too.
Jul 2019,50,Location. Location. Location!,We were here last September and decided to revisit. Special location. Fantastic staff. So friendly. Shout out to Mario who always came over to us at breakfast and made us feel so welcome. A minutes walk to beautiful beach. Atlantico Restaurant great for brunch / lunch. Falésia pool bar. Great service. Friendly staff. Fantastic sea view room. Booked to come back again this September and can’t wait. Their birthday treat was so special. Muito obrigado.
Jul 2019,10,2 Star Hotel,"Beautiful venue hotel and resort. Poor management and service, except for the bar and resturaunt staff they were on form this time. This is my second visit to this resort. In 2017 i had a horrible experience and was given a free stay, i figured since they have had 2 years to improve it would be different but its not. Got woken up to construction underneath my suite this morning."
Jul 2019,20,Not Grande,"Just arrived but I will pass comment. I have been coming to Albufeira now for 12 years and often called in past this hotel since it has a nice bar and restaurant at beach. I’ve never had more than brunch but excellent. Stayed in the apartments around ten years ago and it was a bit jaded but I have always admired the hotel, it’s entrance, ambience so promising. Sold our property and a chance available to have three days at the main hotel, sea view room bed and breakfast. We must have the first sea view room and looks over the car park to the sea, no big issue, introductory blurb offered us a free upgrade if available, surprise surprise not available. Room very disappointing, no way five star, poor value for money, musty smell, and kettle will have to be on the floor to plug - in  I hope it gets betterVery disappointed"
Jul 2019,40,Excellent service but not 5 star accommodation,"We stayed in a one bedroom apartment which, although spacious and well equipped, was not five star - equivalent to 2-3 star apartments in other countries.  What made the hotel stand out was the level of service.   The staff were lovely and helpful and the hotel itself was immaculate. Our children loved the kids club in the morning and afternoons by the pool.  We ate at various restaurants in the hotel three times and the food was very good.  Drinks are overpriced and the ATM in the hotel lobby is a rip off.  The nearby beach is a lovely change from the small hotel pools."
Jul 2019,10,BAD ALL INCLUSIVE!,"good evening,we arrived on 2/7 we arrived for our honeymoon trip that our agency had specified in the booking (I read the email). to be honest, having traveled a lot, we found ourselves very badly.on our arrival (at two o'clock in the morning due to the scandalous TAP flight policy), the tour operator (king holiday) had asked us to at least find us a cold dinner. also because we were with two children. anything. we had to order two cheap sandwiches with chips (in an envelope) paid € 35, although we had not even used the half-board voucher. poor food for lunch and dinner, not from an international 5-star hotel for sure! your waiters even once did not want us to sit at the table because having bought a bottle of water in the box 5 minutes before we didn't have to buy it .... I had to yell in English with the head maid to tell her to let me talk to the manager . in life I deal with marketing and hotel reviews. I will translate your worst review in all languages. a hotel aimed only at gain (€ 3.50 per 75 ml of water). € 3 two coffees ... if we asked a question or spoke in English or were told: ""I don't understand"". this is the phrase of everyone, from the reception, to the spa, to the waiters, bar always closed in the Piacina adjacent to our apartment (503), always, even in the morning.not even a bottle of sparkling wine in the room to wish us a good honeymoon ... we in Italy are so used to it, we have been everywhere, I have traveled 47 countries for work, I did not expect a 5-star international in Algarve a reception, situations and such poor attitudes. I highly recommend changing jobs. read the other reviews because they are not good at all and I will translate this in all languages. ps if you charge us for 4 people, the towels in the room must be 4, both from the face, from the shower, and from the bidet. but I understand that cleanliness does not belong to you."
Jul 2019,40,"Great Beach, close to town, super clean,family friendly.","My family spent 4 nights here and enjoyed the pools and beach.  We stayed in for!an apartment with our 3 kids (one infant included) and it was baby friendly as bit of a hike.The place is super clean, easy beach access and staff were very helpful. We actually needed a doctor for my son who developed a bad ear ache and the front desk arranged for a doctor to visit our apartment lwithin 1 hour of calling them!  Amazing! We had a car and parking was a breeze.  Albufeira old town was a 7 minute drive away - we parked in a parking garage in Estacionamento 5 which is a perfect location for parking when visiting especially at night.  Lots of night life - family friendly!   1 euro per hour.I’d give the resort 5 stars if it weren’t so expensive...I found it overpriced for what you get especially the meals/restaurants ($20 euro per person for breakfast)  The beach is a bit of a hike from the apartments - fine for adults but too far for 3 small kids to walk. I’d definitely stay again but would ask to stay closer to the beach and plan better around meals.Overall a great experience!"
Jul 2019,20,Overrated,"firstly i received a email upon my return to participate in a survey from the hotel about its service so happily completed it and they posted it on trip advisor which i have deleted as i was mislead.firstly this is not a 5* star resort , it needs attention and money spending on it to bring it back to a level i’m sure its been in the past and staff need to learn what customer service is !! , not all as When we arrived Jorge who took our cases to the room was always smiling and spoke every time we saw him he could learn others .room was large and spacious although in need of an update , kettle in room but had to stand it on the floor when i use as no sockets near were it’s located , telephone in room didn’t work and took 3days and for me to take it to reception to get someone to fix it , again not the service we expected .breakfast was ok with plenty of choice .drinks and snacks during day expensive around the pool entertainment staff during the day just seem to take over the pool area for hours on end to place an aqua ball which people get in and then it’s inflated to walk on water which is charged for , obviously pool not used whilst this is going on then followed by aqua fit with clueless staff in charge, this is most days.entertainment on an evening is poor so not much going on in such a large hotel which is missing as not much around hotel and would be welcomed.Atlantic restaurant overlooks the beach and is also open to public from beach , staff are rude and we were asked to move tables as we were on a large table and only two of us but no alternative table offered even tho we were hotel guests and it’s part of the hotel !! also steps from here to beach are in a poor state of repair and dangerous .overpriced drinks and food within the hotel and it lets itself down , paying for 5* but not getting the service nor the hotel .overall grounds kept well but need a refurbishment and customer training , i did speak to reception staff a few times however the understanding of english is poor ( better then my language skills tho ) but it should be better .hopefully i won’t see a standard response from hotel about this review as i did mention some of this whilst i was there and nothing was done or said so i don’t want patronising now ."
Jul 2019,40,Great Holiday,"We had a great stay at the hotel, which is in a great location. The restaurants are nice and there are many things to do and places to eat, outside of, but close to, the hotel complex. The beach is extremely close to hotel with cafes and resturants over looking it."
Jul 2019,50,Amazing Resort,I would definitely come back. The resort is amazing. Several activities. Well located. Amazing staff. Room very clean. Good amenities. Studio with kitchen was great. Was able to cook breakfast in the room.
Jul 2019,50,First time in Portugal. Excellent hotel look forward too returning in the future,"My partner and I arrived here on the 2nd of July and it did not disappoint. A little bit of paradise. As we stepped out of our coach we were met by staff who gave us a lovely warm welcome and took our luggage for us. Check in was quick and we were gave a welcome package with information about the hotel facilities,the shuttle bus times into the new and old town,and things we could do around Portugal. Our room was very nice,clean,very large comfortable bed,and had all the facilities we would need throughout our stay. The pool area was great,lots of beds. Pool was very cold tho so we didnt use it much. Views were amazing from all around the hotel. Bars all very good. Large beer £3 cocktails £6. We were breakfast only and couldn't fault it. Access to the beach and the beach itself were fantastic. Plenty of watersports etc. We did the jetskiings and really enjoyed it. Photos from it are so good. We loved the little beach bar. The views from it was stunning. Spa was excellent. I had a massage,the best I've ever had then I had a wash and blowdry before heading out that night. Taxis always sitting outside the hotel. Few euro into the town. 5 mins away (new town) old town about 10 minutes away. We had to leave at 7am on our last day for the airport,the hotel organised room service for us to have our breakfast which was so lovely. We were very sad to leave and will definitely be back again in the future as will lots of our family and friends after seeing our photographs and hearing us rave about it. Thank you grande real santa eulalia"
Jul 2019,40,Good 5* hotel,"- kids club: fantastic, open 12hours a days, excellent shows, kindhearted young people, probably the best I have ever seen, absolutely recommend. just fitness lessons are happening in cold swimming pool, might be in a warmer- room: very clean, fantastic everyday service, I would say 4* impression of the room, wifi and TV working very well, just a but stinky outside 541 apartment and noisy bin collection lorries around midnight from next door hotel every day !- breakfast: very good english breakfast, just sausages are not high quality-you should really change it, lack of vegetables but on the other hand really a lot of fruit, 3 coffe machines which is fantastic, but try to pay just a few more euros for slightly higher quality coffee bins, lack of filtered coffee that is more suitable for breakfast especially in 5*, big variety of juices but some of them are not 100% fruit or if they are they dont taste the best but not worst - its worth to spend few more money on it -lunch: the best meal in this hotel: FANTASTIC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no problem at all, BBQ-dinner: very good variety, some of the meals are super high quality, some low quality, depends on the day, sometimes a lot of dishes with seafood - be careful if you are alergic. large beer 4.5euro, apple juice 3euro, bottle of wine 20euro, staf polite and prompt-acces to the beach fantastic-very good gym- free parking - enough spaces- extremenly helpful polite staff - thank you !!!- towels pool service is great-heated main pool - 25 degrees, i think number of seats is so so..almoust ok :-)- burger restaurant very goood, the hotel i think should improve in deserts - not bad but not 5star hotel deserts (maybe im spoiled :-)  - seafood restaurant: havent tried because we wanted to try our last day but it was closed, still have 2 spare vouchers :-)- on 5* hotel beach you have to pay for seats and umbrella (10 euro) - it doest seems like good advertisiment  - sorry guys - its not just question of moneyconclusion: very good hotel, i would say regarding fantastic kids club, hotel souroundings and location, and overall impresion its 5 star hotel, variety of food is 5 star as well but quality of some ingredients and taste of some prepared meals is 4 star. we paid 2450 euro for one week as ""family program""....I would say real cost  would be around 2000-2100 euro. I think I might recomment this hotel and if i get some mild discount we might be thinking about coming back next year."
Jul 2019,20,Not even a 4 star hotel if not that well located,"It’s been 6 years now that I am coming each summer to grande real santa Eulália, mainly because of the hotel good amenities for children. Nevertheless, I am obliged to say it will be my last venue as this hotel is very poorly managed (as many unfortunately) and better deserves a 3 star rating than a 5, i can guarantee anyone. No or very few refurbishment, basic amenities ( outdoor toilets) not functioning,young summer employees not trained at all, hotel management responsibles are invisible and not reachable, kids clubs basic and not well organized.Poor quality food at restaurant, the list could be longer.If you are expecting a minimum basic service of a normal 4 star hotel ( the hotel is supposed to be a 5 star’s one) , dont come. You will be hugely disappointed.Big issue with hotel management and price/ quality positioning Stay of July 2019"
Jul 2019,50,Great stay,"Lovely stay, great staff, clean rooms, good WiFi connectionSeafood and beach restaurant next to it were delicious.Nice pool areas - preferred the quieter ones than the main one.Would recommend to anyone!"
Jul 2019,30,"Great grounds and amazing staff, but awfull old rooms with ants and very poor WiFi","The grounds are beautiful. Staff were friendly and welcoming.WiFi - non existent, poor and disconnected every 10-20 minutes.Room facilities - very little kitchen, old furniture and decor, room even smelled old. Room also had ants running everywhere - on table, kitchen top etc. Awful experience."
Jul 2019,50,Excellent quality service and ambience,2nd time we have stayed here and on both occasions outstanding!!! We stayed in apartment this time with our kids and equally as good as the hotel... only 1 min walk to lobby... also excellent Italian across road from main entrance which does takeaways handy for relaxing on terrace!!
Jul 2019,40,Five star location but not five star hotel. The property is beautiful however some rooms need to be updated.,Love the location but hotel could use some updating. Service is great but some information they gave me was incorrect. Restaurant by pool needs more variety and fish restaurant was too expensive. We keep coming back mostly due to the location right on the beach!
Jul 2019,50,relaxing beach vacation,I've been to many beaches. The one near this hotel was perfect. The hotel caters to families. It's ok for a friends trip but not for couples. I stayed in an apartment which was further from the beach but still walking distance. Housekeeping cleaned our dishes. Restaurant food was delicious.
Jul 2019,50,fantastic hotel we were well looked after,"Apartment had everything and was cleaned daily, the reception staff spoke good English and went out of their way to help us book trips sort transport etc,They have staff to take you and your luggage to your rooms and bring you irons etc.only complaint no supermarket or basic for sale at hotel like milk and bread and indoor pool was extra ."
Jul 2019,50,Well worth a stay,"We stayed in an apartment for 10 nights and couldn’t have faulted the cleanliness and general maintenance and upkeep of the resort. There’s nice restaurants and a bar with several pools dotted around. The hotel leads onto a beach which is beautiful and not overcrowded. All staff were extremely helpful and professional and our apartment was cleaned daily. There’s a free bus shuttle into the old and new town until approximately 18.30 each day, but after this time we got a taxi a few times which was around €8. Although we are a mature couple, we could certainly see the attraction for families to the resort. Definitely recommend a stay."
Jul 2019,40,Family holiday.,Dont get me wrong the hotel is absoutle  beautiful but is in a poor location for families.  It's to expensive to eat in so each night took a 20 minute walk into the strip or a 10 euro taxi into the old town which adds up when your with a family. The pool area near out apartments but the snack bar wasnt open once so it also ment packing up at the pool and more walking involed. The rooms are spotless the maids do an outstanding job infact to good of a job glad I've tried this hotel but would not stay again
Jul 2019,50,Great Location and wonderful views,The staff are amazing so friendly. Nice quiet resort on a lovely beach. Quite a lot of steps so not for the less mobile. Not many shops for everyday needs but Albufeira not too far away by bus or taxi.
Jul 2019,50,5 Star Hotel,Real Santa Eulalia is a great resort for family vacation at the algarve.Very close to the Beachand very good service and welcoming and friendly atmosphere.Appreciated very much the diverse swimmingpools.
Jul 2019,40,Five star ??,"Ive been to this hotel twice now. I loved it the first time and would have given it five stars. I went again last year and feel its dropped off the Five star rating.  It just needed some attention to detail in some areas.I also had a issue with what i totally believe was a theft in our room, it was handled with no resolve in my opinion.I will give the breakfast five stars as it’s wonderful, everything was lovely, fresh omelettes made to order each morning, everything replenished and no waiting for anything.They could do with more bed outside in the pool area, word to the wise....don’t leave you bed for too long as people are very cheeky last year and pinched mine whilst I was at first aid with my son!! Have to say the first aid was superb at the hotel. Hotel does have a good feel about it, its very clean, friendly staff.  Have a shuttle bus into the Old Town every evening. Hotel has a beautiful setting, restaurant below on way beach  is great too."
Jul 2019,20,Not even close to a 5* hotel,"The grounds are beautiful and hotel is very close to the beach. Staff are friendly and helpful.The rooms are awful - we are staying in a 1 bed apartment which is full of ants, with very tired decor and old towels/bath robes, broken kettle and the room does not even have tea/coffee. Overall the accommodation is 3* at best and we won't be staying here again.Restaurant prices are however truly 5* with 32 euro per person for a buffet dinner. You can have great 3 course dinner with sangria/beer for less money in the nearby authentic Portuguese restaurants instead."
Jul 2019,50,Great stay,"Had a great time at this 5 star resort . Great food , service and an excellent beach . The staff was very helpfull with a great buffet breakfast  .courteous staff . good outdoor sitout .. Would surely comeback"
Jun 2019,30,Good Hotel but room for improvement in places,"First thing to point out is that we had a great stay at this hotel. I would stay here again but there are a few things that are worth pointing out. I have split my overall comments into “Pros” and “Cons” to make it easy to read. ProsReally friendly staff.Good kids clubs (with amazing staff).Spacious rooms (we had a suite room in the hotel which was excellent for families).Comfortable beds.Very good breakfast buffet.Nice outdoor pool areas (see cons).Situated on a beautiful beach (hire of sunbeds were separate from hotel).Lovely indoor pool area with sauna and steam room (see cons).Nice spacious lobby area with bar.Good value for a “5 star” hotel (but I would suggest it was a solid 4 star instead).Adjacent restaurants (out with the hotel) were decent. ConsIt doesn’t “feel” like a 5 star hotel compared to others which isn’t necessarily an issue as it is relatively cheaper.Overall the place is beginning to look a bit “tired” – i.e. external walls needing plastered, letters and numbers for floors and rooms are missing, internal decoration also needing freshened up.The place felt like it was coming to the end of a refurbishment cycle and needed the next one within the next 12 to 24 months.Never saw the outdoor pool area being cleaned as thoroughly they do in other resorts – i.e. some sun loungers sometimes had the odd seagull dropping on them in the morning, the grills around the pool perimeters weren’t as clean as other pools. Decking areas around pools probably need replaced as they are beginning to get worn out.General upkeep and maintenance is not as good as other 4 and 5 star hotels I have stayed in.Larger pools were too cold when we visited.The indoor Spa area is lovely but access and pricing is all over the place. For example the sauna & steam room are 10 euros for an hour, with the use of the indoor pool an additional 20 per hour, and none of these are free with a spa treatment?????They insist on wearing swimming caps in the pool which is actually quite annoying (is this the 1980s?).This is worth comparing to the Crowne Plaza in Vilamoura - they charge guests 10 euros for the day to access indoor pools, sauna and steam room which are even better than this one.The indoor pools at this hotel were pretty dead and underused, presumably as a result of the pricing, which is a shame.Charging for access is relatively normal in Europe but the pricing structure was a bit annoying as it was a blatant rip off for a place marketing itself as a “Spa”.This actually really annoyed me as I would have used the indoor pool every day had there been no (or a nominal charge).The bars and restaurants were puzzling as they didn’t seem to be very busy despite occupying some lovely spots in the resorts with some amazing views. Maybe the pricing and the menus didn’t excite people to use them?It doesn’t appear that the “Gourmet Burger” restaurant was well used. The “fancy” place with the ocean views was expensive and not for kids.We used the Atlantico café bar twice but the food was poor It was 9 euros for what appeared to look like a frozen pizza. This was shame as it also has great views across the beach.The lunch and dinner buffets in the main restaurant both looked decent but at 25 and 35 I felt they were a bit expensive compared to the external competition.We found there tended to be an exodus of families around 7pm to the adjacent restaurants which were really good and had much better food for kids.Pool bar prices were reasonably high for food and drink. Sandwiches were pretty poor. Beer expensive compared to surrounding areas.We couldn’t get a decent coffee at breakfast (i.e. instant type coffee out a machine).   Please note that despite the “cons” I would stay here again at some point but it definitely needs refurbishment in the short to medium term."
Jun 2019,50,COUPLE HOLIDAY,"Excellent hotel, facilities with supportive staff . Tips: Free bus ride from hotel to new /old town centre. Some of the tour do pick up from hotel. One beach  restaurant  down, is reasonable food but always busy. Beach bed charges apply 5 euro as of June 2019."
Jun 2019,30,Ok but no more ,Clean and tidy small rooms expensive for food and drinks and €20 to use the indoor pool was a joke nothing really bad to say but I constantly felt that the sole purpose of the hotel was to make money (which it is but the guests should not feel like this)Outdoor terrace nice and position re beach excellentBreakfast nice (hot food often cold though)Pity that outdoor terrace used for weddings not available to guests when not in useI apologise for being slightly picky but hotels get 5 stars for a reason and I felt that in this case the 5 stars were inappropriate
Jun 2019,50,Relaxing holiday,"Excellent hotel.  Courteous efficient, helpful and friendly staff.  Amazing cuisine at breakfast and dinner with a wide variety of dishes, all beautifully prepared and presented.Rooms are very comfortable.  Plenty of wardrobe and cupboard space.  Also a refreshment tray with kettle.Beautiful location.  Pretty, well looked after gardens.  Some of the steps need attention - a few broken and hazardous.  Pool area is very clean and well maintained.  Sunbeds are plentiful, although a little hard.  Pool towels are provided for guests.Overall my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely revisit.  When we had a little problem with our room not being attended to, the matter was addressed immediately.The free shuttle bus service to Albufeira is frequent and efficient.A very relaxing holiday!"
Jun 2019,50,Fantastic resort,"We recently stayed in Grande Real Santa Eulalia resort and all I can say is WOW, from the moment we arrived everything was amazing. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment, the facilities were brilliant. We had a 6 month old baby with us and the hotel provided a travel cot with a matress which was comfortable. The apartment was cleaned daily. The hotel facilities were fantastic from the pools to the bar and restaurants.we used the spa facilities and had a treatment which was very relaxing. It was also my birthday during our stay and the hotel surprised me by sending champagne and a birthday cake to my room such a thoughtful and kind gesture. There is also an italian restaurant and martins restaurant just outside the resort which are both lovely. The shuttle bus runs regularly into both old town and new town. The beach is beautiful with a lovely bar to have a quiet drink.We will definitely return and I would highly recommend the resort to everyone."
Jun 2019,50,Great stay and great views,Amazing views from breakfast. I would recommend the burger restaurant! Great  placfood.Fantastic place to stay. We loved that the hotel put on a free bus that gets you from the hotel to the old town. 5 star.
Jun 2019,40,Hotel & beach beautiful,"Breakfast lovely, over all very clean, shuttle bus very handy, Room was small, golf buggy noisy at night, if staying near reception. Kids club friendly, baby pool great, plenty shade for babys at pool, Would return, stayed for 1 week."
Jun 2019,50,Bed & Breakfast,"I can’t fault the hotel, the staff were friendly and very helpful. The breakfast was lovely. We had a resort view room which looked over the front entrance of the hotel. The pools over look the beach. It never felt crowded there was always sun beds free. You can get a clean towel everyday. The rooms were spacious. The hotel is in a great location for restaurants lots of choice in both directions out of the hotel. The strip is in walking distance and we also walked to the old town one day. Our restaurant favourites were aroma di mare, the clay oven and Thai Phuket. The gym was well equipped and air conditioned. There are 30minute fitness classes available too twice a day."
Jun 2019,50,Enjoyable,"I could spend ages writing different things about this hotel but instead I will give the most Important details. My 2 children and I had an amazing family holiday .staff great, location great , food great."
Jun 2019,50,Great Hotel ,"This is a great hotel, large complex with lovely bars and restaurants on site. The staff are very friendly and efficient. The hotel has wonderful sea views and has easy access to the beach. We ate in the seafood and burger restaurant and the food was well presented and was delicious. The cocktails were lovely and well priced at 8 euros. We were on a bed and breakfast basis and the breakfast was buffet style with a good selection of options. You good choose to eat inside or outside weather permitting. The hotel is approx 4 miles from the Old Town but the hotel offers a free shuttle bus. Although I have rated the hotel 5/5 there were some aspects that could have been improved to fully justify the 5 star rating but are very minor. The rooms although very traditional in style they are in need of updating. The drinks tray was not replenished daily and ours wasn’t full from the first day. Although you receive a complimentary bottle of water on the first day this wasn’t replaced which I would have expected. Our room was at the front overlooking the car park, I would choose a different room next time so we could sit out on the balcony and relax. But other than that the hotel was lovely and we would definitely return."
Jun 2019,50,Great hotel,Best hotel in the area in my opinion very worthy of its 5* rating only 1 criticism I would like the coffee sachets replaced every day not have to pay after first ones used when your paying upwards of £2000 for a week well ?? The water isn’t replaced either after the first bottle but not a problem as you can drink the tap water but overall fantastic hotel and location wouldn’t stay anywhere else
Jun 2019,50,Family Holiday,"The hotel was brilliant for families. The staff were welcoming and kind. The food, pools and room were perfect and the beach was clean and safe for young children. I can't recommend the hotel enough and the location was great."
Jun 2019,40,Big complex - ok place,"A bit outside the senter of Albufeira . Free buss to the center.We had a studio. Well equippet. The room was  Clean  and ok, but has not a 5 star standard.The staff was friendly and serviceminded. The first studio we got was dark and no sun on the terrass. Request for to change was met without question.It is s big complex, but have 3 different pool areals. So no problems with sunbeds.The beach is great with posibilities to walk along the shore and find a privat small beach.The restaurant offers s buffet. Thats one of the best we had. The only entertainment was live music in the bar.For us a nice stay without the woow factor."
Jun 2019,40,Good Hotel. Great Food. A little expensive,"I chose this hotel as it was located close to the beach. It was a 3 minute walk down a very accessible path. The reviews mentioned that the food was a high standard and they were correct. There was a reasonable variety in the buffet every night with thoughtful use of leftovers. I would have been happy to have each component of the buffet as a stand-alone meal. The Seaview room I was in was spacious. The bed was a bit firm but not uncomfortable. Wifi was strong throughout the hotel and even at the pool. My two negative comments are regarding the pool and the prices. The pool was just too cold. I went in June and it was 25C out but no one was in the pool as it was freezing. It seems a bit of a waste as it could be heated slightly to a comfortable temperature. The other things was the price of the drinks. If you ae on half board, you get a meal voucher to use in the main restaurant only. Soft drinks are not included. A simple soda was $3.50 and they refused to give me tap water even though there were jugs present at the breakfast buffet. The final comment is an observation that they did not have the policy like most hotels to only change towels that are on the floor. They changed my towels every day and also the towel heaters were set to be on as long as you were in the room. Not great for the environment. Maybe they could use that energy to heat the pool. All in all a nice hotel if a little expensive."
Jun 2019,50,Beautiful,"Stayed here for my honeymoon with new husband and our 3 year old son. We loved it. Staff were lovely and friendly. Plenty of pools to choose from. Lots of little things that were nice extras which we didn't see advertised. Little golf buggies to take you and luggage to rooms on checking in and just phoned reception to help us with our things when checking out, they came straight along with the buggy. Towels free from hotel reception for pool and beach and just give them back when finished using them for the day. Rooms cleaned daily. We wish we had booked 2 weeks instead of 1. Ate at the Atlantico bar a couple of times for lunch and it was lovely, plenty of staff so weren't waiting long to be served. Free shuttle bus from hotel to new and old town and returns too. Have already been looking at booking again we loved it so much and we only got back yesterday."
Jun 2019,50,Another fantastic stay,"6th time staying at this wonderful hotel. Can wait to make it a 7th. Everything is fantastic about this place, from the staff, to the scenery. My family and I can’t wait for our 2020 visit. If not sooner."
Jun 2019,50,Fantastic!,Great resort! Beautiful beach and pool. The room had a great view of the ocean. Room was clean and roomy. The resort has great restaurants and bars. I also went for a massage which was great! Perfect vacation resort.
Jun 2019,50,Beautiful Hotel in a stunning location,"We have just returned from a weeks stay in an apartment at this hotel. It was very well equipped, had cleaning service every day and was spacious. I have just read a review stating the baths were slippery, we just asked for a bath mat which was delivered very quickly. The staff were very friendly and could not do enough to help you. There are several pools and a beautiful beach. The grounds are immaculate. Everything is nearby, supermarkets and restaurants. We attended a beautiful wedding at the hotel which was perfect. The food and service were amazing. Such a stunning location. I would recommend this to anyone and will definitely be returning."
Jun 2019,50,Family trip,"Excellent staffClean, well appointed roomsGreat food and drink varietyExcellent resort, close to beach, has all manner of facilities, a little too far to walk anywhere else though. Although there is a shuttle."
Jun 2019,50,lovely hotel,"a lovely hotel, we had a classic room with a sea view. the staff were excellent. very clean. 2 things that were not ok , were no proper entertainment and the price of food and drink was too expensive."
Jun 2019,50,Relaxing,Beautiful relaxing holiday. Peaceful and quiet by the swimming pool near the appartments.  Excellent location next to a beautiful beach..free bus to old town and new town. Staff were very helpful. Highly recommend a stay here
Jun 2019,40,Came for my marriage anniversary,"People very kind, welcoming. They organised a surprise for us in the room. The hotel was very clean. The only let down was vegetarian food, the choice was terrible. Please get some veg options.....we really struggled, the ones you had very bad...other than veg food, you guys were very good. Bit pricy, i thought.."
Jun 2019,50,Apartments,"I wasn't impressed with the standard of the first apartments that I was given  it smelt damp, the plaster on the wall was coming off and the walls felt damp, there was dirty stains on the kitchen table there were ants crawling all over the kitchen work tops and the floor I was very disappointed as I was there for 7 days for a wedding  ,so I went to see the G M  who was very nice and he moved me to another apartment which was a lot cleaner and felt fresher I asked for another matress as  the one on the bed was that thin you could feel the spring and the metal bed frame which hurt my back but it was ok with the double matress I think I will stay in the hotel next time but hotel was absolutely gorgeous."
Jun 2019,50,Fantastic,"Although on the more expensive side of accommodation in Albufeira, it’s was definitely worth every penny . Really family friendly, staff are so lovely . The boys who help you with your luggage on the golf carts are brilliant . The household staff are fantastic, every day clean towels and clean your apartment. So many different pools to go too ,only a short walk to the beach . We didn’t use the kids club but piped in and out with our little ones . And they too were so nice .  Would definitely recommend this hotel ."
Jun 2019,50,"Great break,  superb hotel",We really enjoyed our week. The staff are brilliant and can't do enough to make sure you enjoy your stay. The location is beautiful and the amenities are excellent. Really enjoyed the variety o.f the food
Jun 2019,50,We had a brilliant time here. There were around 50 of us all together and everyone had the most amazing time.,"Beds are massive, we had a sea view suite which was plenty big enough for 4 of us. Breakfast was really good with plenty of  choice. The kids were in the pools all day. There was a small baby pool a medium pool which was perfect for mine and then a deep pool for adults. The pools were always spotless. Staff were brilliant. The beach is so easy to get to and again really clean.We had a great stay and would recommend"
Jun 2019,50,fabulous place to stay to truly relax,"fabulous location, staff so friendly and facilities excellent.  From the start of our trip to the end, all of our needs were taken care of .  Delighted to have access to pools and beach.  For a treat, this is the place to stay."
Jun 2019,30,The beach,"The location along the ocean was great. The employees were nice. The breakfast was varied and plentiful. The rooms were large but outdated. The hallway had a strong musty smell that never went away. The pool areas were nice, however the trashcans were overflowing and the deck was sticky"
Jun 2019,50,Excellent,Just returned from this great hotel as a party of over 50 for a wedding at another hotel. The rooms were big clean  and nicely decorated breakfast was everything you could want just one thing no water filter  in resturant  3 euros for a bottle of water  to much we took a jug of water from the cereal table baring in mind 9 of us were sat at table told we could not have it on table  drinks were reasonable for a lovely hotel  amazing views from main pool beach 5minutes away nice beach bar through gates to beach  overall we all had a lovely time even though were a lot of us all at once
Jun 2019,50,Great family holiday,"We just spent a week in the Grande Real and it was fabulous.  Our 1 bed apartment was spotless and really comfortable.  Our 5 year old loved the pools and the beach.  The staff were very friendly and welcoming.  The variety of food at breakfast was brilliant, something to suit everyone.  The resort restaurants were very expensive, no way you could eat there for the duration of the holiday.  The free shuttle bus into New Town/Old Town every day was great.  Our son didn't use the Kids Club as such but did play in the play area which was well staffed with very welcoming and fun young staff.  Zoomarine is definately worth a visit, the hotel organised a taxi for us there and back.  Will definately look at returning to Grande Real in the near future."
Jun 2019,30,Okay.,"Broke a rib slipping in the bath/shower first day. No non-slip mats, 'non-slip' appearance just painted on bath floor. Hotel management not helpful but eventually agreed to pay medical costs. Hotel restaurants expensive. The hotel is okay - a reasonable average - but nothing to write home about. Booked the hotel because of the rave Trip Advisor reviews. Not the first time the reality contradicts the reviews. First and last visit to Albufeira - all English breakfast cafes, Irish bars and all the charm of Clacton in the 60s."
Jun 2019,50,Outstanding ,Myself and my fiancé have been here almost 11 nights (last day tomorrow) I can’t rate this hotel enough. They staff are fantastic. Special thanks to the maids for cleaning our apartment every day. I just love the quirkinesses of the apartments. We were seconds away from the pool which was a big plus. The beach is beautiful right on the hotels door step. Will definitely be back. Only thing I will say to the quests is if you buy a float or ball for the pool make sure you take them away with you at night and someone will take them. Happened to a few of ours.
Jun 2019,40,Beware of Spa Theif,"Overall we had a good experience, the staff were friendly and helpful and catered for our dietary requirements.Unfortunately when we visited the spa (swimming pool sauna and steam room) there was a €20 charge and you have to buy a swimming hat for €3. After using the sauna my daughter and I we showered but my daughter's necklace was stolen from my bathrobe pocket. There was one man in spa pool, who was very tactical on reflection and had been watching our every move. When I reported the theft I was told that it could not be that man because he was a member and last year he had handed in a necklace. Unfortunately this was no comfort because I am 100% certain the necklace was carefully and purposefully placed in the bathrobe pocket as I saw this with my own eyes. So be mindful to lock away all valuables before using the sauna.The room was clean,but my swimming costume was taken with the towels when the room was cleaned (though it was alone on a separate hook), still reception staff helpfully ensured it was quickly returned to me. The beach is great too, and despite the above we generally enjoyed most of our stay."
Jun 2019,40,Beware - Light fingered SPA member,"The hotel was great, and the staff were very helpful. Unfortunately you have to pay €20 to use the indoor swimming and sauna / steam room and you must buy a swimming hat which costs €3 if you don't have one. Whilst we were in the pool a man stole my daughters necklace from my bathrobe pocket, (it wasn't lost because it was perfectly placed in my bathrobe pocket). On reflection the man had been watching us for some time and was very tactical. When I reported it staff said it could not be him because he's a member and handed in a necklace last year! So beware to lock away all valuables before using the sauna.Other than this and my swimming costume being taken with the towels by the maid's, the rest of our experience was lovely.The beach is great and the room was lovely and clean. Reception staff are very helpful and friendly."
Jun 2019,10,Unpleasant experience,"The most unfriendly, unaccomodating hotel that we have ever stayed at:  We have travelled all over the world and we can’t understand how it has a five star rating: the rooms are old and badly in need of renovation.  There is a coffee pot to make a cup of coffee but after the first day no more coffee or water is left when they clean the room. Not even toilet tissue is replaced daily. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone,  !"
Jun 2019,30,Suitable for Families but Not young travelers,"Well we have mixed feelings for this hotel. It is very convenient for families with Kids as they do have nice pool area and kids club and private beach which makes it more convenient for families. However, it was too noisy for us at night when kids were playing at the lobby during the night. The rooms were okay. they were spacious but the mattresses were stiff and not comfortable at all. We booked for garden view and it is actually the parking lot view. When we complained about the beds, they receptionist was kind enough to upgrade us to a bigger room with nice terrace and REAL garden view which they actually call a Seaview but you can barely have seaview from the trees. The breakfast has good variety but it misses the vegetables. There were only tomatoes!However, the staff were super friendly and helpful. Many thanks and huge admiration to Mr. Cruz who managed to help us book for one of the best boat tours along the caves in the region. He made sure to do his best to fullfil our requirement without any reminders. He was really of great help. I am glad i met such a person who seemed so passionate about his job and willing to help people effortlessly.Another good thing is that the hotel has free shuttles to old and new towns which made it easier for us to tour around."
Jun 2019,50,Lovely family holiday - we will return!,"We’ve just got back from a week holiday with our 2 and 4 year old children and had a fantastic time! The hotel catered for all of our needs with a young family - children friendly pools, a beach connected to the resort, fantastic children’s club and great food. We will be returning next year!!"
Jun 2019,50,Absolutely amazing,"This place is amazing. From the room views to the staff friendliness and clean rooms. The breakfast is very good, lots of choices and good food.Everyone at the kids club were absolutely amazing. Always friendly and happy to play with the kids. My daughter loved it.It was our daughter birthday and we were surprised with a cake and a nice card so much appreciated. We will defo come back"
Jun 2019,30,wedding guest,came for our grandsons wedding with my family we booked last year and we were put all over the hotel the  views from our windows were awful rooms were very dull lighting was terrible no high sockets had to boil the kettle on the floor the staff were very miserable had to buy your milk if you wanted to have a drink in the room every single hotel i have stayed in all over the world 3 to 5 stars you got 2 of tea coffee sugar spoon milk and  cream skimpping on everything even to not putting a bag in your bin ridiculous none of my family would never go there again the was cold you have one toaster at breakfast you have to wait 5 minutes and more for them to bring more bread the chess and ham omelettes were awful you could not taste the cheese about 5 little bits of ham it was discusting really all the food is garlic herbs no english food as such and I suffer with my stomach all your foods I could not eat at dinner the only one nice guy the manager had me some  plain chicken and chips made  3 nights running he was very pleasent.
Jun 2019,40,Lovely stay,"Just back from a lovely short break.  This is a really nice hotel offering beautiful views in a calm relaxing environment.  Ideal for couples.  The rooms are a great size, yes the carpet needs updating and it needs a refresh in parts but the overall look and feel of the hotel is superb, staff are lovely too. A very enjoyable stay."
Jun 2019,50,Perfect,"Perfect stay, everything about the hotel was amazing. Friendly staff. Always attentive. The proximity to the beach is amazing and location in general is good. Loved the restaurant/cafe on the way to the beach."
Jun 2019,50,Fantastic location,"The hotel staff are fantastic. The cleanliness of the hotel and apartments is exemplary. It is a bit dated for a 5 star but a very enjoyable experience. I would recommend that the kids club be relocated as it is a bit out of the way, but all in all a fantastic time had by all the family"
Jun 2019,40,Lovely stay,The beach being steps away was the highlight of our stay along with the hospitality of the hotel reception team. The rooms and hotel are nicely decorated. Breakfast was sufficient and quality was good although a wider variety would have helped.Sleep was ok but mattresses were too stiff for us and at the point of mentioning discomfort the hotel staff quickly moved us to a nicer room. The mattresses are just chosen that way.Shuttle services were perfect to be staying out of the hustle and bustle yet minutes away for free when you wanted to go.The hotel is popular with families as they host numerous stuff for kids but it’s also a nice place to stay if you want to disconnect and relax by the beach. Only surprise sun-beds belonged to a rental and not the hotel but you could still use your towel to enjoy the beach.Overall a lovely stay that was perfected due to a dedicated and friendly staff which sometimes beats it all. Big shout out to J. Cruiz for his amazing recommendations and help booking our activities.Thank you!
Jun 2019,50,Great stay again!,"Just back from another great stay in grse.  Could do with apartments upgrade & poolside not as clean as it used to be at apartments side. Hotel area definitely 5star,  however apartments don't meet 5 star quality in my book!"
Jun 2019,10,MORE 18 30'S THAN 5 STAR RELAXING HOTEL,"It turns out this hotel is used by The Priory! Yes, that Priory! The Priory is an “upmarket clinic” where people who struggle with addiction are helped. (according to the internet previous guests include Kate Moss, Pete Doherty, Robbie Williams etc etc).Consequently over 100 ""guests"" arrived and took over the place, quite literally. Openly discussing The Priory, their liver transplants and how long they had been dry or off drugs! (Although dry and off drugs was certainly not evident; people clearly intoxicated all day and a strong smell of Marijuana around the pool areas) Openly advertising their ""meetings"" (held on the hotel premises) with flyers around areas of the hotel! Blasting music around the pool, screaming abusive language and ignoring any request from Hotel security to tone it down.When we complained to the manager he took no responsibility for the bookings at his ""family hotel"" and went on to tell us there was nothing he could do as they were paying guests. Despite our (and several other complaints we were aware of) nothing was done. We were informed by a regular visitor to this hotel who had also complained, that there is an ""affinity"" between the owner of Real group of hotels and The Priory hence the presence of these people!There was no respite for the children as the only children's pool was closed for repairs throughout our 10 night stay, therefore unless you are happy to expose your children to these behaviors you have no choice but to leave the area. This is clearly collusion between the Hotel and the operators including Jet 2 with whom we booked. The reps at this Hotel are obliged to report any issues to the company they represent and pass this on to their customers which include any disruption. No wonder they keep this disruption a secret.Whilst we understand that everyone deserves a holiday this is totally inconsiderate to people like ourselves and others who have paid a good deal of money for a relaxing time.  Needless to say, we will not be returning!"
Jun 2019,30,"Child friendly, not solo traveller friendly","If you want a large resort that is child friendly then this is it. There is a dedicated kids area and many shallow pools. There is a quieter pool for adults near the main entrance tho. GRSE is 2 km from the ‘strip’ and further from historic Albufeira although they have a free shuttle. Drinks here are more than double the cost  elsewhere and the evening buffet is €32 each. The other restaurants on site are no better and of you are solo, you need to chase the staff for drinks or your bill. Breakfast however is fresh and replaced quickly for a resort of this size. Did I say it is for families?"
Jun 2019,40,Good 5 Star hotel without internet access in the room,"Good hotel, very friendly staff, several restaurants. A missed chanceou cannot charge to the room in one of the restaurants. WiFi is good in pblic places, but most of the time no internet connection or if so, no or poor access in the room. Had to complain 2 times before taking action by maintenance. Reset should fix the problem, but regrettably not."
Jun 2019,50,location location location,"Excellent hotel in a prime location. Staff both helpful and friendly. Book a sea view if possible, comes with a balcony big enough to party on! Breakfast very good, evening meal posh food a bit expensive but it is a 5 star restraint."
Jun 2019,50,Sergio and Denise,We stayed this time for leisure but got married here in August 2016. It still remains an amazing place to be looking over St Eulalia beach. The staff are very kind and helpful. Another wedding took place during our stay and it was lovely to watch from the poolside. Angela who organises the weddings is an amazing contribution to the hotel.
Jun 2019,50,Fabulous place,Great hotel next to beach.Great food and service. Very friendly staff superbly run hotel.restaurants on the beach serving great seafood and other variety would highly recommend. Free shuttle bus service into albufuria. Will revisit
Jun 2019,40,Beautifull view,"Beautiful locallocation! Big and spacey lobby and poolside as well as a quick walk to the beach! The rooms was a little disappointing but they were clean and not to smal. The hotels has two great restaurants right outside with nice prices. The hotel has a burger restaurant that’s ok, I’m not too into burgers but they were ok and the view is amazing! It’s very family friendly and even though the hotel is big, the employees recognize you and are really nice!"
Jun 2019,30,Not what it was,"Large groups of wedding guests taking over pool area. They were not residents of hotel but just came in each day to use facilities.  I understand weddings are an important revenue stream, but my husband could not use stairs while photgrapher was taking wedding photos.  We are residents too. We paid to stay but were made to feel like we shouldnt be there.  LParts of hotel shabby while on previous visits it has always been well maintained. Missing tiles in pool etc just small details but very noticeable."
Jun 2019,40,Lovely family holiday,Fantastic location Large family apartments A few English tv channels goodShuttle bus to town 10 mins AwayPools at apartments lovely Bar very expensive hardly drank there Beautiful beach on your doorstep 5 mins stroll from hotel
Jun 2019,30,Way to expensive for what it offers,"This 5stars hotel is really a 3 and half star hotel.Too expensive , apartments old fashion, food in the pool is mediocre... The reception is ok , staff are friendly ...The beach nearby is regular (you can find much better nearby).Well, it’s a 3 out of 5 rating"
Jun 2019,50,Excellent break,My wife and I have just come back from a seven day vacation and have had a lovely relaxing break. Lovely Hotel and really lovely staff. They were always friendly approachable and nothing was too much trouble. The food in all areas was lovely and plenty to chose from. It could be the time of year but entertainment was not brilliant. Will definitely be back
May 2019,50,Our babymoon,"Perfect little place for our long weekend, for a our baby moon. So chilled and lovely. Excellent service and lovely staff. We did have 2 single beds pushed together - which we weren’t happy about, but nothing to complain about. We had a room with a sea view, the balcony was huge and the view was fab. The hotel Didn’t disappoint at all. We will be back."
May 2019,50,Lovely hotel,"We came for a week at the end of May-19 - 5 adults & 4 children. We had two self catering apartments - a 1 room & a 2 room. Reception staff were brilliant. Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived (middayish). So, they changed us to an apartment that was ready & was next to the others in our party 😊. Located east of Albufeira with a short walk down to a lovely beach. Albufeira Old Town 4.5k away & walkable but along the road (not a seaside prom!). Did it a few times with a pushchair 😅. Modern & well appointed hotel (except for outside our apartment where woodwork needed attention; woodwork had been removed from most other apartments). Loads of space & clothes storage capacity 😊. Adequate self catering facilities (no oven).  Kept very clean with daily housekeeping 🙌. Fairly well kept grounds; not too good for pushchairs/wheelchairs; some slopes to the beach, but can’t avoid steps. Pool bar closes at 6pm, but no probs getting a drink just after 😊. Hotel uses a specific taxi firm that was excellent with good vehicles & children’s seats etc. Special mention for excellent Magy  who also advised on restaurants etc 🙌. We booked our return airport transfer with her (cheaper than taxi from airport). Several swimming pool areas. None suitable for proper swimming, but good for kids. Two pools in main area are heated (a bit). Good gym with ample equipment; open until 8pm. If you are self catering there is a large Intermarche Supermarket west about 2k. Taxi firm (Magy) waited for us & only charged €10 return 😊. Two smaller supermarkets east 1 & 1.5k (further one better for fresh food). We had a lovely evening buffet at the hotel’s main restaurant. Very good range, quality & service 😊.  Portobello restaurant opposite the hotel is OK & very reasonably priced, especially if you have children. Quick, but not rushed service. They also do good takeaways pizzas. We would return."
May 2019,30,Nice Hotel 2nd Stay,2nd time we stayed.  Noticed a difference this year.  The first room we were given had paint coming of the walls.  This was dealt with very quickly but not one person actually apologised for inconvenience of moving.  We have stayed at many 5 star accommodation and didnt expect to see this. The apartments were not booked out so couldnt understand why we were put in a room which obviously needed work on.  The beds are extremely uncomfortable.  When we left I didnt get asked were we happy with our stay.  Shame as we had raved about the hotel to our boys which we brought with us this time. Definitely noticed a difference from last September's stay.
May 2019,50,Just outstanding,"Outstanding beach resort with great Menities for couples and families , a variety of hotel rooms and villasGrounds are spectacular and great location near the beach and walking distance to center of town"
May 2019,50,Great location and friendly service,"You couldn't pick a better spot, right on the beach and with 3 different pool areas available as well. The service was always friendly and helpful. My garden-facing room was a bit lacking in views but nonetheless quite comfortable."
May 2019,40,The best 3 nights,"Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights for his birthday. Upon arrival the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location, we prefer the party scene so we went out to the new town every night. We got a taxi that only cost us 5 Euro’s. The pools were of good size and there was plenty of sun beds available. The breakfast was great too. The only downside I would say is that the rooms are extremely dated, and they don’t seem to have been updated since the 80’s! This didn’t affect our stay though as we didn’t spend much time in the room. Overall I would 100% recommend and will hopefully be back very soon."
May 2019,50,"Kind staff, beautiful property","I was here for a business event, so did not handle many of the logistics myself. Nonetheless, I had a lovely stay at this beautiful location. All of the staff were very kind and helpful. The conference rooms were great as well."
May 2019,50,Excellent resort.,"My wife and I stayed in a self catering apartment at this resort for 8 days. Couldn't praise it enough, lovely clean apartment, beautiful pools and beach, plenty of sun loungers, excellent hotel facilities, very helpful  and friendly staff, the list goes on. This resort is ideally located a short walk from many good restaurants and bars yet far enough away not to have a noise problem and we didn't see one hen or stag. We will definitely be back."
May 2019,40,Terrific sea view,The hotel location and service were very good. We had an excellent time. I have three recommendations for improvement; the rooms have all the amenities needed but are tired and in need of updating. Despite staying in the hotel we had to book a treatment to use the spa pool. Treatments were overpriced and I felt this was a little mean given that the swimming pools outside were more like plunge pools. It would also be great to have a shower that can be used when leaving the beach.
May 2019,50,Amazing hotel at great value.,"This is a perfectly located hotel for those who want to visit Albufeira but also enjoy a fantastic beach, pool and relaxation experience. The restaurants are expensive, but the food quality is fantastic. The free shuttle bus provided means that one can easily access more affordable restaurants in Albufeira. The breakfast buffet is one of the best I have encountered, with a huge range of foods to suit all diets and tastes. We would 100% stay in this hotel again, as there is so much to do here we didn’t even get the chance to make full use of everything provided (from free language classes, to tennis courts, to an amazing spa)."
May 2019,50,Love this place!,"We have stayed here on several occasions and each time has been wonderful! The only issue is the sofa bed, it’s not very comfortable to sleep on, but I’ll suffer it to save paying £500 extra for a 2 bed apartment!"
May 2019,40,Very good.,The location is amazing. Fabulous breakfasts the drinks are very high. The exterior is starting to look a bit shabby. Needs a paint update. Fantastic weather and we have been 4/5 times so must be good.
May 2019,50,Annual trip,Everything was good.  Only problem was last day we had power cut which stopped some tv programs and wifi for a day.  External problem not hotel.  While there a friend in UK contacted me about possible location for a wedding next August. They need accommodation for 90 people and I recommended this hotel to look at.
May 2019,50,Ticks all the boxes,"This place had everything. Amazing location, fantastic beach, lots to do and staff that couldn’t do enough to help. The spa facilities were great and so was the gym. I only ate occasionally as there are so many restaurants nearby you are spoilt for choice."
May 2019,50,Awesome Resort,"Thoroughly enjoyed a week in this resort. We stayed in a suite - well equipped, spotlessly clean, comfy bed, adjustable air con, tea and coffee facilities, luxurious soft towels and an iron sent to room within ten minutes of it being requested. Bathrooms were spacious, clean and modern.We stayed half board and ate evening meals rather than lunches. Breakfasts and dinners were simply fabulous. A wide choice of delicious food and attentive, polite staff.The pool area is super with a great choice of pools and areas to lie in the sun or shade. The sun beds are all comfortable and firm.The beach is a short walk from the pool area and is perfect for a stroll and a dip.There is a good choice of where to have lunch and, once again, all meals were lovely.The free shuttle bus is clean and modern and reliable.In conclusion we would all highly recommend the resort and would definitely return in the future."
May 2019,50,Excelent stay,"It was a pleasure to be there. Service was excellent, room was quite big, bed was huge and very comfortable, bathroom nice and clean. View to the pool and Ocean was really nice. Great breakfast with variety of products, but I would appreciate more kind of fresh vegs, not only tomatoes.We loved the pool which have a nice view to the ocean. It's great there is an entrance to the beautiful beach which is few steps from the hotel.There is live music few times a week at the evenings - which I adored - it's very nice and relaxing after whole of activities.What I found a bit funny is a set of tea/coffie bags in a room which are paid. Does hotel really need to charge 1.5E from customer who already paid 120E/night for every bag of tea?"
May 2019,50,Love this place!,"Happy customer this & last year! Service and quality high, affordable prices, great location, beautiful views. Beach & pools to choose from. Close to town but equally private if you wish to be so. Thank you."
May 2019,40,Love this hotel,Hotel is gorgeous. I do think they should provide milk with tea and coffee in the rooms. Lighting for make up for women is an issue in the rooms also. Beach restaurant is great but only when the one guy is there running it. Last 2 days sat and Sunday he wasn’t there and service was really poor. Bills were wrong and had to queue just to pay the bill as waitresses were not on the ball
May 2019,50,Wonderful wonderful Grande Real Santa Eulalia,"I couldn't believe we got such a great place to stay for such value.   It was a dream break. A dream location.    The staff were all  so kind and helpful.  The food, the amazing wifi even down on the beach. We are planning our return again next year.  It was my first time in Portugal."
May 2019,50,4 night break,Absolutely georgous hotel service was brilliant and not over priced nothing was to much bother will defenatly be coming back and I will defenatly recommend ❤ everything I could have wanted in a holiday and more thankyou for making my 25th anniversary extra special xx
May 2019,10,"Not the same hotel like in picture, no every day water of bottle, in all places smells like in old houses,food expensive","First if all its not same hotel like in picture, food expensive and no choise to have light breakfast only all included in 19€ and you can eat how you want... no fresh water every day in hotel room and its 5 stars hotel. Hotel looks like before bankrot. I changed 3 rooms and smell in two of this was like old house, terible expierence."
May 2019,50,60th birthday holiday,Excellent holiday with excellent service all round!Provided bottle bubbly and good size cake with glasses plates etc in room when we returned back from day out! Lovely surprise!Only recommendation is when booking suite with sea view go for the higher floors as we could not see much in room 137!
May 2019,40,Under wandering star,"ad a very nice stay, too short to see and experience everything. In room would add sockets or extension cord, when one travels with tablet, phone etc which need to be charged, would be nice to have socket next to bed. I am not a morning person while on holiday so breakfast in a big restaurant was a disappointment, too many people too much noise. Food was very good, but could not handle the noise, so had my coffee in bar."
May 2019,40,Lovely place,"I’m writing this on our last night in the resort, l can honestly say could not find fault with anything from the accommodation to the staff. 4 of us & 1 child had a 2 bed 2 bath apartment (520) very spacious & spotlessly clean we used the Atlantic Resteraunt in the daytime a couple of times,  reasonably priced, also used rm’s up the road a couple of times, excellent food & service also tried portobellos across the road for pizza this was also good. Loads of food choices in town, the old town that is. Warning! Avoid the new town strip, makes magaluf look classy!"
May 2019,40,Not bad...,"The Hotel and Resort ist interesting and quite good, but it's the small things that would have made my stay even more pleasurable: a make-up mirror in the bathroom (especially because both the bathroom mirror and the room mirror are very distant from the user because ""hidden"" by a deep washstand and a deep table), a well-working air conditioning right from the start, better lighting in the room (there are two lamps by the nightstand, one tiny and very weak one on the opposite wall and a floor lamp whose switch is hidden behind a heavy armchair and therefor cannot be used... And I could keep going with those ""little"" things..."
May 2019,50,Fantastic hotel beautiful location,"We spent 5 nights at this hotel bed and breakfast and had the most amazing holiday! The hotel really is lovely with such friendly helpful staff, location is perfect just 5 minutes away from the main strip which the hotel runs a free shuttle bus to old town and new town. The views from this hotel and just stunning! I really couldn’t recommend this resort enough and we already can’t wait to come back again next year."
May 2019,40,Relaxing break,"Really nice and friendly hotel. Only faults I found were no showers at the gym, and noise from next appartment in the self catering is annoying, if you have late nighters as neighbours! Otherwise, fabulous place."
May 2019,30,Could be much better for five stars,"Nice hotel, good location, friendly staff, but a lot of maintenance should be done, specially in the rooms: aircondition was not cooling, towel rail was ragged, make-up mirror was missing ... The beach towels were really small and in bad quality,"
May 2019,50,Great Hotel and Wonderful Staff,"Stayed for wedding, beautiful venue, staff were so friendly and helpful.  Really enjoyed.  Lots of swimming pools and right beside a lovely beach.  Great Breakfast.  Several restaurants in hotel and also lots within walking distance as is the new town"
May 2019,30,Family holiday,"This hotel is not 5 star. Rooms were okay, cleaning was average, sometimes no towels replaced or toilet roll, had to ask at reception. Buffet dinner was not great. Breakfast was average, no gluten free or dairy free options. No smoothies which I would expect from a decent hotel. Also large queues for breakfast, not enough tables to accommodate number of guests. Entertainment was below average. But my biggest complaint is that I chose this hotel as it had an indoor pool and sauna, however we were then told it was an extra €20 per person per hour to use it. This is disgraceful! The location of hotel is good and we had a lovely view but we will not return."
May 2019,50,Definitely recommend,"Staff are super friendly, the food is gorgeous with very little wait time. The breakfast had a huge selection & would definitely recommend people to get breakfast included, it’s definitely worth it. Great location, 2 min walk to beach which has a water sports facility. Will definitely be back again!"
May 2019,50,Fabulous hotel and location,"Hotel fully deserved its 5* rating. Service was excellent with all staff very helpful. Quality and choice of food and beverages was excellent, if a little pricier than in town. Room was a good size, with a good balcony,  was clean and had everything needed. Toiletries and towels refreshed daily. Towels for pool/beach provided. The location was very good, close enough to walk into Santa Eulalia and Albufeira if wanting a livelier atmosphere, but far enough out to have a quiet, relaxing environment. Hotel also provided free shuttle service throughout the day. A very enjoyable experience all round."
May 2019,50,Lovely place to stay,Just returned from a 10 day trip and had a great time. The location is stunning (it is in a bay on the beach and has virtually the whole use of the bay). The facilities offered by the hotel are excellent. Breakfast is a food explosion with a wide range of options presented buffet style. The pools were never overly busy and the beach big enough to unsure you aren't sitting on top of one another.The only slightly negative things I could say were that despite having a lot of swimming pools none of them are really big enough for someone who likes to swim rather than dip and if I went again (which I am fairly sure I will be) I would opt for a sea view room rather than a resort view (we were on the ground floor facing onto the car park/main entrance). Oh and I think the signage marking the entrance to the hotel could be a bit more prominent for first time visitors (we arrived in the dark and missed it first time round). Only minute niggles. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
May 2019,40,Great Hotel in a Great Setting,Very nice hotel with easy access to the beach. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which was really spacious. Very good facilities for smaller kids. Only criticism I would have is that the food could have been better. Other than that though it was a great stay and I would definitely return.
May 2019,50,Good and peaceful hotel,"Nice hotel with pools, tennis courts and beach close by. Hotel room A/C was quite noisy but that was only minus side. Service was kind and a lot of gluten free option on breakfast buffet. Waiter knew for sure what means gluten free diet for celiac people :)City is pretty close, less than 2km and taxi was only 5€ though walking was also ok."
May 2019,50,Great Hotel - fantastic value!,"Spent four nights at the Grand Real Santa Eulalia and it exceeded expectations. The ambience was great, staff very pleasant and helpful and was very clean. The a la carte lunch on our last day was absolutely amazing! I enjoyed everything about my stay. Would definitely book again!"
May 2019,40,very nice stay,My wife and I have just stayed 2 nights at the Grande Santa Eulalia and overall It was a very nice stay we stayed in the self catering apartments which were nice with good facilities I do not know the difference in the price but the hotel itself seemed a much nicer place to stay as I would say the mail hotel is fine to be classed 5 star but the apartments are not we did no eat at the hotel as we found it expensive it has a very nice private beach but it does lead into the public beach and does not include any sunbeds etc free with the hotel it has nice swimming pools that do offer sunbedsThe staff on reception was very nice and they had a shuttle into the main town which was very good. I would have said this hotel was better than I have said apart from the cleaning our room and the wardrobes had a terrible musty smell the cleaners knock on our room to clean it at 09.30am which when on holiday is very earlier we said we were not ready but they did not come back which was not a problem but not 5 star service if the hotel worked harder on the cleaning side I would say this hotel was fairly rated at 5 star but for our stay not so
May 2019,50,Beautiful Resort with very nice staff,"Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and Spa is a beautiful facility.  The rooms and bathroom are very spacious.  There is plenty of drawers and closets to store your clothes.  We booked an ocean view which had a stunning view of the grounds and the beach.  The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful as were the restaurant staff.  I want to give a special shout out to Lidia at the pool bar, who is very friendly and makes the best caipirinhas.  I would love to come here for another holiday!  Thank you for making our first holiday in Algarve very special!"
May 2019,50,Recomend for everybody!!!,"Lovely hotel. Excellent staff, I liked everything, great rooms, daily housekeeping. 3 warm pools, pools for children, playgrounds, a private beach. Huge parking for cars. I did not want to leave !!! Perhaps this is the most important thing !!! I recommend everyone, you will not regret. Happy to come back again and again."
May 2019,40,Good 5 starts hotel,"I stayed for 2 nights in this hotel in Albufeira, Algarve.The rooms are luxurious and very comfortable and the staff is very polite and actively willing to serve you.Breakfast was good, but for these class of hotels you would expect more diversity.The hotel has a private access to a small beach, which is very convenient."
May 2019,30,Great location not 5 stars,"Great location, excellent front desk service and the snack bar overlooking the sea was great.The hotel needs updating, it’s clean but the service levels are poor - Not 5 star for sure.Breakfast is chaotic and very limited in variety and quality  with no fresh cooking stations for eggs which is commonplace in most hotels 4* and above. No waiter/waitress service for hot drinks.p at breakfast. The maid service was terrible, glasses not cleaned and hot drink sachets not replenished unless you ask. The price we paid looked very reasonable and I suspect that’s because you do not receive 5 star service levels. Love the location but the area has changed alot in the 5 years since we last visited. It’s now a Stag and Hen weekend destination (Albuferia old town) so there’s a feel of Magaluf strip about this area now which is fine if that’s what you like."
May 2019,40,Nice hotel and apartment complex,Stayed in a one bed apartment Spotlessly cleaned and daily maid serviceDated decor but adequately equipped and spaciousBar drinks extremely expensive but luckily it’s walking distance to bars and restaurants in the new town. Convenient complimentary shuttle service to both old and new town
May 2019,40,Kids loved it,My sons would rate it 11/10 if possible. They absolutely loved it. It has a couple of nice pools and very easy access to the beach. And the scenery is really nice. I have rated it down a little bit as our apartment was somewhat worn and would need an overhaul.
May 2019,50,Wow!!,"We were here for my best friends wedding and we LOVED the place! Apartment was spotless, cute & comfortable. Service was unbelievable food was fabulous !!I'd love to come back asap !! Would defintly recxomemd to a friend"
May 2019,30,Won’t be returning,"Stayed here recently for two nights, my fiancé had emailed the hotel to say we were visiting as we were viewing the hotel as a possible wedding venue next year.Check in was fine, then we were shown to our room. The corridor absolutely stank of stale cigarettes, carpets worn & room was very basic facing trees.We had breakfast both mornings it was fine.Rang reception first morning requesting an iron & it never arrived despite two phone calls.The staff are not friendly , the pool areas are nice but we’re Definately glad we stayed here as we immediately ruled it out as a wedding venue. Much nicer hotels in the area for similar prices."
May 2019,40,great location by the beach,"this hotel is situated in a lovely location on the beach, though its rated as a five star the apartments though very comfortable and spotlessly clean are quite tired and could really do with updating.The kids club staff were amazing. My little boy is special needs and they went out of their way to make him feel included. He had a great time."
May 2019,50,Beautiful and Serene,Beautiful and well maintained hotel. Staff are very helpful polite . Food and breakfast bar was good.  Good bus services to get around town. Room are clean but may need some touching up . overall experience was great. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends
May 2019,50,great service,"in one word fantastic, it was beautifulall my guest are planning a revisit .we were welcomed and treated wellwe travel for a family function the service was excellent, the event planners, Angela and Patricia are a force to reckon with, they made sure everything was in order, they took away every stress and handled the occasion with the pose of their excellent skills, I am forever indebted. I intend to maintain a close relationship."
May 2019,50,Great stay and Friendly Staff,Had a lovely stay at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia recently for a friends wedding. The staff at the hotel were fantastic. The rooms were extremely clean with stunning views and a lovely balcony area too.
May 2019,50,Room Cleaning and Tourist Information,"As a 5* hotel, I expected complimentary tea, coffee and milk in the room everyday and not just for one day. Cups and glasses were not cleaned everyday. When I approached the chambermaid regarding the replacement of bath floor towel, her response was a stern and angry - no!  There was no local map or tourist information at reception desk.  We had to ask for a map"
May 2019,50,Beautiful views,"My stay in Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort was a short 4 night stay, beautiful hotel, ideal location with private beach.Would definitely recommend this place to any staying in Albufeira.The staff was amazing very helpful and I would give it a 5* feel.Breakfast was nice good variety of food and fresh fruit."
May 2019,50,So good - been back 2 times,"I first came to this hotel coordinating a conference with work in March and enjoyed it so much I returned just 1 month later for a personal family holiday.Like most of Portugal the staff are friendly and the standards are extremely high (relatively compared with other Southern Europe countries). The staff were during both stays very efficient and professional, and the hotel was a great experience. For my conference, the staff were as helpful as possible and never refused any task or request to try and benefit our group. This helped our event run smoothly and I would personally like to single out Pedro Portela for all his help.For my personal stay, I returned during the Easter holiday time so much higher season. Even so, the staff were still really friendly and helpful but more importantly this hotel just gave the impression it could manage successfully - even with high occupancy. For example, there was still always sunbeds available by the swimming pool, it was still possible to get a table in all the restaurants for dinner, and there were still seats available in the lounge during the evening entertainment. This is something worth mentioning, as from travel experience I've found in other countries / hotels often it can be frustrating being away at ""high season"". The hotels often feel very busy or there is never enough / free space to access fully the facilities.Finally I would recommend this hotel for families but also professionals wanting a break in the Algarve as this hotel has facilities to cater for all without being overpowering. A place I would truly recommend in the Albufeira region if I return in the future and would not hesitate to recommend to you to plan future visits. The only final point to realise is that this is a large hotel complex so it may not suit all but again as I said previously it doesn't feel overpowering."
May 2019,10,Does not deserve even 4 stars,"This resort definitely has had better times and needs in my opinion a major restructuring and an important reorganization. When we arrived we discovered that two out of four restaurants of the hotel were closed for dinner. One because they always keep it closed on Monday and the other because they had some technical problem. But if you have a technical problem in one of the restaurants you should have the flexibility of thinking to keep opened the other one, even if it is Monday. Breakfast works alright if weather is fine, because they use the terrace too. But if you have a rainy morning you will find yourself in a queue of 30/40 persons waiting to be seated. We have booked a suite but the room had nothing to do with a suite. The furniture showed evident signs of a lack in maintenance. The same may be said for the furniture in the lobby. The sofas there are so old that you might have some problem to find one that is not filthy. To use the spa we were requested to pay EUR 20/hour. Never heard something like that."
May 2019,40,Great location,We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. It is huge with 2 bathrooms a kitchen and living room. The colours are bright and cheerful making the ambiance fun. The location is pretty good. You can walk to the super market and restaurants outside the resort. Anything else you can get a taxi or take the free shuttle. Although the free shuttle only runs 6 or 7 times a day starting at 10:30 and ending at 18:30. Overall a great place to stay with a very nice beach and plenty of pools. (P.S. Some of the staff is friendly some not so much.)
May 2019,50,Short break,"Self catering break, great hotel studio room very clean, no welcome pack ! And no information pack which made it harder to find supermarkets. Very good free bus service to old town. Bar prices higher on the night recommend the short walk 15 minutes to the town."
May 2019,50,Amazing holiday,"Beautiful hotel and complex , cannot praise highly enough . Visited with my daughter and we be returning next year with my grandchildren as the kids facilities looked amazing. Free bus to strip and old town ."
May 2019,50,"Wow, better than I remembered","I came here as a last minute pre Christmas girlie trip in December 2018. The resort was beautiful, with out of the ordinary temperatures for that time of year; being in the mid 20’s. I was so impressed with everything that I rebooked on my return home for me and my husband. In fact we are here now; halfway through our weeks break. We booked a sea view room this time round and wow, I am just astounded. I could sit on the balcony all day taking in that view, but then I would miss out on the delicious breakfast complete with champagne! Not to mention the Spa and other amenities. My husband has been really impressed, such lovely staff and the picturesque Old Town, a real highlight. Will be back again later in the year. That says it all really!"
May 2019,50,Clean and fantasic venue,"We booked the one bedroom Appartment 402, fantastic spacious one bedroom Appartment, very clean and cleaning staff done a great job everyday Highly recommended and staff very friendly .... the only downside the Spa below average I will give the spa three stars max"
May 2019,40,Overall service,"My wife and I enjoyed our 5 nights stay at your Hotel, and our giving a “very good” rating reflects that.Needless to say, we have rebooked for another stay later in the year.Areas for improvement is the air conditioning in the rooms - one cannot have not too cool airflow in the summer, although the thermostat setting was placed at 26 degrees.  Plus, of course, the not too frequent shuttle bus service to town - the Manager needs to implement an hourly bus service, which will be most welcomed by guests.All in all, almost within touching distance of an excellent rating."
Apr 2019,50,"Excellent hotel, great location","We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay at this hotel. Location is wonderful, quiet and beautiful setting on a beach. The staff are extremely friendly, the rooms are big and clean. The facilities are spotless and it is short distance to main city. Would highly recommend."
Apr 2019,30,Kids club disaster,We booked this hotel solely because kids club was running at the time. In fact we only used it once for 90 minutes as the manageress was extremely rude if not aggressive because we were two minutes late the first day we left the kids there. One of them had been crying and didn’t want to go back so that was that. They always love kids clubs.
Apr 2019,40,Grand Real,"On the whole an excellent hotel. Disappointing to find a 5* hotel charging €1.50 for a refill of a tea bag or coffee sachet and 0.50 cent for sugar, if using the tea coffee provided in the rooms. Something more suited to a budget airline with add on extras .. rather than a 5* Hotel . Really lowers the tone of the Hotel. pity ."
Apr 2019,50,Birthday break,"I can't say much more than fantastic. Brilliant location. Lovely beach easily reached in 2 mins. Shuttle bus a bonus to take to old town. Rooms comfortable and cleaned daily. Breakfast good. The staff excellent always ready to help. Thanks to all the staff especially Ines, raphael, and Jorge. Execelent guys."
Apr 2019,50,Fantastic spot,"Fantastic hotel, very well maintained and excellent facilities.  Fantastic food - the buffet breakfast was quite special and the champagne was lovely. Views from hotel were stunning.  Gorgeous to have lunch overlooking the beautiful beach.Fabulous staff.  Rooms were very comfortable and spotlessly clean.  Cleaning ladies did a great job every day.  We will be back next summer - no doubt about it."
Apr 2019,40,Easter Break,"Good for families.  Friendly service, clean rooms, great facilities for young kids.  The only downside was the lack of a shop for milk / bread / water, which was a good 10-15 minute walk away. Not great when staying in self catering accommodation."
Apr 2019,40,Great location,"My husband & I stayed here for 1 week with our two teenage children. The location is fantastic, right above the beautiful beach, just a few easy slopes to get down.Old town & new town both an easy walk & the free hotel shuttle bus ran perfectly on time. Staff very efficient, professional & friendly. Jerome on reception particularly helpful.Hotel kept very clean throughout but the room could have been more thoroughly cleaned. I had to ask for my balcony & outside table to be cleaned as it was grubby. One bottle of water provided to the room on the first night only, that’s not great & no tea or coffee making facilities in room.Two pools outside, smaller one was heated but larger not.Breakfast was ok & the vegans in the family coped although the offerings could have been more varied & rich. We were uninspired to try the evening buffet here.Very disappointed to see animals being used for entertainment in the reception area, there are enough entertainment options available without having to resort to this. There was an iguana & a parrot on various evenings. Would be better to offer a children’s entertainer & quality musicians. Also disappointed to see single use plastic cups & straws in the day cafe overlooking the beach. Spa was unavailable for use by under 16’s yet we had to pay full adult room price for our teenage children. Not fair. Looked like a lovely indoor pool but only available to adults and for a fee as well.We were lucky we had great weather during our stay otherwise we would have struggled to find something to do in the hotel."
Apr 2019,40,Perfect location,"In general the place is very nice, the location perfect, the room ok, pool, food, services excellent. I think by the way, that it is more a 4 than a 5 star hotel. The only complain would be for the third bed that was extremely uncomfortable. I really cannot understand how in such a hotel, an added bed can be so minimalist, bent in the middle, with a mattress of max 8 (?) cm. We stayed 5 nights, enough for having back ache all the week.We were three and two times I had to ask for the third towel in the room."
Apr 2019,40,Amazing views and lovely pool close to beach,"The service was really disappointing – the staff were short, unhelpful and very rude, and in no rush either. We stayed off-peak so the Hotel wasn't even at capacity – based on this, I wouldn't stay again. However, the hotel itself was lovely and the views and proximity to the ocean was amazing. Great location as well."
Apr 2019,40,Could be better,"Just returned with family’s . Ok fist the good location is excellent beach is gorgeous . Apt ok clean and nice bathroom.  Service at the bar very slow and entertainment ok but nothing special.Hotel needs a  mini market like all other hotels close buy would be useful . Pool areas are all decked beware of splinters we had a few and broken decking in places.Basically the hotel needs maintenance looking very tired in places as many others have mentioned.Ok I would give the hotel 4 * not a 5 . Would I come back well that would depend on the price,"
Apr 2019,50,Fantastic family destination,"Terrific hotel with fantastic facilities and top class service throughout. Brilliant kids club, lovely beach and swimming pools. Staff very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend this hotel for family holidays!"
Apr 2019,40,"Comfortable beds, friendly staff, clean surroundings ","I’ve just come back from a very pleasant 4 night stay in this lovely hotel. The reception staff were all friendly and helpful, but especially Rüben, who was exceptional in dealing with requests and giving information about nearby excursions. I stayed in a suite, which was spacious and clean. There isn’t much to do in the area, but it’s perfect for a short break if you just want to relax by the beach, which is literally a few yards away. I would have given it a 5 star rating had it not been for the extra charge to use the spa facility, and not being able to control the room temperature; it’s either set too cold or hot, with no way of manually controlling it. The hotel is child friendly so expect to see a lot of kids running around! My nieces loved the kids club so I would recommend the hotel to anyone travelling with children."
Apr 2019,40,"Decent Hotel, value for money","We went for a few days leading up to the Easter Holidays and had a relaxing time. Our flight arrived very early in the morning and we were at the hotel about 4-5 hours before check in, but the staff were very accommodating, allowing us to check in. The apartment is spacious, adequate for a family of four. We were placed in one of the apartments towards the front of the resort, consequently close to the main road. This wasn't any issue though. There is an on site gymn and spa and 4 outdoor pools and a paddle pool. One pool is ""heated"" but tended to be crowded. There is a small supermarket within a 3 minute walk and a larger Intermarche a 15 minute walk away.  The free shuttle service to the New and old towns is a plus - though take note that when it's busy, being British queueing up comes naturally but that may work against you as other guests just turned up at the last minute and boarded. Staff are so friendly even where there is a language barrier.  Proximity to the beach is another plus for this resort. It is definitely family friendly, comfortable and we will visit again."
Apr 2019,50,Brilliant,"The whole stay was lovely. Hotel itself was really nice. Perfect location,  with a shuttle bus in and out of new/old town. (€3 to new town in a taxi) Gym and spa were nice. Outdoor pools, few minutes walk to the beach, great facilities and the staff were overall very helpful. Reasonably priced. Cocktails were great. Breakfast was brilliant. Board games available at reception. The resort in all had everything you could want. Would definitely go back."
Apr 2019,30,A very average hotel with 5 stars.,"Have been going to Albufeira / Olhos de Agua for many years and have ""eyed this place up"" quite a few times. We are huge fans of this part of the world and had high expectations of this hotel as we assumed that the 5 star rating would mean it was even better than the places (3 star and 4 star) that we had previously stayed in. Not so unfortunately. This is a Spa hotel first and foremost. It is not suitable for families with younger children (8 and 4). The ""apartment"" is very badly equipped for families. There is only a small 2 ringed hob and the sink doesn't even have a draining board. There is no shop / minimarket for basic provisions! We asked 4 times for a a clothes airer to dry our clothes (bathing suits etc) outside and this very simple request remained unfulfilled for the duration of our stay (one week). There is very little for kids to do onsite .... again this is a Spa hotel for adults or parents with independent (teenage) kids. The indoor swimming pool is for ""Spa guests only"" and incurs a supplement of €20 per adult per visit! We spent our time next door most days at a neighbouring 3 star hotel which had a huge play park in it etc. We found the 3 star hotel to be much more suitable for our needs and way more welcoming …. basically the kids loved it and we have already booked it for next summer (the 3 star hotel that is)."
Apr 2019,50,Amazing!!,We ended up here after Teletext Holidays messed up our booking for Real Marina Residence. So glad we did. Had a 1 bed apartment very spacious and clean. Quite noisy as next to the main road but was late so couldn’t be bothered to ask to be moved. Soon got used to it though. Also foisty smell coming from the cupboard in the hall area. The service and friendliness of the staff was impeccable and would definitely return. Drinks a little expensive compared to bars/restaurants outside of the hotel. Free shuttle to old and new towns which we took advantage of one day. Only ate in the Cozinha restaurant as we were half board. Breakfast and Dinner choices extensive as were house drinks. We used the pool bar once for food and drinks again very good. Also used Real Bar most nights. Live music very good. Hotel leads down to Santa Eulália beach. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel. Thank you we will return.
Apr 2019,50,Beautiful resort,"Overall a 5 for the stay - amazing seafood restaurant (special mention to the staff there who were wonderful particularly with our 5yr old) andjust wow at the beach! So peaceful. Stayed self catering 1 bed and more than adequate. Food pricey but worth it. Kids club super - again great staff and activities.... He didn't want to hang out with us much! Only point... Staff at beach cafe a bit sour and slow service as were the bar staff at times but others made up for it. Overall a wonderful stay and highly recommended. Bus to town service great too. Thank you very much for our stay - Leanne, Nick and Jamie Hendry"
Apr 2019,40,Nice relaxing hotel with Spa and beautiful beach,"I had booked an other Real Hotel in Olhão, but because of overbooking my booking has been cancelled. They offered me Grand Real Santa Eulalia instead plus Spa free of costs. This hotel is rather far away from Albufeira Town, from train station and Airport. So I was using free shuttle bus to Albufeira Old Town and taxis plus train to Tavira, Faro, Silves, taxi to Loulé, and FatCats Transfer to Sagres and to the Airport.My room with ocean view was comfortable, very calm, I could sleep well. The bath with tub, spacious. When I asked for water boiler to make tea, it was brought to my room immediately. In the Spa I was using sauna, Turkish bath and thalasso pool with heated ocean water. It was nice and relaxing. There is also a small fitness."
Apr 2019,50,The best,"Loved everything about hotel especially the staff; a gentlemen at the reception called Joao Cruz he recommended us places to go, activities and gave us honest opinions about certain excursions and trips to take. He went above and beyond, the management should definitely see him as an asset to this hotel."
Apr 2019,40,Relaxing family stay,"We have opted to stay in a self catering apartment, which was the right option for us due to our children allergies and the actual cost of meals at the hotel. The location of the hotel was great - near enough to Faro airport (30-40 min drive) but also central enough to venture towards Silvas castle and Foia mountain one day and towards Lagos, Sagres and Cape St Vincent another day. We were very pleased with the service and immaculate daily clean of the apartment. The hotel itself was very nice and the access to the beach was useful. AS the sea was still quite cold, boys used mainly the heated pool and liked running from the heated pool to the cold pool and vice versa but also playing football with friends on the lawn next to the poolside bar. Our apartment was large and comfortable. The sofa bed in the living room is not that comfy for an adult but we only needed to use it as our little one is not a good sleeper. The bedroom bed is a queen size and very comfortable. We loved our stay and there are plenty of positives. The only one thing that we were discouraged by was the cost of food there (breakfast 20 Euros per adult on ad hoc basis), which we found a bit expensive."
Apr 2019,50,Amazing Stay!,"Amazing hotel and facilities! Could not believe how amazing the hotel and facilities were, very kind staff and the breakfast was incredible! Will definitely be returning with my future children in years to come!"
Apr 2019,50,Recent Stay,"we had a lovely stay and really appreciated the very kind gesture of a bottle of champagne delivered on arrival to our room from Hotel Management. Rooms were very comfortable, location was great.The only downside was having to pay to use the in-door swimming pool."
Apr 2019,40,Value for Money!,"We stayed for 4 nights and had an awesome experience! Have multiple options to spend time. Pool,Spa, Kids club, Beach etcShuttle services are really handy! Will definitely recommend this! True worth for Money!"
Apr 2019,50,Another great stay!,"This was our second visit to the hotel. Had a wonderful 2 weeks. Our room had a sea view which was lovely waking up to each morning. The room was clean and spacious, if I had one small problem it would be the comfort of the beds. They are very hard and I would recommend replacing them or at least put decent mattress toppers on them as I came home with a bad back. The mattress on the extra bed was also very poor and where it had been folded up in the base it was all compressed together leading to a mattress of two halves! That said, I would definitely go back as the hotel itself and staff are fantastic. It was great when some of the staff remembered us from last year! Loved the new sun beds, even if it was very busy around the pool."
Apr 2019,50,Great family friendly hotel,"Our second times staying in the hotel. I can't fault it in any way. Very clean grounds, spacious apartment, very friendly staff. The kids club was the highlight for our trip. My four year old ran to it every morning. The staff running it was very friendly. Lovely restaurant by the beach with very reasonable prices. Weather not great at this time of year but that can't be helped. Will definitely be returning."
Apr 2019,40,"Location, Location, Location!","We stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks in April.  The location is perfect - 100m from the beach!  We had a great sea view and could hear the ocean at night!  It was great!  The rooms are dated and old but very spacious!  The restaurant was excellent - we had an 8 month old with us and every meal (breakfast / dinner) they made fresh fruit and veggie puree' for our baby! The only real negatives I experienced was the maid cleaning service - it was horrible!  Many times we were left without towels and after the first few nights they even stopped leaving chocolates on my bed :(  The overall maintenance of the hotel and grounds was a dismal - it was old and needed a refreshment!  So, if you are looking for good food and service and a perfect beach location - this is your place!"
Apr 2019,30,Good Property but below average service,"We booked in reading great reviews of this place and were really surprised with our experience. One reason could be that I compare it with other 4-5 star experiences in hotels outside of Europe.In my honest opinion, this is a great property, really nice loction, very wide and beautiful campus to be a 5 star. However the services and facilities here dont even match a 3 star.We were supposed to be reaching very late for check in (around 11:45 pm) and had our 2 year old son accompanying us. You would expect to be checking in asap and retire to bed at that hour. Our check in was smooth and luggage was dropped in well. However we started having lot of issues with the room.Firstly we requested  a double bed sea view room. It was provided to us at 3rd floor with nice views, but 2 twin beds were joined. We had to chase the reception atleast 3 times before the staff came almost 30 min after first call dnd covered the layers over the 2 beds to make it one double bed.Second the Fridge was not working, we were carrying some food for us and our son which we could not store. As it was late, the reception told us they can only check it the morning after.The rooms dont have tea-coffee making facility (yes my first time in any hotel 4* and above). We still requested an electric kettle to heat up some of our baby food and it was a leaking kettle.The hotel doesnt provide you plates, bowls, glasses, cups, cutlery in room for free (yes another shock for me, never experienced this ever). They charge 5 Euro service fee everytime you ask them to bring any plates etc to the room.Finally when we could retire to sleep after all this, we realised the AC was not working in the room and it got really hot.I complained again the next day at reception. They did get the AC and Fridge fixed and it started working. However we realised that the temperature control of the AC was actually not working only showing the numbers, so we either used to switch on or switch off the AC for the rest of our stay as it was getting v cold.The kettle was replaced with another one whose auto cutoff was not working so we gave us raising these issues. There was a working chair in room which was work out and sagging and was not replaced as well.The room and bathroom furnishing was also dated and average, nothing new or fancy. I think the hotel is in need for  major refurb in the rooms.However the sea view from the room and balcony is amazing I admit and since we were on the 3rd floor it made it much better.Coming on the breakfast, it was a good english and continental breakfast spread with lots of options. No regional hot food is served though. However again, tea/coffee is self serve from a machine. No fresh brewed coffee on the table for you. Staff also not very warm, english is a challenge. Mostly the staff will hover around to pick plates from your table, even unfinished ones on occasions.Also it does get very very busy and crowded during breakfast, especially one sunday or closer to the finish time and you have to queue up for everything, getting a table also is a challenge and you keep on bumping into people and fighting for your servings.The pools are nice, 3 different in the hotel area and 2 more in the apartment area. Well maintained. The access to beach is the best part, they do provide towels for the beach. They have spa facilities but you cant access indoor pool or jacuzzi, sauna for free again. The hotel tends to charge you for everything which is considered  a standard 5 star facility and service, this puts you off.Campus as I mentioned is nice. They have a shuttle for new and old town which is convenient but it ends by around 6 pm.We rented a car and then it becomes very accessible, less than 5 min to The Strip, new town and 10-15 min for Marina.Also there was good children activities in the kids club, you need to really find out these locations as they are not very prominently marked. In the evenings they have either a live music or some children show to engage.If you want to enjoy the beach access, children activities, pool and have a nice view and ready to pay for everything else, this is a good place."
Apr 2019,50,vacation,"Great place on a beautiful beach. Staff are very courteous and most helpful.Our stay did not include any meals, but there are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. (5 to 10min). Most of these places have very reasonable prices and the service was excellent."
Apr 2019,50,Lovely Holiday,Great place for kids. The place and facilities are very goos. We stayed in the apartments and the layout of them was great. The rooms we very clean and the cleaning staff cleaned every day for us . Thank you
Apr 2019,30,Lunch by the sea,"Called into the restaurant by the sea for coffee and cake but stayed for beer and pizza. Fast efficient service but not warm and friendly, clean place with lovely views over the beach.  Tasty small pizza with a cold cold beer. Only fault no wifi..  in 2019?"
Apr 2019,20,Hotel review,Facilities for kids were very poor - nothing for a 10 year old at all. Pools small and overcrowded. Beds hard. Drinks were over priced and there were long long queues for breakfast - dining room too small to accommodate the number of guests. The dining room at peak times was frenetic! On the whole not 5 star resort - I would give it a 3 star.
Apr 2019,50,Family holiday to the sun,Excellent check in service with brilliant porter service. Two different birthdays in our party were each marked by the Management Team which was a very touching idea and very much appreciated.Breakfast options were amazing especially the selection of cheese and cakes and of course the sparkling wine. The balcony of the ground floor rooms at front of hotel was really not usable but the convenience of those rooms to the central lobby was brilliant as was the actual room itself. Musical entertainment in the bar at night was top class. Overall experience was excellent.
Apr 2019,50,Superb hotel stay,"I though the hotel reviews might be over rated but we weren't disappointed. The resort was fabulous, we stated in the apartments which were very close to the hotel with no difference from the hotel in access to anything. Amazing to be so close to a beautiful beach and swimming pools at the same time. Will definitely will be back again, staff were really warm and very helpful. Very clean with our apartments serviced daily. Hazel & Dave, Ireland."
Apr 2019,50,Excellent location and facilities,"Great location, great breakfast, very good service, and reasonably priced for what is provided.  Was quiet at night.  Great views of the water.  Free parking available.  Close to excellent food and shopping."
Apr 2019,40,Great stay - little improvements needed,"Overall a great stay, beautiful location with a free shuttle to old and new town. Staff are helpful and polite. Breakfast logistics is bedlam! There is no order and people just push in and nudge you out of the way. There is plenty of variety, but all a little cold and over cooked. Other than this everything else was excellent. Very busy hotel, our room was facing car park with a lot of coming and going."
Apr 2019,20,Sea view rooms are misleading,We’re staying here at the moment. The hotel is okay BUT we booked a sea view room (and paid more) on the basis of the pictures on the website which show a complete sea view. The attached is what we can actually see! When we spoke to the reception about this the lady just said well that is a sea view (as you can see the sea to the side of the balcony) and offered a worse room as an alternative. They need to be more honest about the reality of the rooms.
Apr 2019,50,Top spot,"Great hotel also nice self catering apartments, well located on the beach close to shops and restaurants.Polite and efficient service, good breakfast and great ice cream.Busy pool area and quiet pool area.Plenty parking, really enjoyable visit."
Apr 2019,50,Easter Break,"Great hotel located in the beautiful part of Albufeira within the reach of old and new town by the shuttle bus provided by the hotel. Great service, spacious clean rooms, delicious food. Amazing beach. Friendly and helpful staff. Had a relaxing break and would definitely come back."
Apr 2019,30,Value stay,The location of the hotel is great. The hotel offers activities for kids and adults. The reception staff very helpful. The hotel can use a renovation - it’s missing that warm homey feel or investment in the property.  The beach restaurant staff was very unfriendly...my daughter asked to try flavors of icecream and after three tries was told no more. Sounds silly but she is a picky eater and wanted to be sure in her choice. The forgot my room key on the table and when I went back to retrieve it the table was cleaned - I asked the waitress if it was found and without truly acknowledging said “no”. The place has potential - it’s the uncaring lack of customer service vibe that throws you off.
Apr 2019,40,Lovely relaxing holiday,"Great location, staff friendly and helpful. Only thing that lets it down is no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Pools and resort very clean. Great Bus service to town. Beach is lovely and clean."
Apr 2019,10,Food very poor,Just back with my boyfriend from this hotel.  5star it is not. We didnt get a hot meal from we got there all our meals were luke warm or completely cold not impressed with selection either but what would that even matter as its too cold to eat.  Even on my last day i wanted something other than a fried breakfast as it was always freezing so went for porridge which was also cold.  If youve booked here i would stick to the fruit or the pure orange juice as its warmer that the cooked food.
Apr 2019,40,Relaxing Break away review,"We have stayed in the hotel 4 time previously and we love the hotel and specifically the location, service, beach and general relaxation of the rooms. This time (as we always do) we booked a seaview room but we had more of a ""Car Park"" view (room 225) than a sea view. This was a little disappointing as previously we loved , even in rainy weather, to look out at the beach from the room. With t his room in particular this was not possible without going outdoors. Overall we really love the Hotel and do plan to return again possibly later this year."
Apr 2019,40,Overall a very good trip,The only reason for 4 star is the apartment we were in could do with a little bit of maintenance (wall paper peeling off) & a bar staff member being quite abrupt. But others were very nice & helpful.There is a grassy open space in between the apartments where the pools are with a volleyball net and goal posts.The staff generally are very helpful and issues get fixed very quickly. We have been going here every Easter for the last five years and intend to return next year!
Apr 2019,30,A Stay in Portugal,We had a one bedroom apartment. The apartment was clean and quite spacious with a nice patio outside. We did not rent a car. It was quite a rough walk to carry groceries home from the store. I wish there had been a washing machine in the unit or a coin laundry onsite. For a 7 week stay it is too expensive to use the hotel laundry services.My husband had an accident and we had to leave early. The hotel staff and the guide for the group were extremely helpful. I would only return to this location if there was a stay at the hotel with a meal package. The hotel lobby and surrounding were lovely.In February the restaurants near the hotel were closed so I think March would be a much better month there.
Apr 2019,50,Absolute paradise,"From the moment we arrived we knew we had definitely picked the right place to stay! The hotel staff were very friendly and were really helpful with any questions we had, they recommend a few places and showed us directly to our room. The pool area is beautiful, the only annoying thing is people trying to reserve sun beds, no one is watching this and it was happening way too much, people would save beds and not be there for hours and come back and take their towels back..? Very frustrating for people looking for beds. I’m sure this happens anywhere you stay though. We had a balcony and this over looked the front carpark, still could chill on the balcony just not tonnes of sun on it. We had breakfast included and wow there was so much choice. Everyday we were so full and found going around 8-8.30 skipped the craziness of people, after 9 it can be a bit busy. The staff couldnt do more to be friendly and helpful and the food was amazing. We ate at both the burger bar and the restaurant that over looks the beach, both tasted amazing and were great value for money! Our room was very spacious, we were greeted with champagne on arrival to our room as we were celebrating a birthday which was so lovely. Even at 11pm on our arrival day they did this special little touch. We did have trouble with our safe as it ran out of space on the memory card and our stuff got locked inside, but instantly the reception team sent up security who were fantastic and sorted this out instantly. The private beach is honestly incredible...so quiet and beautiful. The free shuttle bus to old and new town is also a wonderful touch! Our only complaint is that the walls seem very thin we could hear next door and the hall way very clearly and on a couple of occasions did wake us up. Don’t let this put you off because honestly we couldn’t fault anything else, if you wanted you wouldn’t even have to leave the hotel, we didn’t for 2 days! The added touch of slippers and a robe is also very cute! The gym was great too and very good live music in the evenings, thank you for making our holiday perfect. Definitely would come back to stay here in a heart beat, absolutely amazing!"
Apr 2019,50,Recommended,"We very much liked our stay in Grande Real Eulalia Resort. We had one of the studios with kitchen, located outside of the main building. Service was excellent, room spacious and very nice. We barely used the hotel restaurants, which were all OK, but there are good choices close to the hotel as well where you can eat delicious fish...The kids club was really great for our son. The location is great, close to the beautiful beach."
Apr 2019,50,Amazing place best place I’ve been so far,"From the start of our trip tilll the end has been nothing but spectacular. This place is amazing, the food is fresh and delicious, literally everything about this place has had me in awe. The food, the beach, local attractions. Nothing but an amazing experience"
Apr 2019,40,Bit tired in some parts,Couldnt fault anything except some parts of the hotel looking a bit tired. All staff exceptional and very accommodating.  Breakfast was excellent  except for the bacon which was so hard you couldn't cut it. But there were so many other choices it didn't matter. I am still dreaming of the mini croissants. Even in France I've never had such good ones. We ate a few times in the hotel and everything was good.  The apartments were spacious and comfortable. Location was good. I'd definitely go back. Thanks to all the great staff.
Apr 2019,40,Another lovely stay,"This was our third stay at this hotel and since we first stayed it has in our opinion lost some of its sparkle and is beginning to look tired and in need of a freshen up. There are rumours that the hotel is being sold which would make sense as to why standards are slipping which is a shame as it could be beautiful. We were still happy with our week away, we treated ourselves to a suite but wouldn't bother with that again as you are in the shade quite early and with the winds it can be cold, however the jacuzzi bath was very nice. Good choice of food but if you are half board try a lunch instead of dinner as that is cooked to order rather than you having to queue at the buffet. All in all another lovely break in Portugal but we are tempted to book elsewhere next time."
Apr 2019,40,Great Location Great People,"We've just returned from 7 nights at this fab resort.  The people that work there really made our stay amazing, special shout out to the lade that cleaned our apartment 526 and the guy who puts the umbrellas out at the pool bar with the bow tie they were amazing kind people. The kids club was fantastic! I can't say enough good things about it great activities and movies. Location is fantastic can walk to a huge selection of restraunts and the stunning beach is on your doorstep. Apartments have everything you need and a a great size, they only downside was that's kids can not go in the indoor pool and because it rained for the first 3 days of our trip this was a bit if a downer."
Apr 2019,20,Poor Evening Buffet,We paid €60 for the evening buffet for 2 people .. it was of very poor quality.. there was a salad bar that had hardly any salad ! The choice of buffet food was very poor! I waited for my drink to arrive .. it finally arrived after I had finished my meal ! Not worth the money !
Apr 2019,40,Stay April 19,"This was our 5th visit to this hotel and we had a great 4 night holiday, brilliant hotel, staff and location. I would suggest the pool be heated and access to the spa pool on colder days.  Would be good to have fish/salmon available with the breakfast. If these small finishing touches could be arranged I would probably visit twice a year."
Apr 2019,50,Fantasic location,We've just stayed in the Grande Real for 11 night and were extremely impressed. Staff were so friendly and we requested room 127 which was a sea view suite and we got this room. The room was great for a family of 4. I will definitely be going back and recommend the hotel.
Apr 2019,50,Fantastic resort!!,"We came here for 5 days with the family! Found a great deal in April for Easter holidays.  Stayed in the 2 bedroom self catering apartment and added breakfast. Everything was great, great selection of fresh breakfast items. The beach is just there so perfect. We did some trips outside of resort too, visited old town for shopping and did the Algarve cave boat tour. Kids loved every minute of it all. Nice restaurants nearby as well and we took Uber everywhere. Highly recommend Grande Real Santa Eulália!! 😀🍹☀️"
Apr 2019,40,Lovely resort,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment for 5 days in April 2019. The apartment was excellent, 2 spacious bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a very nice kitchen/diner with balcony. The people in the resort were extremely helpful, pool was lovely although only one of the pools was heated and so the others were not used this time of year. The hotel has direct access to a very nice beach,  Would recommend self catering. The breakfast was just about worth it, but the lunch/dinner is not and getting an Uber cab into the old town for dinner is preferable.Overall, a lovely stay and would definitely consider coming back in the summer."
Apr 2019,40,Good Value for money beach resort,I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel.  The drinks in the lobby bar were quite expensive and the beds a little too hard.  Our room had a fantastic view of the beach with a large sunny balcony.  I would recommend this hotel for a relaxing break.
Apr 2019,50,Fabulous family resort,"Really nice resort for families with young kids. There is an all day kids club which runs many activities between 9-6, creative arts and craft etc. Age 3-12. Wonderful heated pool at the front of hotel. Perfectly warm in April even for the young kids. Direct access to a beautiful sandy beach. The beach really is perfect. Plenty of parking on site at the hotel too. At low tide you can take a nice walk to the next beach along the cliff side. The village Eulalia close by has lots of lovely shops and restaurants. The restaurants in the resort are slightly over priced and much better options lie within walking distance. The ATM at the resort charges 3.95euro each use. Yikes!!! There is a free ATM at Intermarché supermarket which is close by to the east of hotel."
Apr 2019,50,Absolutely Amazing,My first solo travelling experience and this was no doubt the best hotel I could have chosen. The staff were so friendly and helpful! They had loads of information on local tourist attractions and booked all my taxis for me. Absolutely loved it :)
Apr 2019,30,I expected more,"Positives point: location, reception, parking, kidness of the staffNegatives point: the sheets were never changed during the 6 day stay, thr barhroom was nit cleaned every day, the breakfast baco was inedible, too dry."
Apr 2019,40,4* not 5* but still a pleasant stay,"The hotel has gorgeous views of the sea and a lovely set of swimming pools outside. One is heated but was still too cold to use in the winter. The food is decent and the service is generally good, with smiling and friendly staff who clearly want to ensure the guests enjoy their time. My room was cleaned very well every day.  The wifi was excellent. I had a suite which was OK, but was essentially two rooms pushed together, one with a bed and one with a sofa, rather than a suite of rooms. The bathrooms have shower curtains, which is a pet peeve of mine, and the air conditioning didn't work particularly well. The 'king' beds are actually two single mattresses pushed together and a lot of the furniture doesn't feel like particularly good quality. My spa treatment was good and reasonably priced, but they charge around 20 euro to use the indoor thermal pools, where many of the jets were not working. In short it is a decent hotel in a beautiful location, but it's very much a mid-market leisure hotel rather than a luxury property - locations such as the Hilton Vilamoura far outweigh it. I have stayed in Grand Real hotels before, such as their Villa Italia in Cascais, which was incredibly, but the Satana Eulalia doesn't come close."
Apr 2019,50,another great stay,Knew what to expect from hotel and it didn't disappoint. Staff very well trained and service excellent. great location. Stayed bed and breakfast and there was plenty of choice. Restaurant staff very efficient in clearing up and very polite. Reception staff very helpful and approachable.
Apr 2019,50,Fabulous weekend stay with friends,"I stayed at this wonderful resort with four of my girl friends for a long weekend at the end of March.  We were very impressed with the customer service, cleanliness and hotel facilities in general. It was out of season so fairly quiet but nonetheless there was nothing to complain about. The rooms were spotlessly clean and quiet and we had the pool area to ourselves.  We didn't eat at the hotel apart from at the Atlantico restaurant which faced the beach and the food in there was very nice and reasonably priced.  The cocktails are to die for in the main bar of the hotel.  We visited the spa whilst we were there and you have to pay 3 euros for a swimming hat but that was also very nice and relaxing.  Everything you need is on your door step, you can walk to the new town/strip in 10 minutes and a taxi takes you to the old town in approx ten minutes.  Would highly recommend A Ruina restaurant in the old town which has wonderful views and you can choose your fish and seafood which they cook fresh on the grill. Would definitely return but perhaps when it's a little warmer."
Apr 2019,50,Wonderful stay.,We stayed in one of your one bedroom apartments for four weeks.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The resort has excellent facilities and is well located for all activities.  We have stayed here now three times and hope to return next year.
Apr 2019,30,nothing special,"my room was clean and had a reasonable size. but the blackout curtain did not prevent sunligth to get in. my room was facing the parking lot....breakfast was ok, but lactose free products weren't available and i needed to order 1 day in advance (!). at check out they asked me to pay more 100 and some euros more than the price i had in my booking, but they did correct ir after. but if i didn't remember or had complaint? how accurated should a 5 star hotel be? i did not liked as when they make mistakes they are the ones who always beneficts, not the client....."
Apr 2019,40,Great value for money,"spent a week in one of the houses,not main building.I Weloved the house.Especially the fully equipped kitchen.There is a nice supermarket nearby.Every morning we went there for fresh bread and groceries and then prepared breakfast ""at home"".Nice terrace also overlooking a quiet pool area.And Santa Eulalia beach itself is perfect.We went for HB although the food was a little tasteless.But outside the hotel I also could not find anything spectacular.Free shuttle to Albufeira several times a day.And the bus to Faro stops just outside the hotel.When looking around I thought I chose the best option by choosing this hotel.April is just a little cold,that was the only spoil.But heated pool outside"
Apr 2019,40,Very nice hotel wih nice beach!,"Very nice hotel with beautiful private beach (the big plus!) , breakfast ok but always exactely the same. Big rooms but we could hear our indian neighour every night so it was hard to sleep before they did!"
Apr 2019,50,Fabulous Hotel,Have stayed at this hotel 3 times now with different friends and family members each time and we have all thoroughly enjoyed our visits. Would return again and again. The rooms are very large and comfortable.Breakfast is exceptional.
Apr 2019,50,Wow!!!,"It was an amazing holiday in this hotel! First time in Portugal and the impression was the right one... From the rooms, to the service and the meal everything was very good! We would come back, cause it was a pleasant stay!"
Apr 2019,50,Portugal,"Third time at the Grand Real Santa Eulalia.  Love the hotel and stay there but the apartments where I stayed need a bit of freshening up, e.g. cracked kitchen counter, etc. Great water pressure.  The music in the lobby at night was unnecessary loud at times and card play or conversation was not easy."
Apr 2019,50,Lovely situated hotel,"When we booked this hotel, we did not expect such an impressing an nice building. The view from our balcony was extremely nice. And everybody was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was really nice and the evening buffet was Always extraordinary. We enjoyed our stay very much."
Apr 2019,50,Exclusiv Commodation,Absolutli top! Nice stay and big rooms. Very quiet. Verry good brekfast at the buffet. The service was verry kind and couteous. The room service was verry prompt and friendly. Nice strand restaurant with delices food. Fine beach.
Apr 2019,30,14 day stay in March 2019,"The overall staff members in each area are friendly, helpful and do their best to accommodate. Grounds - nice, but does need some updating in some areas.Beach - very nice, with fairly easy access by stairs. At low tide, you can walk quite far in both directions. ( CHECK tide charts first )Rooms ( we stayed in an apartment ) clean, decent amount of kitchenware, bed was very hard which made sleeping uncomfortable and the pillows were very small, good wifi service and tv cable service with 5-6 English channels. Housekeeping once a week. Two couches were comfortable.Buffet style restaurant - (we had included in our package breakfast and dinner here every day) large, clean eating area with outside patio. Large variety of food choices but our biggest disappointment was that most of the  food was always lukewarm to cold. Due to the location, there is a free hourly shuttle bus service to oldtown and newtown Albufeira, which we used quite a bit.  No laundry facilities onsite.Lounge entertainment 5 nights of the week."
Apr 2019,50,Great place for family,"All round very good especially for family The location, rooms, and services are all very good and would be happy to recommend to anyone wishing to visit this part of the country.Great for a five night stay in the room or apartment."
Apr 2019,10,NOT DOG FRIENDLY,"Visited their open air restaurant, for a snack,in a party of four adults (one wheelchair bound) and two very well groomed Shar Pei dogs. After struggling up a steep slope and short flight of steps, we were very quickly stopped ny a rather aloof restaurant employee who informed us that dogs are not allowed. Not wishing to make a fuss, and being a bit embarassed in front of the onlooking diners (many of whom were Dressed only in bathing suits), we politely made our way back down the very steep slope to the car park. It struck us that double standards are in play when an open air beachside restaurant, which welcomes people in bathing suits does not admit dogs. The wheelchair access is not great either. Quite disgraceful atually.On leaving the beach we went to another nearby restaurant, where the dogs were made very welcome,and even offered water with our drinks order. Now THAT IS class !"
Apr 2019,50,Lovely short break,"Stayed in one of the self catering apartments which was very spacious, colourful and clean, had all utensils that you needed (apart from washing up cloth and liquid). There are several pools on site each with their own bar, however due to time of year these weren’t open for us to use.  Super market was a short walk out to the right as you leave the the complex with a nice range of bars and restaurants a short walk to the left. Hotel runs a free shuttle service to both new and old town Albufeira serval times a day which comes in very handy if you fancy going out exploring. We had a very pleasant stay and would recommend this hotel for all ages. 😊"
Apr 2019,20,POOR  SPA  TREATMENT,"Recently returned from a trip to this hotel.  Have to say the weather was beautiful.  The hotel is well out from the new town and even further from the old town. The apartments were disappointing unclean and drafty.  The air conditioning was difficult to get right.  Shower over the bath was not warm and bath was very slippy.  They have a burger bar and burger and chips cost anything up to 19 euro. The spa was the most disappointing aspect of my trip.  I went for a sports massage costing 90 euro and for the price i was expecting a professional deep massage. Instead I got a very light touch massage and repeatedly had to request a deeper massage.  For the price and the reaction when I complained to the spa manageress and to the hotel, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.   Better and cheaper massages in the New town.  Urban pizza is fantastic value and unbelievably good food with home made deserts. Farnels  steak house is also great value Sirloin Steak chips rice  onions and salad with choice of sauce costing 11 euro. The Clay Oven is and Indian  restaurant and the food there is amazing.  All these can be found in the New Town.   The hotel itself does a buffet style dinner but there is nothing special about this it is the same buffet dinners you get anywhere abroad. I would recommend the Parasio De Albuferia in the New Town.  Its location is great and within walking distance to everywhere.  Also recommend Mcdonnels pub,  lady from Derry works there and she is very efficient  friendly and great at her job.  Good drink and good crack."
Apr 2019,30,Great View... Needs Refurbishing,"The view was great and service was prompt and friendly. The hallways smelled musty as well as our first room. The hallway rugs were also dirty. We finally got a better room that wasn’t  too bad, but the furniture is old and dated. It felt like a cabin from the 1970s. The beach was amazing...as well as the breakfast buffet... that must be why they get 5 stars. I would rate it less than 3!"
Apr 2019,50,Superb!!,A stunning resort in a perfect location. Facilities and staff were second to none and the apartment was very clean and airy. We didn't need it but the kids club looked amazing.  Would definitely go back!
Apr 2019,40,Quick Three Day Visit,"Booked this hotel for a mini break as the price for bed and breakfast was good.(off season).Check in staff very friendly and efficient and spent plenty of time explaining all  about the hotels different restaurants, pools ect. The room was fine with twin beds and a kettle was in the room, I had requested a kettle before arrival. We had a partial sea view room with a balcony. The room needed a little T.L.C. The armchair had a rip in it.Breakfast was good with a good selection of fresh fruit. breads. egg station and the usual fry.The private beach is lovely and is like a cove,,lovely for a walk after breakfast.The hotel runs a shuttle bus to the old town and the new town which is handy.I would stay here again and am looking forward to another longer visit."
Mar 2019,50,Excellent Hotel,Just back from an extremely enjoyable stay at this fantastic hotel.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpfull and I cannot fault any aspect of the service and facilities.  Cant wait to  return for another stay and can fully recommend this hotel to any would be visitors.
Mar 2019,50,"Beautifully situated, elegant hotel, with excellent food and many facilities","The hotel is situated on the outskirts of Albufeira, with a free shuttle bus into town for those looking for Brit company and shopping opportunities. But staying in the hotel is a better alternative as its facilities are extensive - several swimming pools, spa, restaurants and bars of different sorts (with excellent service and really good food). This is a good base for exploring all over the Algarve, with Faro, Tavira, Loulé, Silves and many other places of interest within easy reach. For nature-lovers there are unusual birds and beautiful Mediterranean flowers to be discovered too. The hotel is suitable for families with children, single travellers and groups of friends. There are also conference facilities.Heartily recommended."
Mar 2019,50,Wonderful hotel,"The hotel was clean, attractive, had a variety of very good restaurants and patient, polite and well-informed staff. The pool and leisure facilities were first-class, and the gardens attractive and well-kept."
Mar 2019,50,Lovely stay,"Gorgeous hotel. Staff friendly. Rooms very comfy. Would come again in a heartbeat. Bar staff weren't all that quick with serving drinks, shame as it was out of season.Entertainment aimed at OAPs.Loved our stay."
Mar 2019,50,Good hotel right on the beach,Very friendly staff great service massive bed but a bit hard very clean not everything open as we went in March but would recommend this hotel 20 mins walk to strip 30 to old town free bus from hotel through the day but none after 6.30pm
Mar 2019,40,We got what we paid for,"We have visited this hotel many times since it opened for lunches/dinners and always loved the location and friendliness of the staff.   When we saw a really good deal for a stay in March with an option for a sea view room we thought it was almost too good to be true, even in low season!   Whilst we enjoyed the hotel very much, the only redeeming feature about the room was the wonderful view from the balcony.  The rooms are tired and in desperate need of refurbishment.  The furniture upholstery is sad and grubby.  Housekeeping also reflected the feeling of tiredness and was very hit and miss.  The Cozinha restaurant where breakfast is served is also in need of a refurb.   As with many buffet restaurants, chairs constantly screech across tiled floors.  Food selection is excellent, let down only by the ""hot"" breakfast offered lukewarm at best!   Very good, smiling staff, tables cleared and re laid very quickly .  Highly recommend both the service and the food at the Pergula ""Burger"" restaurant.Overall we enjoyed our stay but would rather pay a little more for better rooms.  Will definately return when the rooms are a 5 star hotel standard."
Mar 2019,50,Just wonderful,"If you see it book it loved everything service was amazing room couldn't be cleaner location was great and I can't wait to go back, looking to book our wedding great free shuttle service and free buggy ride round complex, thank you santa elulia for a memorable holiday and see you again soon :)"
Mar 2019,50,Our recent break,"We had a fantastic short break, the hotel was brilliant and all the staff were so helpful, friendly and efficient - highly recommended. The location was fantastic, right next to the beach, we will definitely be back"
Mar 2019,40,March getaway with friends,"The views from the resort are spectacular and overall we felt qute comfortable stayng at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort for a month with our friends.There were a few issues that should be addressed...the room we were offered was not fit to occupy. It had been heavily smoked in.  This is a non smoking resort, at least we thought. We were moved to another room that night and again to another the next day...tiring after a long journey from Canada.  Smoking is an issue at the resort...people were smoking in food areas outside which made it impossible to eat outside and to enjoy the pool areas.  There should be designated smoking areas outside not all over.Secondly, we asked every day for a clothes rack to do our laundry.  We watched as newcomers got theirs before giving us one.  It took 3 weeks before we got one forcing us to spend part of our vacation in a laundry outside of the resort.  Also we were only given 1 shower towel each for 7 days of use, we were there for a month...using a towell for 7 days is not healthy nor acceptable especially with no towel rack to air them in the sun.  We asked for more towels and were told no.  The apartment needs an update and I understand that is coming but in the meantime the sofa and drapes should be cleaned..quite simply, they smell.Apart from the above...the staff were pleasant, the shuttle service is great, the food we did eat at the resort was very good and we enjoyed the entertainment. The main lobby area is lovely and inviting.With a few adjustments the resort could be a grand place to stay in Albufeira.  It's unfortunate that we experienced these setbacks and hopefully all will be corrected."
Mar 2019,30,So relaxing,"Hotel staff and facilities were really good. Room was cleaned daily and nothing was too much trouble.Food on first night we had to wait over 45 minutes for a pizza, dough was a prepared frozen one so the delay baffles me. Especially since we were the only people in the restaurant? Thought €23 for one hour in indoor pool was absolutely ludicrous also"
Mar 2019,50,High quality experience.,Great hotel and facilities. Staff are very helpfull and friendly. Large complex consisting of hotel rooms and self catering flats. Great restaurants with beautiful views onto the ocean. A high class of service.
Mar 2019,50,Always an amazing holiday,"We return to this hotel every year since we got married there in 2015. Besides being such a special place for us to return this hotel is perfect in every way. Its location is excellent . The staff are so attentive and cant do enough for you. The views are beautiful. The pools , beach access ,kids club, spa ,staff,breakfast,the grounds and the shuttle service to and from the old town are just some of the great things about it . Too much to mention. We cant wait to return this may again . Would highly reccomend for familys or couples."
Mar 2019,40,Nice property but was lacking in regular maintenance of gardens and walkways,"We stayed at one of their apartments for 28 days mid February to mid March. The reception staff and other employees were polite friendly and always helpful. The main hotel was always immaculate and the views of the beach and ocean were spectacular . However, The apartment we stayed in was definitely not 5 stars in our opinion. Also the grounds were very poorly maintained: For example:paint was peeling on the fence beside the front gate; the gardens were often filled with weeds and we never saw any evidence of anyone doing any garden maintenance whatsoever while we were there; the steps leading up to our row of apartments had broken glass on one of the steps and this was never removed the whole time we stayed there; and a number of cobblestone walkways were in need of repair."
Mar 2019,50,Birthday weekend,Fantastic hotel. Booked a 5 day holiday with a friend for my birthday. Hotel is immaculate and apartment we had was really lovely. Staff very friendly and on the day before we leave knock at the door with a birthday cake and champagne for my birthday compliments from the hotel What a lovely surprise!! Would definitely return!!!
Mar 2019,50,Fabulous!,Absolutely fabulous resort!  We had a one bedroom apartment on ground floor with garden view and terrace. Wonderful huge king size bed and tv in bedroom as well as living room.  Wifi throughout. Excellent kitchen facilities.  Maid service every day with very thorough cleaning and fresh towels. Very friendly and attentive staff throughout the resort and all had very good English. Beautiful beach just a few minutes walk from hotel.  We had a swimming pool to ourselves which was just a few metres from our apartment and there are more pools up at the hotel.  Shuttle buses to the old town and new town run all day from the hotel although we got taxis as they were so cheap. All in all a wonderful relaxing resort with everything you need right on the doorstep.  We'll definitely be back!
Mar 2019,50,Brilliant Holiday,"Absolutely lovely hotel , would highly recommend, very quiet,and mostly was older people .Beach beautiful,with its own lovely restaurant ,pool area also lovely ,again very quiet,pool was very cold ,but a few did brave it . We stayed in the hotel with breakfast included,which had lots of variety ,always hot ,also enjoyed the procceco every morning .spa really modern,with great gym ,amazing massages too .About a 10 min walk to lots of bars and restaurants and a curtesy bus though out the day to the old and new town .we had a fantastic week ."
Mar 2019,50,Excellent Stay from the beginning.,"The staff is awesome, making the experience better with such sympathy.The apartment was clean and well equipped.The big plus for us was the location, just meters away from the beach. And ir you want to go to the swimming pool, even better.The kids club is also incredible good. Nice people and full of activities"
Mar 2019,40,A grate relaxing holiday,"Perfectly located and plenty of opportunities for nice quiet days.In general, the hotel seems a bit worn, especially some of the outdoor area. Our room was worn, and chairs on the balcony were bad.Lovely breakfast. The beach restaurant can be recommended, nice service and good food. We aimed to relax and have lazy days and we got it. Can be recomended."
Mar 2019,50,Great hotel!,Lovely hotel!  The appartment we had had everything we needed. Loved that the hotel was right on the beach.  Lovely atmosphere.  Staff were friendly and professional.  Pool area lovely and clean.  Would definitely return.  Had a great week.
Mar 2019,30,Only stop in Portugal,My bias upfront is having spent a month in various cities in Spain at 4 and 5 star resorts this one doesn’t quite compare. The rooms are however very clean and quaint with housekeeping staff and front desk all very kind and helpful. Manager very easy to deal with and sincere. A negative is the dated hallways (wildly bright/tacky carpeting would elevate with flooring). The main areas are bright and well done. The seaview room/suite is a view of the sea and while really pretty is not without obstacles - ours was over the swimming pools which are noisy and others are over roof tops. The pics in the brochure a little misleading. The beach is many steps/ramps down from the hotel (all hotels in this area I suspect are the same).  So if you want seaside in the strictest sense this area not it. The hotel does provide a free shuttle to the restaurant part of town and the ‘old town’ which is otherwise about a $5E cab ride or hour long walk. However with the exception of a handful of shops they are selling dollar store quality goods at high prices considering most stuff is from South America and China. Very little comes from Portugal in this place. We are as I said biased because Spain was so hospitable and we found the prices in the tourist towns (Costa Del So) and Barcelona so much better with more authentic goods. AND we have not explored what I’m sure is a beautiful country in other areas less touristy. The ocean at the resort and along the coast is spectacular. Just not easy to get to.Re the pictures: hallway carpet and view of ocean from the camera taken at doorway of hotel room and view taken at the railing of room balcony.
Mar 2019,50,Fantastic Hotel Outstanding Value,"This hotel is highly recommended for outstanding quality, value and location.We were given a very warm welcome by the concierge Jerome Fernandez.We had booked a standard double sea view room but were rewarded an upgrade to a double room double bathroom and twin balcony suite 127.Room was fantastic with a huge 7' bed!We were on half board basis and given 7 meal vouchers to be exchanged for lunch or evening meal. This gave great flexibility of meal options.I highly recommend using the vouchers at lunch time which is a la cartè. The food at lunch was truly outstanding quality.The evening meal is buffet style and still excellent choice and quality but given a choice I would take a la cartè ever day.The hotel is in a great location with a short walk out of the back to a lovely sandy beach.Out of the gates left and a fifteen minute walk to the bars and restaurants of Santa Eulalia. Turn right and a few restaurants and a supermarket within ten minutes and a 9 hole golf complex at La Baia.The hotel has a number of well appointed bar and lounge areas and a Spa to relax in.We had a fantastic holiday made all the better by the attention to detail and support of the concierge Jerome.This was exemplified by the fact we were departing very early on our final day Jerome went that extra mile and arranged (free of charge) room service for breakfast before our departure.Well done Grande Real Santa Eulalia management and special thanks to Jerome Fernandez."
Mar 2019,50,"Peaceful location, very friendly service, amazing fitness classes and gym.","The highlight of my stay was making use of the gym and the free exercise classes, really great instructors who will push you to work hard but in a fun way. Also took advantage of a free Portuguese lesson on the first day which really helped with the basics and gave me some confidence to make some effort to not just default to English the whole time. Every member of staff I encountered was super friendly which made me feel very at home here.I stayed here for a week in one of the self catering apartments. I had booked a studio but they kindly upgraded me which meant I got a separate bedroom instead of just one open plan room. The apartment was very comfortable and clean, lots of space and the housekeeping staff did an amazing job of cleaning / tidying. The kitchen is basic but I managed to cook decent meals, plenty of pots and pans. I would recommend taking your own knife though if you plan on doing much chopping. The beach is glorious and you can get a decent cheap meal from the bar overlooking it.I loved it so much I am returning after a week !"
Mar 2019,50,This is now my favourite Albufeira Hotel by far,"Beautiful 5 star hotel with facilities to match. Staff very attentive at all levels. Food to die for, with variety every meal, plenty of it and delicously presented and flavoursome. The chef certainly knows how to cook! Large lounges and ample sunbeds in the veranda areas and around pools. Heated outdoors pool for March was a bonus. Bedrooms very well appointed too. East transport to centre of town extra- highly recommended."
Mar 2019,50,Great Place,"Our second visit here, and enjoying it even more. The self catering apartments are really big,colourful and very clean and comfortable. Everything is supplied, and our apartment had a tv in the living room and the bedroom. Great staff. Looking forward to a return to this beautiful place"
Mar 2019,50,Week in the sun,"Really lovely hotel just outside the new town. Very easy walk to the new town and a lovely longer walk to the beautiful old town. This hotel has brilliant amenities, the beach is spectacular, the rooms are lovely, clean, with very comfy beds. Had 1 night were our neighbours were very loud and had a bit of a party, the hotel sorted it immediately. Would recommend it for families and couples looking a relaxing break"
Mar 2019,40,Almost perfect holiday ........,Excellent 5* hotel in a lovely location adjacent to beautiful beach. Friendly and professional staff. We stayed in a 3rd floor sea view room that had an amazing view of the sea/beach.  Our only issue was with the food in the main restaurant that was served buffet style that we found to be not hot enough. Almost a perfect holiday
Mar 2019,40,Grand enough for the money,"A five-star hotel which needs a lick of paint in the bedrooms. We believe maintenance of the tlc sort is on hold because the property is being sold. However, the silver lining is that prices are very keen. Service is good too, as is the food."
Mar 2019,40,Great Hotel with good food and Lovely Views,"Lovely hotel with a free courtesy bus to take you to/from new and old towns during the day only. Easy check in with friendly helpful staff. Bedroom was large, clean and had air conditioning (we paid extra for the sea view, which was worth it). Great breakfast each morning which you could have in the dining room or take outside to the patio area to enjoy. There is a nice lounge area to relax in over coffee or to have a drink in the evening and a classy Burger restaurant too if you wanted a snack in the evening. Not all restaurant/bars areas were opened in March but plenty open for the guests there at that time of year...Though an ice cream vendor by the pools would have been nice to have during the day.  A card was given on arrival to receive towels daily to use by the pools. We had a lovely stay, with good value for money."
Mar 2019,30,Decent stay with some hiccups,"Its a good location with a  beautiful beach behind the hotel. My kids enjoyed going to the beach everyday. The restaurant at the private beach is very good. However, the restuarant within the hotel was very average.We had chosen apartment with self catering. Most of the time, we cooked ourselves. Only on few occasions, we ate there at hotel, but these werent impressive.Breakfast isnt that very standard. Christmas dinner was really ok, too overcrowded within the space.  Within a mile, you could walk to stores to get supermarket items for cooking. Kitchen istn that big. We had to buy pans in nearby store as the vessels kept within apartment were more like porcelain dishes.  The rooms were very cold as central heating doesnt work that well inside bedrooms whereas the living rooms were quite warm. We stayed in Winter. Thankfully, Housekeeping  provided with extra heater as the bedroom was awfully cold. Approaching the reception was a bit uncomfortable as they werent much helpful many times. Spa was good. There is Lot of space to walk around, get sunshine, at the lounge and abclnies facing the beach. View towards the beach is awaesome. There are small outdoor pools which are free. Indoor pool is linked with spa and needs payment. Overall, stay was ok.. with small hiccups, which were manageable."
Mar 2019,50,great hotel,super beach lovely pools  very clean and and very helpful staff  it has private beach hotel has its own coach that takes you to the strip or to the old town and arranged pick up times we will return again
Mar 2019,40,"Good 3 night break, excellent sea view at breakfast and swimming pool. Spacious and clean rooms","Stayed in March 2019, excellent sea view at breakfast and from swimming pool area. Hotels are clean and spacious. Only did bed and breakfast, other meals around between 20 and 30 euros per person which is on the expensive side, soft drinks are about 3 and beer starts at 4 euros. They have a free shuttle bus to new town and old town regularly every day which we used as the food and drink prices are cheaper outside of the resort. Did not use the spa as expensive to use a indoor warm pool for 20 euros. Best  thing about this hotel was the sea view."
Mar 2019,40,Very large resort,A spacious and grand resort but not very Portuguese.  You could be anywhere in North America.  Food and services are first class but there is little atmosphere of Europe.  You have to walk far from the various apartments to the main resort.  Food is bland and North American. Why bother coming when there are other resorts that make you feel like you are in Portugal.
Mar 2019,50,Fantastic hotel,"Wonderful hotel, great facilities and great staff who are extremely helpful. Breakfast is excellent. Shuttle bus runs to  and from the old town multiple times each day. Would highly recommend this hotel."
Mar 2019,40,Weekend break,"Stayed here for the weekend as a birthday treat for my partner. The hotel is beautifully appointed, clean and friendly. The room was tidy and the extra large bed a real treat.The only two things I could say would improve the hotel and stay would be to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room, I was disappointed I could not have a cup of tea first thing in the morning. The other issue was the scraping chairs in the dining room, I suggest the management look at spending some money investing in attaching ' pads' on the bottom of the chairs! It makes for a very unpleasant dining experience in the main restaurant. The acoustics in the main dining room are very disconcerting - particularly if one has hearing problems,  I could hear the conversations of diners sitting a long way away but I couldn't hear my partner's voice sitting opposite me! The other problem with the dining room is that the tables are very close together and it felt overcrowded. I think in the high season that would be a real issue."
Mar 2019,50,5* accom 0* entertainment,Hotel was spot on very welcoming staff Good prices aswell not to pricey However the entertainment on a night was absolute dire i think kareeoke would have been a better option than your local piss poor gutairist
Mar 2019,50,Lovely hotel with excellent facilities next to beautiful beach,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Our room had a beautiful view overlooking the beach and was clean and comfortable. The breakfast selection and quality were excellent and was worth getting up for. Staff were attentive and really friendly. The shuttle to and from the old town is such a good idea and made our choice to stay at this hotel so much easier. The hop on hop off bus also has a stop in the Santa Eulalia area close to hotel. There are a great variety of places to eat and drink at the resort and quality and service were all excellent. I loved the easy access to the beach, the small shop (selling snacks, water to beach accessories) and the snack bar overlooking the beautiful beach front. The musicians in the lobby each evening were brilliant  (we were really impressed by the standard) and it was a great way to relax and unwind with drinks. There are plenty of lovely restaurants within easy walking distance from the resort too. I would recommend this hotel and would love to stay here again."
Mar 2019,40,"Lovely Location, some things could be better...","First impressions when we arrived were that this hotel was in a lovely location with easy access to a picture perfect beach. Our room was also very nice and spacious and the reception staff were all friendly and helpful.There are a few things which could have made a pleasant stay wonderful. The room had no tea and coffee making facility. We found this odd and thought perhaps hot drinks were available at no cost elsewhere in the hotel, but unfortunately not. In a five star hotel you would expect some complimentary drinks with the room. The second issue we had was with the breakfast. All the usual options were available but we found the cooked breakfast foods (egg, sausage etc) seemed to lack seasoning; the cereals were stale; and the pancakes were a flop. Worst of all, the coffee came from a self-service machine which was just not good enough. I would however like to give special mention to the pastry chefs, as every morning there was a wide variety of wonderful pastries.Lastly, we were disappointed to find that the indoor pool was chargeable. Especially since the outdoor pools were a little to fresh to swim in during March. All in all, I'd say the hotel is very pleasant but could be so much more if the points above were improved upon."
Mar 2019,50,Good resort,"Really nice and relaxing resort, especially for a small family. There are plenty of activities to do and places to visit around.Being off season (Early March) only one swimming pool was heated, which is understandable but that also meant your options are limited.All in all, a great resort, will definitely come back again."
Mar 2019,50,What an amazing hotel!,"There’s so much I can say about Grande Real Santa Eulália, it is better then what it looks like in pictures. This hotel is beautiful and the staff are so helpful so kind and so well mannered. I visited with me husband, son who was 18months my two sisters and brother we honestly had the best stay. We had a studio and an apparement with pool and garden view and was the view lovely we loved loved loved it! The beach was a minute walk from the hotel the views was breath taking. Our week went by soo fast we all was very sad to leave if it wasn’t for work commitment we would of extend our stay. We only had breakfast at the hotel and the variety my god was so good we enjoyed the breakfast! The rooms was cleaned everyday the only thing was they didn’t change our bedding everyday or gave clean towels everyday but they did do a good job cleaning the rooms. The staff was ever so friendly and thank god they all spoke good English. We will definitely be visiting again in the future. I can’t recomned this hotel enough!! Before I went I read loads of reviews I did read the negative ones and was a little worried but I trust me there is nothing to be worried about. Thank you all at Geand Real Santa Eulália!"
Mar 2019,50,Beautiful Place,"Wrong time of year but the Hotel was fabulous. Staff were extremely friendly, hotel was spotlessly clean, food was brilliant. the beach below  the hotel was beautiful, the bus service into town was brilliant. Driving around the location was easy. Most definitely come back again."
Mar 2019,40,Holiday,Hôtel of very high report quality on winter.Réception very good.  Breakfast good but no réal orange juice. Swinming pool very bad. Seaview perfect.  Large Space inside the hôtel. Situation very good. Climatisation not well functioning.
Mar 2019,40,Great stay!,"Great staff and beach views. The staff put a lovely birthday surprise for my mum, which was greatly appreciated! The only faults I had were the room was dated and the pool by us was not heated, we were the only ones to brave it.Over all it was one of the best places I've stayed"
Mar 2019,50,Very very good hotel! We spent here a honeymoon) special thanks to the manager Jerome for help to make a surprise),"Very very good hotel! We spent here a honeymoon) special big thanks to the manager Jerome for help me to make a surprise for my husband, then I ask him to help me month ago from Moscow) we will really enjoy this hotel at all!"
Mar 2019,50,Berry four day break,"Hotel has an excellent position overlooking beach with gorgeous view of beach and sea as we sat and ate our breakfast on the restaursnt veranda. We were B and  B and the buffet style breakfast presented lots of options, with enough for all. Albufiera is about 40 mins walk away but hotel have free shuttle, where there are numerous restaurants, and a number alsi  closer to the hotel.Room very clean. Bed a tad hard. Other than lacking tea and coffee facilities in the room, the hotel was excellent value for money and clean throughout. Staff were very helpful and polite and did everything possible to assist  in making our stay Relaxing and enjoyable.Have already recommended to family and plan to return later in the year."
Mar 2019,40,"February13-march13, 2019","The property was lovely.  The staff were polite and generally helpful.  We generally found the food a little pricey.  We were disappointed in the wifi service cutting out frequently.  As well, I asked for an umbrella for my patio outside our apartment.  We had not side panel and our deck was fully exposed.   I was told yes, we will bring you one.  We enjoy sitting outside but our deck was very sunny with no shade. Not everyone wants to TAN.  After 24 hours, I called again in regards to the umbrella, and I was told no, that there are no umbrellas for the apartments.  Disappointing!  So we could not enjoy our patio area.  And we were there for a month."
Mar 2019,40,John & Karen,Overall was satisfactory. Cooking facilities inadequate as no oven.  Needs a proper stove and better and less expensive laundry facilities. Fan in bathroom did not work but was not aware until final three days. Umbrellas should be provided for balconies without an overhead covering.  Did not eat in the resorts restaurants as too expensive versus what was available locally.
Mar 2019,50,Excellent hotel with a beautiful view,We had a studio-apartment for 2 people. It was quiet and off season. We loved it. Everything was very clean and the staff was very kind. The view is spectacular. There was a salsa event in the weekend but it was fun and did not disturb our vacation.
Mar 2019,40,Spring Leisure Break,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Breakfast was excellent however we only eat dinner once in the main restaurant, the buffet was expensive and choice extremely limited. It certainly was not up to the standard we have experienced at other establishment, in Portugal and Spain, consequently we choose to eat out. Bar prices are quite expensive and a further encouragement to move out and explore other establishments."
Mar 2019,50,Superb holiday accomodation,Enjoyable stay in superb setting with excellent facilities and attentive friendly staff .who helped us to make the most of our short break.The hotel adjoins an excellent  beach with access to their own cafe providing an extensive selection of drinks and meals.
Mar 2019,40,Very enjoyable stay,"Great location, sea view room with fantastic view and lovely beach.Couple of negatives, rooms could do with a bit of an upgrade, buffet dinner quite expensive, drinks very expensive, beds really hard, steps to the beach could do with some maintenance.Notwithstanding this the positives outweigh any negatives. Staff were lovely, location, views and beach fantastic, free shuttle bus for old town and new town really useful. All in in all we had a great holiday here"
Mar 2019,50,Missing accessibility,"I use a power wheelchair. This hotel is beautiful, It has a clean accessible beach. We had a long stay holiday. We stayed in an apartment which was fairly accessible but the shower was not accessible. 28 days without a shower wasn't good. If a shower bench had been provided it would have been better. The grab bars are not easily used. The therapeutic pool does not have a lift to get in and out this proved to be a huge disappointment. The staff are friendly,& extremely helpful."
Mar 2019,50,It really is 5*,"Stayed here recently as a girls holiday in a group of 6 people, 2 people to a studio apartment for two nights. I’ll be honest, having travelled quite a bit around Europe I’ve become accustomed to their star rating not being equivalent to the same star rating as I would be used to in the UK. Therefore I wasn’t overly excited about this being a 5* hotel as I expected it to be closer to a 3* hotel standard. I was wrong! After prebooking transport, a private 8seater, through Travel Republic (£17pp return) it was a short 30minute drive until we arrived at the hotel from Faro airport. The hotel is a short 5minute taxi ride from new town (€5). I had friends who were staying in old town who said it was a €5 taxi ride from old town to new town so I’m guessing about €10 taxi ride from our hotel to old town but we only ever went to old town during the day and we used the complimentary hotel shuttle to do so- regular times, plenty of seats and you just catch it at the main doors. There is an area of shops and restaurants a short 10-15 minute walk from the hotel if you need to buy any food, water, alcohol etc. Just walk out the main entrance gates of the hotel and turn left.Check in (and check out) were both done by Ruben who was friendly, helpful, efficient and genuine, providing all necessary information and instantly making us feel welcome. Although we arrived at 11am one of our three studio apartments was available to check into already so we got driven to our room on these little golf buggy things (it was only a short 5minute walk to our room but it was a nice touch, and some areas of the resort would need the drive as it is massive!). Within the hour our other two apartments were ready as well. At the time of booking I had asked for the rooms to be beside each other if possible,and although we weren’t beside each other we were put very close to each other which I appreciated. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the studio apartments,really spacious and equipped with everything you could possibly need- fridge, hob, kettle, microwave, bottle of water and lots of complimentary toiletries. We had a balcony which looked over greenery and caught the sun for most of the day. Two single beds pushed together to form one massive double and a sofa bed as well. Plugs at the bedside. Good strong free WiFi. Negatives? The only full length mirror is in the darkest part of the apartment, by the door. A brighter light here would be ideal. And although everything else seemed very clean, the floor was not! Your feet was black in seconds. After check in we explored the resort, as mentioned above it is a massive area! There are three separate pool areas, two by the apartments- one pool to each area and both of these pools cold and nobody about them when we were there (out of season), the third pool area is at the main hotel area (if you go down the main stairs in the reception foyer you can’t miss them), there are two pools here, one cold and one heated. This pool area was the only one that was at all busy in our time there. You get a card which you exchange for fresh pool towels as you wish. There are several restaurants but tbh I can only comment on the snack bar down by the beach as this is the only one we used. There is a burger restaurant and a fancier restaurant I believe and a lobby bar. The snack bar is in a beautiful location overlooking the hotels private beach but catches the wind so if you’re there out of peak season I would bring a light jacket (you’ll definitely need it at nighttime!), it was anywhere between 18-22 degrees when we were there but it felt cooler with the wind. We were all a little disappointed with the food in the snack bar to be honest, I tried the lasagna which was just tasteless sauce and I had a ham and cheese toastie which had so much butter on it that’s all I could taste! My friends had the banana milkshake which they didn’t like, but my fruit smoothie was refreshing and the icecream was beautiful!! Word of warning- the main areas to walk are mainly cobbled as is the case in old and new town as well, so flats or wedge type heels are recommended. The beach is exclusive to the hotel and is beautiful, very clean, soft sand and when we were there very quiet. It’s your own little area of paradise. I was told there is beach sports available from April to October such as jet skiiing, banana boating etc. There are some areas of the hotel that were closed when we were there as it’s out of season but I imagine these are all open during the summer months. Most staff encountered were friendly and very good at their job. Reception would book taxis for us at our request. On our last night we were told we had to check out at 10am from the apartments but to ring in the morning and see if we could get late check out, when I did we were very lucky that one of our studio apartments were able to have late check out (to noon) so we stored our luggage here until noon,at which stage we were able to store our luggage behind reception, their storage room was full but the bags were behind a barrier so secure enough. The rate we got for our stay was incredibly good value for money and all of us left with the intention of coming back in the near future!"
Mar 2019,50,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed in one of the apartments and it was lovely. Spacious, well laid out, lovely terrace and everything needed for a relaxing holiday.  The facilities at the hotel are excellent and all the staff go the extra mile to ensure your stay is perfect.  Housekeeping is exceptional."
Mar 2019,50,Lovely stay and great hospitality,"Lovely stay At this lovely Resort & Hotel. Me and my partner enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff and concierge were very helpful and friendly- particularly Pedro at the front desk, offering us complimentary drinks as a surprise for our birthday celebrations. We would definitely be back! Close to the beach - about 5min walk and different pools to access. Breakfast was delicious with so much to choose from.The rooms were very spacious and replenishment was almost constant. Many restaurants along the pier serving excellent food and drinks. Loved it *****"
Mar 2019,40,lovely place !,"This is a lovely location with its beach. Rooms are spacious with suites having 2 toilets which is always lovely when you are staying with others.  One star less as restaurants' buffet was not great (not tasty) and no coffee or tea facilities in the suite ! Minibar/fridge was not equipped at all. No water. However, breakfast was great for the money and waiter service was fab!"
Mar 2019,50,Beautiful view!,We stayed for 3 nights in the beginning of March and are very pleased with the hotel and staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The weather was also very good and around 25° everyday. Local shops and bars a walking distance and a free bus from the hotel to the new and old town which was worth visiting. We would definitely recommend.
Mar 2019,50,A true gem,"The location of this hotel is stunning, a beautiful beach on your doorstep and other equally glorious beaches within easy walking distance.  Rooms, food and facilities were excellent, very large bed which was one of the most comfortable we've experienced, robes, towels and even beach towels were of superb quality.    The staff were friendly and helpful, nothing too much trouble.   Not too much evening entertainment or daytime activities which I presume was due to the time of year but since we were in a suite that was not a problem, English channels on TV."
Mar 2019,50,Highly recomended,"We stayed here for a week in March staying in the one bedroom apartments with the bright decor on a self catering basis.  The hotel complex is large and well located and the rooms were well equipped with everything that you need. This is a very nice hotel complex with the staff giving a 5* feel, but the general condition of the site is no higher than 4* due to numerous maintenance issues when exploring. Silly things like the condition of the decking areas, numerous tiles missing in the pools and run down areas on route to the beach.  I would also like to see more information in the rooms regarding the amenities and their location within the site, maybe a location map or sign posts. This complex is probably 15 years old and i would say is as built. All that said it is still a fantastic place to stay and would recommend it to anyone."
Mar 2019,40,Friendly and good location,Friendly staff and great location. Cleaningservice perfect! The apartments in need of refreshing and a renovating update. Wi-Fi works good in the lobby but really bad connection in the apartment if it's located a bit far from the actual hotel.
Mar 2019,40,Wonderful area - nice apartment,We stayed at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia for four weeks in a one bedroom apartment. The area is wonderful. Restaurants and grocery shopping in easy walking distance. The hotel also operates a shuttle into Albufeira four times daily which we used frequently. Our apartment was comfortable - it wasn't particularly clean when we arrived - the floors were quite dirty but after the first cleaning it wasn't as bad. The only negative thing was all the apartments have chairs that drag across the tiles and are quite noisy. We knew when our neighbours were up. Also the drawers in the closet were noisy. Overall it was an enjoyable stay.
Mar 2019,30,Here for 2 months Feb & March,We chose this 1 bedroom apartment to get away from the Canadian winter. To date the service is excellent and the apartment has just about everything you need. The decoration is a matter of choice.  It would be nice if the pool outside the apartments was heated - there is one on the hotel side. All the pools' deckings and steps to the beach need repairing. The weekly housekeeping is very good. We appreciate the daily shuttle to Old & New town Albufeira. There is plenty of outdoor and underground parking.Ladies: leave your heels at home. There is cobblestones sidewalks and some roads everywhere. Also to consider is that this part of country is quite hilly.We look forward to enjoying the sunshine and seaview for the rest of our stay.
Mar 2019,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia,Great resort vacation! Travelled with large contingent of Canadians. Wonderful service. Beautiful on-site beach. Walk or take hotel shuttle to Albufeira. Loved the entertainment. Best hotel in the area.
Mar 2019,50,My favorite place in Albufeira!!,This is the second time I have stayed at this beautiful complex First time self Catering this time B&B. The staff are wonderful and cant do enough for you. The food delicious and breakfast buffet you cant beat for choice. The beach bar service also wonderful and food excellent.  I would go back here in a heartbeat. Its a gem not to be passed by!! The staff are a delight and nothing is too much trouble.
Mar 2019,50,Very good stay,"Very nice room. Nice view of gardens with partial sea view. Breakfast was good. Flexi check-out. Just couple mins walk to the beach. Beach is amazing even in off peak season. Minor point,  The plug points were only placed away from the bedside lamps. There were no points near the bedside. Overall though a very good stay and we would definitely come back again."
Mar 2019,50,Portuguese Paradise,"Very enjoyable stay as a family with 2 small children. Very clean, comfortable rooms. Staff very friendly. Beautiful resort, beautiful beach. Only one heated pool and no heated children's pool, this was the only downside, but thanks to the perfection of everything else, we had a great holiday. The food was excellent, too - regional, interesting and fresh."
Mar 2019,50,"Great hotel, amazing location","Great hotel on the beach, amazing location. Very good facilities. The children were so happy at the kids club. It was our second year at the hotel and we’ll definitely go back in the future. We had a great time."
Mar 2019,50,PERFECT,"Booked this hotel for a mini break with my family and it’s absolutely beautiful! Spacious rooms , comfortable beds, and really friendly staff! Rooms get cleaned every day, with fresh towels and freshly made beds! Great value for money!!! Love the pool area and right on the beach too! Absolutely beautiful breathtaking views !!! Food at the bar is amazing, great atmosphere and great live music at night time! So chilled and relaxing!!! Loved everything about the hotel! Also awesome gym facilities, didn’t get to use the spa but looks great!! Free regular buses to old and new town!! Love the security of the hotel too makes you feel safe...Absolutely love this hotel! We will definitely be back ten out of ten!!!"
Mar 2019,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia,"We went to Albufeira for midterm break with the kids. Very happy we stayed in Grande real Santa Eulalia. We were in the resort suite and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff are very professional,kind and family friendly. Loved the food from the restaurant and the variety of food for breakfast. Our stay was excellent."
Feb 2019,50,Returned for a 5th time,"We love coming here during Feb half term, weather has been kind always returning with a bit of a tan. Kids love the heated outdoor pool and we enjoy sitting outside the cafe overlooking the beach, wonderfully relaxing. Hotel staff are the best. We stayed in an apartment which are fine, just a tad outdated but this won't stop us returning next year hence why rating if 4 for rooms"
Feb 2019,40,Holiday in Santa Eulalia,"We had a nice stay in this wonderful location.We love it, the hotel , portugal and the weather in february.The fresh fruits every day during  berakfast - wonderfulWe come since some years and will com ethe next years."
Feb 2019,50,"Excellent hotel service, location and food","We loved our stay. Excellent service, kindness, friendly staff. We were 2 Adult and 2 child and had plenty of things to do in the hotel and sorrounding area. We would come back to the same hotel if opportunity arrives."
Feb 2019,40,Top trip for toddlers!,"Excellent location, *really* great, friendly and interactive staff and overall facilities/amenities. However the hotels policy on food ""to go"" left us feeling a little short changed.For those with half/full board lunch/dinner vouchers; food CANNOT be taken to your room. We tried, offering to pay full room service charge, on nights where our LO wasn't feeling well but were refused. We missed 2 x prepaid dinners because of this policy. The vouchers were not refunded nor could they be transferred to other guests for use.This is something that would need to be redressed before we'd return."
Feb 2019,40,Quiet time.,"Massive suite, great views over beach.Great breakfast Gym small but functional February is quiet but the whole albufiera is quiet at this time.Room service was exceptional( Pizza so good we had it twice)Atlantico bar on the beach was relaxing."
Feb 2019,50,Superb beach side break,"Excellent short break. Impressive public areas, large comfortable bedroom, perfect location with direct access to a beautiful beach, great quality breakfast with lots of choice. Great service throughout. Would return without hesitation."
Feb 2019,50,Fabulous holiday,"This is a regular holiday for us now, every February. The staff are always extremely helpful and friendly, the hotel is lovely with the rooms being extremely clean and comfortable. We always book for breakfast as the choice and quality of the food is always superb and really sets us up for the day.I cannot recommend this hotel and staff highly enough, nothing is ever too much trouble."
Feb 2019,40,Short February Break,"We spent three nights at this lovely hotel during the February half-term.  As our stay was during the low season, our review is based on our ‘off peak’ experience.  Check-in was quick and uneventful - we were in our suite within minutes.  Ocean View The SuiteThe  bedroom was perfectly adequate with a genuine king size bed - not the two single beds joined together you find in some similar European hotels. There is a functional (albeit empty) minibar. It was lovely to have a small private balcony with a table and chairs from which to enjoy the sea view. The living area has a sofa bed as well as a small dining table and its own furnished balcony with ocean and pool views. The BathroomThere are two, yes two fully equipped bathrooms with full-size baths. This is really convenient for families or friends sharing a suite especially as the living area has its own storage and tv.  Perhaps the inclusion of its own minibar would make it complete.Breakfast and DinnerWe stayed on an half-board basis which for the most part was ok. Breakfast was adequate with sufficient choices of hot and cold food as well as fruits.  Dinner was less successful as only one buffet restaurant was included. Depending on your dietary preferences, you may be left feeling a little bit short changed with the offerings. A small glass of orange juice will set you back €4 - which if you’re dining as a family will add up.General overviewOverall, we scored the property a four as though it was clean, there were definite signs that it is showing its age and in need of a general renovation.  While we could appreciate that the decorative theme was in keeping with the sea side location, it perhaps wasn’t the best choice to use blue and white carpets in the corridors as there were obvious stains which detracted from the ambience. Notwithstanding the above, we would recommend this hotel for its convenience, staff, and easy access to the beach. We would certainly return in the off peak season."
Feb 2019,50,Great value off-season break,Being regular guests we can highly recommend the Grande Real Santa Eulália. The one bedroom apartments provide plenty of space for our family of 5. Every possible amenity is available on site including direct beach access. There are a few trip-advisor grumbles about paying extra for the spa but this is not unusual in our experience. Very much looking forward to our next visit!
Feb 2019,40,February Half Term Break,"Arriving at the hotel and check in was smooth. I chose the apartment which was very spacious and clean with daily cleaning. The bed was awesome.... The breakfast was not bad but the lunch A La Carte was so lovely. I booked half board ( breakfast and dinner) but the good thing was that you could swap your voucher for lunch, the dinner wasn't that fantastic to be honest. As per the kids club, it was fab my girls loved it and they are 9 and 7 yrs respectively. There are several outdoor swimming but one of them is heated. The hotel is situated right across the beach which was lovely. A supermarket is just about 5mins work from the hotel.Albufeira is such a lovely and peaceful destination for holiday. You cant go wrong coming on vacation to Grande Real."
Feb 2019,20,Disappointed .... not a great experience for us.,"I was not sure whether to award 3/5 or 2/5 but our experience at the end of the stay meant it had unfortunately had to be the latter. We are regular visitors to this part of the Algarve usually staying at a neighbouring property but this time we visited with a number of friends and their families who wanted a bit of luxury as there were a couple of recent birthdays and the reviews seemed very good.Our trip started quite well with a nice touch of each of our rooms being given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and we were allocated next to each other. However our 'sea view' booked rooms were actually side sea view rooms. The rooms themselves were a good size and are nicely furnished .... however we were joined by a good number of ants during our 3 night stay. There was a useful fridge and a kettle was supplied upon request but there was no complimentary tea or coffee. We struggled to control the air conditioning and so our room also became very warm at night which meant it was quite uncomfortable at times although the beds themselves were comfortable.The staff we met were very pleasant at reception, at the bar and for the most part at breakfast. However the lady who was cleaning our room couldn't raise a smile or return a greeting.Facilities - 20 euros for an hour to use the spa pool ... the only indoor heated pool at the hotel in Winter ..... is just wrong. If it had been for the full day it would have been expensive but more understandable. We were just not prepared to pay this and being quite cold outside in meant we were not prepared for the young children to venture into the heated outdoor pool in case they got a chill. Indeed there was very little in the hotel to keep children over I would say 4 years of age entertained. i.e. no corner with say a games console, I did not notice any table tennis or board games etc.On the day we left for home we had an early morning flight home which meant we would have to leave at the time the restaurant was open for breakfast at 7am. Given that we had paid for breakfast in the room rate my wife thought it should be possible to get some danish pastries and a takeaway drink to have in the car on the way to the airport. When she went to ask she was bluntly told that it was 'hotel policy' not to allow food to be taken out of the restaurant and so we had to leave without any breakfast of any sort. Breakfast on the other 2 mornings was very good and plentiful.Knowing what else is available in the area we would not return ourselves. A good quality 4 star often seems a better choice than a limited 5 star facility."
Feb 2019,50,Had a perfect time albeit not too many kids in the off season!,We got an amazing deal here and got very lucky with the weather. Not too many kids for our 2 year old but it was during school term so that's to be expected. As a result the kids club was pretty empty at times but the staff were great and more kids did come along.Loved the hotel. Great location. Amazing time!
Feb 2019,50,Take a chance and book Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa. You won't regret it !,"As always the staff at Grande real were superb, always going out of their way to make you comfortable. The facilities were  clean and in good condition. The SPA was fantastic, food was excellent and the view was gorgeous. It was very nice of the hotel to also give us a complementary bottle of champagne for my husband's birthday. Once again a fantastic experience. We will definitely be  there again soon."
Feb 2019,30,"Weekend break, b&b basis","Had a nice time here although have to admit we were disappointed that we were required to pay for sauna and steam room (€18 per hour)as it was located by thalassotherapy pool. There were no tea / coffee facilities in the rooms and one bottle of water was present upon arrival but having drunk this on day one it wasn’t replaced during our 3 night stay! The fridge/ mini- bar was empty with a card saying to contact reception if you wanted a drink, found this annoying in a five star resort! Surely some soft drinks and water could have been in fridge with the option to pay for them if consumed."
Feb 2019,50,Obrigado ,"Wow! Absolutely amazing! From the moment you arrive to your departure, you are made to feel welcomed, valued and special. The housekeeping was the best we have experienced anywhere and deserves this mention. The hotel and rooms are immaculate! We were always greeted with a smile and nothing was too much trouble. Our friends had a special birthday and arrived back to their room to find wine & cake - just perfect. The breakfast, the burger restaurant, the bar and all the staff we met were excellent. We shall certainly be returning, with the rest of our families. Well done and thank you all, we’ve had a very wonderful and perfect holiday."
Feb 2019,50,Amazing birthday trip,"We are just back from a weeks stay and had a wonderful time, beautiful hotel in a perfect location. We had a sea view room and loved relaxing on the balcony. Breakfast was lovely and had plenty of choice, the staff were friendly and helpful. Saturday was my husbands 40th birthday and although I didn’t directly inform anyone we came back to a birthday cake and a bottle of champagne in our room, such a thoughtful gesture, we will certainly be returning with our teenage sons. Many thanks for a wonderful relaxing holiday."
Feb 2019,50,Wonderful return stay,"Returned to stay for my partners birthday celebration. Again a wonderful stay was had. From arriving to departing everything was great. The friendliness of the staff. Comfort of the room. Amazing sea view (more than worth the supplement). Location is spot on, 15 minute walk to good supermarket and restaurants. The hotel sent a birthday cake and bottle of bubbly to the room on the day of partners birthday. A lovely touch. We then at a fantastic meal in the restaurant (Valentine’s Day menu). And returned to the room to find it decorated in a valentine theme and another bottle of bubbly. Attention to detail in this hotel is wonderful. Would highly recommend staying here and we can’t wait to return. Thank you for a wonderful holiday."
Feb 2019,50,Outstanding staff and great beach location,"This hotel offers an excellent experience! It is a peaceful, green, quiet location with a beautiful beachfront. The spa is great with an indoor Thelasso pool and there are several very good restaurants. The hotel is well maintained including the outdoor pool area overlooking the sea and you can choose between hotel rooms, studios and apartments, What I most appreciated is the staff, who go the extra mile. Pedro Junta, who did an outstanding check-in and on several occasions, went the extra mile to answer my questions and requests thoroughly!  Mfelda at the spa who was very kind and accommodating. Highly recommend this hotel. Thank you!"
Feb 2019,40,"Loved the hotel, avoid the buffett","Beautiful location, wonderful staff throughout the hotel, perfect room and even the weather played ball.stayed in the room overlooking the trees and sea, perfect in every way glad we couldn't get the front on sea view.Beach front bar is a great place to while away the hours overlooking the sea. great valenversary flowers/chocolate dipped fruit and bubbly arranged by the hotel. Staff really cant do enough.only rating 4 stars due to the very, very poor evening buffet, on a standard with the dross given out in the lesser red sea hotels. Very understanding restaurant manager wiped the cost of the food from our bill as it just could not be eaten. really odd as its not cheap and breakfast standard is very good. didn't bother the hotel restaurants after that, too many good places to eat a few minutes walk away.Would certainly go back just wouldn't eat there in the evening."
Feb 2019,50,Great stay in lovely setting,Lovely food with attentive staff. Rooms are light and airy. Beach is a short walk away. We traveled with two babies and staff were really helpful. Close to airport and a lovely location. Great stay and very well priced
Feb 2019,50,5 star service. ,"Well recommended hotel. Fantastic all round,well worth a visit and will be returning soon. Rooms,staff,service,food,bars,beach and the overall experience was first class. We had a sea view room and it really is a fantastic place to stay. Many thanks."
Feb 2019,50,Mini Getaway,"We needed to get away to recharge our batteries and some sunshine. This hotel accomplished both. We went self catering- it was just perfect and relaxing. The beach was just a couple of minutes away. But beware in February there are no deck chairs to sit on the beach, so you have to sit on a towel. The hotel and resort are a little out of the main area, which was perfect for us as all we wanted was peace and quiet. Overall an amazing well spent 4 days and would do it again hopefully very soon again."
Feb 2019,50,Beautiful hotel and location,"The hotel is well located, walking distance from the strip but in a nice quiet area. The room was well appointed and comfortable and the view was beautiful. We would certainly stay here again one day."
Feb 2019,50,Excellent place!!,This hotel was fabulous. The rooms were clean and the atmosphere great! The staff were extremely friendly and responsive to our needs. Would definitely visit them again and recommend them to friends and family alike!!
Feb 2019,40,Very nice,"All round great staff and location of the hotel is perfect only negative is being a 5 star the room did not have a kettle but overall love the staff and their professionalism, diffinently another visit in the future"
Feb 2019,40,Great Break,Well located 5 Star hotel with friendly and well trained staff.Well appointed and comfortable rooms.Good selection of restaurants with excellent breakfast.Beach restaurant has great snack food and good value.Faultless staff who were friendly and helpful. What a shame that guests did not have free access to all Spa & Wellness facilities.
Feb 2019,50,A fab week away,"We stayed at this hotel from 31st Jan 2019 for a week, the hotel is lovely with great access to a fabulous beach. Breakfast was good, my advice is to book in advance the day before as its €20 each on the day which is a bit expensive. For the evening, the food the bar is better than the restaurant. We stayed self catering and the only downside is that there is no where apart from the 15 min walk into the town, to get any things that you need. I know we were out of season, but there was no shop on site. There is a free bus to the old town which is really good. The staff were very friendly, housekeeping came in every day and replaced the towels. I would recommend this hotel for a good value holiday and we will be returning in the future."
Feb 2019,50,Fantastic mini break,"We stayed for 4 nights from the 4 to 8 February 2019.  We booked through On The Beach. From start to finish the entire holiday experience was truly outstanding. We arrived around 10:30am and were greeted with a beaming smile on reception. Here check in was swift and efficient. We were told all about the facilities that the hotel had to offer to include the leisure facilities, where to get food from as we were on a self catering basis and details about the courtesy bus the hotel put on. I read that check in was not until 2pm online so I said to the gentleman on reception that I understood that and we would wait to check in to the room. He said it’s no problem that we could check in straight away which was excellent. He then also told me our apartment had been upgraded to a 1 bedroom apartment complimentary to celebrate my birthday. We were so pleased and thankful for the very kind gesture. So then another gentleman arrived which was the porter to help us with our bags. We walked outside to a golf buggy which he took us in to drive over to our apartment. The complex is in its own private space and quite large. Our apartment was beautiful, spacious and very clean. Upon inspection there was everything you needed to comfortably stay on a self catering basis. Pots, pans, cutlery, microwave, a hob with extractor fan and even bottle opener, knives, chopping board we had everything. We used the courtesy bus. It ran at regular intervals from around 9am to 6:30pm. It does 2 stops, one near the strip with lots of bars, shops and restaurants and the other stop is down to the beach where there are great bars, shops and restaurants. The restaurants at the first stop are great as they are on the beach front so a great location. We are out every lunch time and dinner time we only had breakfast in the apartment. The maid came to service our apartment everyday. She did all the washing up and the usual housekeeping tasks to an extremely high standardNot that we went to watch TV but there was BBC1, ITV and plenty of news and sport channels. My boyfriend was elated with the various sports channels showing football 🙈 We used the gym it’s free. The equipment was adequate but as you expect they are a little dusty given they clearly are not used by many guests. We didn’t use the spa. I found it quite pricy.  To use the indoor pool and sauna it’s 20 euros for 1 hour maximum. I did not personally find that good value for money. We ate at the burger bar on our first night. The food was delicious. I had a veal burger with sweet potato chips and an apple cider. It was an offer for February with a price of 15 euros. My partner had a beef burger. The chips were to die for. The service was excellent. The bill came to 30 euros which wasn’t too bad for hotel prices. My birthday was on the 7th and we had been out all day and there was a knock at our door. They said it was room service. In walks a gentleman with a bottle of prosecco, a birthday cake, 2 champagne flutes, a card and some plates. The hotel had sent it all over for me complimentary and it was such a lovely surprise. I was very happy and it really topped off my birthday and made it that bit more memorable. The pools were just gorgeous. There were 4 that I counted to choose from. We didn’t swim in them as it was too cold but we did dip our feet in. There were plenty of sun beds to choose from. The hotel has its own private section of the beach. You have to walk down some easy steps and your there. It’s all very secure too. No Tom, Dick or Harry can wonder in as you need your room pass to get through the gates. The beach bar was lovely. Lots of seats to sit and enjoy a bite to eat with a very reasonably priced menu. The food was delicious. All in all this hotel was outstanding. Everything about it was excellent. The service, food, location, facilities, absolutely everything. We will be back next year to experience another fantastic holiday on the sun. Well done Grande Hotel Santa Eulalia for making our first trip to Santa Eulalia such a memorable and pleasurable experience."
Feb 2019,50,Amazing,Best hotel and resort I have ever stayed at.... hope to return for a very special ocassion next year.. thanks for all the help and advice Angela.. ( only recommendation would be to change the super bok for Sagres)the special spa treatment for couples was also amazing....can’t wait to return
Feb 2019,50,Great location.  Excellent service.  Definitely will visit again soon. Unfortunately I was visiting just one night.,Fantastic hotel in a great location.  The service was excellent the restaurant was good. Breakfast had many options for different meals.  I look forward to coming back during the summer months to enjoy the location.
Jan 2019,50,Very Enjoyable Stay,"We have no complaints - hotel was excellent ,  for us the sea view  on the third floor was just what we needed, so well worth paying for., idyllic views. - Enjoyed the  a la carte meals in the restaurant. .We cannot wait to make another visit. The courtesy bus to the Old and New Town was a bonus."
Jan 2019,50,Perfect stay,"I’m quite fussy but this superseded my expectations everything was perfect. I aim to return in September with a group of friends. Rooms were spotless with toweling robes and slippers provided, breathtaking sea view, fantastic food and the service from all staff was exceptional. A thoroughly relaxed short break."
Jan 2019,50,An excellent family holiday place would visit again and again,"Very relaxing place for a family holiday would recommend. The menus are delicious, very smart rooms and apartments. The members of stuff are very helpful and friendly. We have made this place our annual holiday place."
Jan 2019,50,Wonderful room and view,We loved our room and view of the beach. We had a relaxing stay.  The only two criticisms are a) the high cost for use of the indoor poolb) the quality of the pillowsStaff were always helpful and not over-officiousThe beach cafe is a useful feature especially as the temperature in January was not quite warm enough to lie on the beach though we did use the outdoor pool with a temperature of 27 which was only just adequate. 2 more degrees would have been lovely!
Jan 2019,50,Lovely hotel,"Hotel was lovely, for adults or children, room was large, clean with a lovely view, would have benefited from a walk in shower instead of over bath but that is a small negative, breakfast was excellent, something for everyone, dinner in main restaurant was very good but limited menu and a trifle expensive."
Jan 2019,40,Our three day stay,Room looked a bit tired bath needs re sealing around the bath this would make all the difference to the room and ones overall assessment. Just one other thing it would make the rooms much more welcoming if they had tea and coffee making facilities available.
Jan 2019,50,Another excellent stay,"This was our fourth stay at this hotel in the past five years - always in January to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We have always been lucky with the weather and this stay, from 11-18 Jan, was no exception. We love this hotel. The staff are helpful and polite, the hotel is very clean, the rooms are comfortable and if you are lucky enough to have a sea-view, it is spectacular. It is located  very handily for nearby Albufeira and there is a free bus service during the week. My only slight criticism of the rooms is that they don't appear to have been re-decorated in the five years since our first stay at this hotel and some of the decor is looking a little tired. That said, I would still certainly recommend this hotel and will be returning next year."
Jan 2019,40,Great stay at grande real Santa Eulália,Myself and my husband recently stayed at this hotel we really enjoyed it we found the staff very friendly and accommodating the hotel itself is stunning and the location is perfect we had a sea view room and would highly recommend it the views were amazing it was spotless and within walking distance from bars and restaurants which was great the only negatives we have are the bed was very hard and we found it hard to sleep some nights and there are no tea and coffee making facilities which I think is needed but overall it wouldn’t put us off we had a great stay and would definitely recommend it to family and friends Suzanne &Gareth lawless
Jan 2019,50,Great short break.,"Stayed here for three nights for part of my partners Birthday. Hotel provided a gift in the room on arrival. Rooms are spacious and spotless, great Seaview.Fantastic breakfast with a wide variety to choose from. Can't fault our stay."
Jan 2019,50,Visit to Algarve,Great location for our trip to Algarve.    We did not make use of the amenities available at the resort as we were there to sightsee around the area.  We did make use of the access to the beach as we enjoy a daily walk before setting out to see the area.
Jan 2019,50,100% 5 Star,"The staff were not only very helpful but friendly , greeting you with a smile on every occasion. Nothing was too much bother and were only too grateful to help. I can't recommend your hotel and staff enough and look forward to our next visit. You should be very proud of your organisation.Kind RegardsMichael Bridges"
Jan 2019,40,Friendly Atmosphere and Convenient Location,"We stayed for two weeks and enjoyed the hotel and conveniences. We were in a townhouse style accommodation which provided a sitting area, large bedroom and well stocked kitchenette. There was a private patio overlooking lawns and a pool. Shuttle service was available to the hotel where there were dining and bar facilities etc. There was a frequent shuttle service into Albufeira for shopping and tourist activities. The staff was very friendly. Overlall the facilities were well cared for but will require some updating fairly soon. It was very family friendly."
Jan 2019,50,Quiet and comfortable,"Stayed 4 nights at this hotel.  The bed was really comfortable.  The decor in the room is simple with basic furniture.  Hotel was built in 2004 and the bathroom is the easiest place to see the age.  We were there at the low season and the hotel was not even half full.  However, that does not affect the quality of the buffet breakfast offered.  There was a good variety and even sparkling wine for those who want champagne with breakfast!One minor complaint is that the wi-fi hardly worked in our room.  Every time I need to use the internet, I had to go down to the reception.  It was strange because our room was 2 floors right above the reception. There is a shuttle bus with 2 stops.  We did not take that because it was too late to catch the return trip.  So we opted to drive, which was not too far.  About 2 km from the hotel, there is a street which is full of restaurants.  There are plenty of free parking inside the resort."
Jan 2019,30,Tired hotel for a 5 star,"The hotel was tired and in need of a refresh.  We stayed here over New Year and there was very little to do.  The hotel had a New Years Eve party but it was by ticket admission only and they were all sold out by the time we got there - surely as a paying hotel guest, ticket admission should have been included? We were left with very little to do on New Years Eve.  The hotel had many bar and restaurant areas but only one was open - we were told this was because of the time of year.  Surely if the hotel is open, the facilities to go with it should be open too?  However, the food available was good. There wasn't much in the way of evening entertainment.  The location was a little remote.  The hotel did provide a shuttle bus service into the old town, but only Monday to Friday and only until 6.30pm. There was no shuttle service at the weekend so we used the local busses to get around.  Taxis were available and fairly priced also.  The room itself was average and looked out onto the car park.  There were no drinks provisions in the room itself (i.e tea/coffee).  All in all, I wouldn't go back - certainly not at this time of year.  If a hotel is open, it should be open, not half open, regardless of the season.  I wouldn't say this hotel warrants 5 start status."
Jan 2019,40,Nice Stay,"My wife and I stayed here for a week, overall the experience was very good.The room was clean and well laid out and the kitchen was really good, normally you get a hob with two rings that don't get hot enough, but in this case it was a proper electric hob which was great, the microwave also doubles up as an oven, but when I tried to do some oven chips in it, they came out a bit sogy and took quite a long time.We stayed in room 301, which was very well laid out and very clean, Beds were great and comfortable and we had no problem sleeping.The only 2 downsides of that particular room was that on an evening it got cold and although there is warm air from the air conditioning, there is a wall between where the A/C is and the living room, therefore the heat didn't get to the living space. The other downside was the small balcony, whhich also has the A/C unit on it.We didn't eat there so cannot comment on the food.Overall the hotel is very good and I recommend it, however, for us it was a bit far from the old town and in our opinion this is where you need to be as the restaurants seem a lot better."
Jan 2019,50,Good,Had a five day break with my wife and was very very impressedThe hotel was lovely and the staff were excellentNot too far away from old and new towns with a free shuttle service which helpsWill definitely be returning in april
Jan 2019,40,WiFi strong!/ efficient and friendly staff,"The welcome at reception was warm, professional and efficient. Reception staff reconfirmed my outgoing transfer on mym behalf because the office was closed and I had to leavel to go on an excursion. We were not able to check in early but stored our bags until 3pm. The room and bathroom were very spacious and mostly clean. There were hairs that weren't my own in the bathroom which were not cleaned before I arrived until 2 days into my stay and the chair by the window had suspicious stains on it!. The walls are paper thin between rooms. There is a safe, hair dryer, shower gel and body creams, shower cap, shoe shine cloth, sanitary bags and ""vanity"" stuff- ie. Cotton buds, cotton wipe. Towels were clean. WiFi was strong at all times, I had no problems.I was happy in general. The only improvements I would like would be for the gym to be open 24hours. I was often on excursions during the hours of 8am-8pm so I only managed to use it once for 15minutes. I would probably wouldn't have selected this hotel if I had known the gym opening hours beforehand. The spa massages are also a bit too expensive though the one I had was nice. The changing room had an unpleasant smell though. My friends used the other facilities and told me the jacuzzi water temperature was too cold. The staff within the spa were very courteous and helpful though. There were seagulls but not as many as I expected given previous reviews.Some of my excursions meant I had to leave before breakfast service. Room service delivered breakfast to my room on request, though It did not include any of the hot food options and the choice was limited in comparison to the breakfast offered in the restaurant.The breakfast selection wasn't clearly labelled for allergens but staff were able to inform me when I asked. The food is typical of most resorts. I was not sure if the oranges were local. I only ate the fruit and pastries so cannot comment on the hot foods.I would recommend booking excursions outside of the hotels reccommended ones which were a lot more expensive. There is a spot in the new town on the main road (I forget the name) but I paid 22Euros for the Lisbon day trip. The place is about a 4 minute walk from the hotel's free shuttle drip off point in the new town. You have to cross the road, walk back in the direction the shuttle came and take your first right and the place is on your left.This resort might be too expensive for me in the high season but it is a nice place to stay"
Jan 2019,50,New Year Break,"Great Hotel, The minor negatives were room did not get any Sun on balcony Rowing machine needs maintenance as in Chain/Bearing were noisy Only one of the outside pools appeared to be heated ..... the rest were colder than the Sea brrr"
Jan 2019,40,Xmas break,"Returned for my ninth visit to this hotel. Some refurbishment since my last visit - wooden floor in bedroom but nothing else I could see.  However the room was fine for me as the location with the sea-view was my prime reason for choosing the hotel.  Requests  I made prior to arriving were given which was much appreciated.   Everything was spotlessly clean with cleaners even washing cups and plates in room. Food in bar and restaurant still needs improving. Have to say that Christmas Eve buffet was exceptional with great food, wine and entertainment - more of this please !! All staff were very helpful and friendly, this is particularly important when you are a solo traveller as sometimes you can just feel invisible - this is not the case here. Love the location of this hotel and am sure will be back sometime in the future."
Jan 2019,40,Excellent choice,Very good resort. Apartment was very clean and had good stacked kitchen. Sad indoor pool is not available for kids. Beach side restaurant was really good. Breakfast is decent but hot options were only warm!
Jan 2019,30,4 star hotel disguising as 5 star,"The 5 star raying must be due to its location, spa facilities and own bus. The apartments are very dated and upon arrival ours smelled very musty as if no one had stayed in it for a while. We were overcharged by 160 euros at check out and had a lot of trouble to get refund which had to be in euro cash as they could not credit my card?"
Jan 2019,30,"Instant coffee machines, tasteless meals","This place is not better than a 1 star place regarding it's food and coffee. Service is OK, but the food for 10 days has been tasteless and boring. Instant coffee machines the worst so now travelling with my own coffee. This all adds up to an OK time instead of what was expected.  Toilet paper and hand towel paper just like the Parks department in National parks. Grey and rough. Clean rooms and some rooms have great sea views."
Jan 2019,50,2nd time and loved it,Food fabulous. Went for Xmas and everything was amazing. On a fabulous beach. Rooms in the apartments were so clean and spacious. We will definitely be returning. Shame that the spa wasn't in with the price though but apart from that we all loved it.
Jan 2019,30,"Friendly staff, but hotel can be uniquely frustrating.","The rooms were very clean, spacious and there were a number of TV channels. The beach view was impeccable. There is no facility to make tea in the room, which was peculiar for a five star hotel. What surprised us more was the front desk.We asked for a plate and an ashtray (for the balcony) and the reception promptly forgot. Asking them hours later they admitted to this and sent us a ramekin (good enough), but no plate or explanation. When asking the next day for the plate we were told they would charge us for an empty plate. They also suggested that we should ask the dinner service, which we did and they promptly directed us to the reception. It was a very singular experience at a supposedly five star hotel.The ingredients used for the food are very good, but many of the dishes are far too overcooked. This is especially a problem for fish like tuna which were rendered inedible. More troubling yet, there was a chilli for dinner on the 25 of December, the leftovers of which were used to make a moussaka the following day. This was very disappointing and the awful meals (Christmas meal was good though) detracted from our vacation.What was actually infuriating is that there were no beverages (I mean tap water or even juice) with dinner. I understand that this might be a nationwide norm, but at a five star hotel this came across very poorly. It left a far worse taste than the food. How is it remotely acceptable to not offer coffee or tea after dinner or with dessert? I should mention that they have live music five days a week which was really good. Filipe Neves, especially, was a remarkably talented musician.The bar in the foyer is very well stocked. When he was available Renato was able to make any sort of cocktail I could think of and he was a uniquely talented individual. These were easily the best mixed drinks I have ever had. Renato, Reuben (laurenco?) and Abel were amazing staff and if we were to return it would be because of our experiences with them."
Jan 2019,50,Beautiful location,We stayed here for 7 nights . Love the location as the beach is just one min walking distance from the hotel. All staff are extremely friendly and they are very good with our 1.5 year old son. Highly recommended !!
Dec 2018,50,Amazing Stay!,"Really nice stay, very polite staff at reception, kind housekeeping staff. Access to beach was really good and spacious accommodation. Definitely recommend this place. Not very far from local shops, old town etc"
Dec 2018,50,"Great family hotel, the staff are extremely courteous and helpful.","First time in the Algarve with my wife (whose birthday we were celebrating) and 2 sons. Stayed from 16th-26th Dec 2018 in the sea facing room 347.What can I say, one of the best holidays we've had as a family ! The hotel is a very welcoming environment, the staff are extremely courteous and accommodating. Although the entire staff were brilliant - few of the many names I recollect - the manager Pedro, the reception staff Jorge and the restaurant staff Alexandra were very helpful.We had the a la carte for a few days and the buffet on others. The variety and taste was of a very high standard.The outdoor facilities for children (pools, play area) were clean and tidy. The reception lobby and the space leading upto the pool and beach are very open and airy areas which we enjoyed as a family.The Santa Eulalia beach was one of the best in the Algarve - the beach is a short walk via the sea facing restaurant. We also spent Christmas at the resort where there was a special dinner for 2 nights and live music. It was good to see my son's requests being played.Sure the resort is showing it's age a little bit, but the location, staff, food and entertainment more than make up for that.We had a memorable 10 days, will not only recommend to friends and family, but will visit again !"
Dec 2018,50,Excellent,Had a lovely 3 days holiday in Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and hotel Spa for my Husbands Birthday The sea view and room was lovely and we had a relaxing time enjoying the view from our bedroom and the position of the hotel straight onto the beach we would recommend  this hotel
Dec 2018,50,Excellent customer service,"Excellent customer service. My room overlooking the beach, beautiful view. Love everything except that guests were required to pay to use indoor pool. It should be free in December because of the weather. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay. Thanks."
Dec 2018,40,Enjoyable stay.,"Very clean and well maintained hotel , rooms are spacious , plenty of toiletries , bath robes and slippers, only downside was no tea and coffee facilities in the room, free safe and also a fridge . Food at breakfast was good , only had one meal in the in the hotel as we ate out every day , the meal was ok. The free shuttle bus was excellent although it does not run weekends, would defiantly stay here again."
Dec 2018,50,Great Hotel,Great hotel but little entertainment a little out the way unless you hire a car. Hotel was clean and well serviced by staff. Would definitely stay agin but more in the busy season as not that much atmosphere.
Dec 2018,50,5-star quality and great price,"It was great visit of us at the hotel. We liked the room service, cleanliness and understanding of the manager for our request. We were compensated for our inconvenience genuinely. We were happy with our stay at the hotel."
Dec 2018,50,Lovely stay,We had a wonderful stay for 3 days. The location was perfect. Breakfast had both hot and cold spreads. The hotel also arranged for a birthday surprise with complimentary cake and sparkling wine . We would love to be back again. Thank you for making it a memorable trip.
Dec 2018,40,A birthday treat for my grandson,"This  is a very nice hotel, let down by the lack of an indoor pool for the winter months. a Gym that is only open during the SPA hours ( no early morning workout possible before break fast).The food in the Restaurant was very good, extensive choice for breakfast, we had the same dinner menu for 5 nights in a row. There was a lengthy power cut  one afternoon which went UN acknowledged  by the hotel staff to the guests, It left the corridors very dark, no emergency lighting.Could be serious in the middle of the night if the fire alarm went off and the power!"
Dec 2018,40,very good,very good hotel.stay was very enjoyable.late booking so pleased with everything.only problem at breakfast food was not hot enough...but apart from that would recommend the hotel.plenty of live entertainment at night.
Dec 2018,40,"Gorgeous Beach Location, Great Staff...",Enjoyed a brief stay at GRSE in Sept 2018. Lovely comfy beds and well appointed bedroom. The ease of access to beach & restaurants a major plus. Albufeira Shuttle bus convenient.. But surprised the hall corridor carpets were so dirty and tired looking which sadly let’s down what is otherwise a fab 5* Hotel with fab staff.
Dec 2018,40,Beautiful hotel; shame about the carpets ,"Beautiful hotel! Staff were so friendly and the rooms were very comfortable. The only negative I have to say is the carpets outside the hotel rooms are old and very stained which let's down the wonderful facilities this hotel has to offer. We stayed last year, this may have been rectified since our stay but at the time we just found this disappointing in a 5 star property."
Dec 2018,50,Spacious rooms brilliant location,"Staff were very friendly. Spacious rooms excellent value for money. Buffet breakfast was very good with good variety of food , however would have been better if there was more vegetarian options. Overall excellent!!!"
Dec 2018,50,holiday winter break,The best Hotel I have ever been in. It says star it is not to me it is a 10 star if that is possible. The staff are brilliant in reception and all over the hotel they would do anything for you..It is a minutes walk to a beautiful beach.We traveled at the end of November and it was nice and quite.
Dec 2018,50,Thank you for the nice stay,"a very nice and relaxing holiday. Thank you for the great serviceBreakfast with sparkling wine large selection at different prices, dinner very good, something for every taste.Rooms are very clean, nice big balcony with sea view, we had a very beautiful stay and will be back"
Dec 2018,40,December,"Great hotel and apartments, weather was amazing, but as to be expected almost all the attractions for leisure were closed at this time of year, which was unfortunate, I reckon this place would be an excellent resort in the height of summer for all types of holidays, young or old. I would personally go back and revisit in the summertime to see all of what could be on offer around the area, staff very friendly and answered all questions which are put to them, Hopefully see you next years guys, thankyou for my stay."
Dec 2018,40,"Nice stay, but a little improvement needed","I stayed here 4 nights. The breakfast was fantastic and the value was nice, but the service and facility of this hotel need a little improvement.There were a lot of noise from the aisle all the time and also some noise from the bed in the room.The biggest problem was that my room was not cleaned until 9 PM. Also some service I requested was not handled well and nobody knew the reasons."
Dec 2018,50,Can't wait to come back,Well what can I say I have now stayed in your hotel 5 times and have brought different family members with me. The sea view is out of this world the breakfast is fabulous we ate in the restaurant on two evenings and the food was delicious. The beach bar snacks are great too and it is all so convenient. This was our first trip to Albufeira in December time and I guess we were so lucky as it was 20 degrees everyday what more could you ask for. The shuttle bus is so handy and a great service. Can't wait to come back
Dec 2018,50,Perfect location and good service,Everithing was exelent . Very calm sourandings and friendly staff.If you choose seawiew you can go to sleep listening to  waves from the sea..The only thing we missed was kettle to make coffe or tea.
Dec 2018,50,great stay,"5 star service nice hotel, nice staff and great location set on the beach. spent a week here for my 50 th birthday ,upgraded on arrival to a sea view suit . nice touch on my birthday came back to room to find hotel left champagne and a cake . all in all lovely location, hotel and staff and a bonus sat around the pool in late November"
Dec 2018,40,Not five star!!,"This hotel is in a lovely area, and the views from pool area and beach bar are fabulous, with easy access to a lovely beach. As mentioned earlier staff are all so friendly and polite and rooms are clean and changed daily, however this is defo not a five star hotel as advertised. The bathroom is very dated (although clean) and room old fashioned, although my biggest gripe was the beds......they were so uncomfy.we stayed four nights, it was an anniversary break, and after second night we asked at reception could we change rooms as not only were beds so hard and uncomfy,they were two singles pushed together and kept coming apart. Receptionist who was lovely said every room is the same so not worth upgrading, and said they would put mattress topper on (which made no difference it was just another mattress protector on top of the original one). I now have a really aching back and am so tired and can't wait to sleep in my own bed tonight, I stay in hotels alot and this is probably the most uncomfy room I've ever stayed in and have come away from holiday shattered. The only reason I gave given four stars is the staff and hotels location and the breakfast was good ale, but would never recommend this hotel if you want a decent night sleep."
Dec 2018,40,Winter Getaway!,"Because of the time of year parts of hotel were not open ie. Pool Bars Club Kids club etc.The shuttle bus to and from the hotel is super, but would be great if it went on weekends! To use the thermal pool in the spa you had to pay an extra €20 (even though we paid for massages on that day) which we were very shocked over!Location is lovely - restaurants within walking distance are nothing special but going into Albufiera was great and also we ate mostly at the beach bar (food ok - pizza was from a box though)Staff were super nice.Beach hotel is on is devine! Small, but so gorgeous.We did self catering and apartment was spotless. Decor & couches very outdated but didn't mind everything worked.Could hear everything outside of bedroom windows so I'd imagine in summer you would hear alot - luckily we came during a quiet season."
Dec 2018,40,Lovely but needs financial investment,A hotel we like very much.A vast beachfront hotel with great facilities. Pool area with views of beach.Breakfast very good but did not dine at night as 30 euro is much too expensive for a hotel buffet esp in the middle of winter. Excellent restaurants up the road in Olhos d'Aqua with 3 course dinner with free house wine for around 10 euros. Many of the hotel restaurant's table are wobbly and this needs to be checked. Excellent staff smiling and with a will to please. Beautiful views from pool view rooms.Now for the not so good points!Rooms are not really up to 5*standard.Worn out furniture and new wooden floors that do not match the furniture style or colour.Bathroom again are from another era tired and dated.Unfortunately  i hate to say it but the only thing that's 5*here is the staff and the service they provide.
Dec 2018,40,Great Hotel!,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for 5 nights in October, could not fault the hotel it was pretty, clean, very tidy and the rooms were cleaned top to bottom every day, towels were replaced, beds made and even our clothes folded and any washing up we had left was done for us daily!We stayed in an apartment away from the main hotel this was not far from the main building.Food was good although we only had breakfast there. Location is pretty good, we got taxis to the strip most nights for about 5 euros, and went to zoomarine and the shopping centre all by taxi for a decent price. Only reason I marked this hotel down is because I felt there was not any onsite entertainment! Apart from that we had a lovely time!!"
Dec 2018,50,Bev W,"Just returned for a short 4 night break here. It was the first time we had been to Albufuria and were very impressed.  We stayed Wednesday to Sunday. We found the hotel to be just what we needed for a relaxing break. We had a garden view room which was nice. The room was of a lovely size and so were the beds although slightly on the hard side, they were certainly big enough with plenty of pillows. It was nice to stay in a hotel which provided enought coat hangers in a double room for 2 people. The rooms had bath robes and slippers which were a nice touch after a shower. However there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room which was the only downside to the rooms. You could order via room service however a coffee was around €2 which was ok, but the room service charge of €5 made for an expensive early morning  coffee.The hotel restaurants and bars were very nice. The breakfast provided a good selection and was of a good quality. The bar had a nice touch of providing ""nibbles"" when ordering afternoon drinks and again provided a good selection.We found all the staff very helpful and friendly. The service from start to fi ish including reception staff, room cleaning and restaurant/bar staff was all second to none. Unfortunately during our stay there was a large business conference on and the same could not be said about the delegates attending that who were down right rude and self orientated, however this is not the hotels fault. The location for us was exactly what we were looking for. It was right on the beach which provided excellent views and walks. The complimentary shuttle ride into both the old and new town was good however wasn't very frequent especially for returning. Local taxis were reasonable and cost between €4 and €8 depending on which part of the town you go to. Be warned though the taxis the hotel book are extortionate in comparison and seem to charge what they like.  Overall we were very impressed with our stay and are planning on returning very soon for another long weekend getaway. We will definately be trying a sea view room next time. Thank you for a wonderful relaxing long weekend break."
Dec 2018,50,Class Hotel at Great Price,If you are looking for a good hotel at great prices...look no further. Forget the Marbella's of Spain...over priced. This hotel has it all. If you are looking for a class hotel at prices which are great....hotel ..don't increase the prices...lol. Great prices in high season..forget Nice and Marbella...come here. If all in inclusive..forget the evening meal and go for the lunch instead...pure class.
Nov 2018,30,November not a good month!,"The free shuttle was unavailable. When staff were asked about this, they just shrugged. Taxi fare was 10€ round trip to the nearest bars and restaurants. This added 70 Euros to our stay. The Spa facilities at the hotel are NOT included in the price and are a very expensive edition. I asked about using the indoor heated pool as the weather outside was cold and I was told it would cost 80 Euros and I would have to complete all of the hydrotherapy spa stations, and there was a maximum time limit of 1 hour and 15 mins in the pool. Only 1 restaurant was open. NO tea/coffee making facilities in room and tea/coffee expensive to purchase from the bar. Staff didn't seem to care much about any of my concerns."
Nov 2018,50,Excellent Hotel with excellent service and very friendly staff. Great food in main restaurant and great bar in main lobb,Excellent Hotel with excellent 5star service. Food excellent in main restaurant and very friendly and polite staff. Great breakfast buffet with lots of variety. Even decaffeinated coffee option on machines. Spa treatments great. Avail of offers as normal price on the high side. 20mins walk to main strip. €3.80 in a taxi. Lovely beach cafe and nice small beach. Would highly recommend a stay here. Will be returning soon. Obrigado
Nov 2018,50,Great stay for business,"Beautiful hotel with lovely staff! I didn't use many of the facilities, other than for breakfast because I was only there for one night for business, however I will definitely be returning for leisure!"
Nov 2018,40,Great Value for money- off season.,"We stayed over a long weekend in November 2018. Perfect location but we had a car and could come and go as pleased. Beautiful, clean, large bedroom  amazing breakfast. Staff were dreadful in main restaurant at dinner time  we were literally left sitting there waiting to order for ages and then when our food finally arrived we were not approached once by any member of staff to enquire if we needed or wanted anything else.. ie water, drinks, dessert menu etc  it was the worst waiter service I've ever experienced. Needless to say we only had dinner there once and went further afield after that. Definitely not 5 star restaurant service but I can't knock the quality of the food which was lovely.  Staff simply need better managing. The indoor pool and sauna/steamroom was an extra cost of €20 per person for 1 hour which I found very expensive."
Nov 2018,50,Definitely recommend,Stayed here before and loved it so relaxing. returned to view venues in Portugal and booked this hotel for our wedding as we love it so much .staff are so friendly apartments are well equipped and cleaned everyday can’t wait to return
Nov 2018,50,Short Break,"Just back from a brief 4 night stay. Fantastic staff throughout, very attentive and friendly. The selection at breakfast was great with an abundance of fresh fruit and pastry options. It’s worth upgrading to the sea view as it is really spectacular. Just as a suggestion as the weather was quite mixed we opted to stay around the hotel. I know there is a games room during peak season but it would be great if there was a pool table or a few indoor activities for guests when the weather is bad. We also used the spa service which was great again very professional and courteous staff. Evening meals were also really good, we don’t normally eat in hotels in the evenings but again due to the weather and limited options nearby due to it being off season we chose to stay local and weren’t disappointed. All in all a great hotel in a peaceful location for a quiet get away. Really nice for a couples break this time of year. Will definitely return."
Nov 2018,50,November Stay,"Lovely Hotel with very nice Self catering rooms, comfortable and spacious. Very nice location away from the hub bub of the New town, Courtesy Bus provided to take guests to new/old town Taxi to/from old town 8Euros. Supermarket within walking distance."
Nov 2018,50,one small choice that you make for your clients,"Dear management team, I want to thank you for your effort, as we've really enjoy our stay, epecially the service and the location of the hotel. Nevertheless, in our opinion, there is on issue you can still work on and it's quite important one - how enviromental friendly you are. I found it very sad and dissapointing, that at Atlantico cafe the healthiest beverage, the smoothy, was being served only in plastic cups. We didn't order it for that reason. Believe me, it's a pain to sit there overlooking the ocean and having a drink from the huge one-way cup! As many of your visiters are from the northerb countries, I bet they might have an issue with that as well. Same with Nespresso at the lobby bar, by the way. It's neither cheep, nor good and most of the people got it by now. My hearthy advice to you is work on the quality of  your coffee (I had to switch to tea to avoid it, which is fine, but not for anyone) and get rif of plastic where possible. That will make you even the greatest place!Thank you and hopfully see you one day soon in Albufeira.Best regardsNatalia Zhukova"
Nov 2018,50,"Great hotel, lovely staff!","This is a beautiful hotel with lovely helpful staff.From checking in to checking out we didn't have a single problem. The Kids Club was especially helpful keeping our 3yr old daughter entertained with activities and games. I was surprised they were still open considering there was only 5 kids at the hotel that week. The rooms are lovely! We had the sea view suite which had a lovely view any time of the day. Was pleasantly surprised to find the suite had 2 large bathrooms in it which were cleaned daily... And the bed! I wish my bed at home was this comfortable. My only complaint was that there was no teas or coffees in the room, this is the first hotel I have been to in the world that didn't have teas and coffees or even a kettle in the room as standard. When I questioned this I was told I would need to order and pay for it via room service which I thought was really cheeky.Overall a lovely little break with the family."
Nov 2018,50,'Real' gem,"This is our second visit to this fabulous hotel and we are already looking to visit again next year. Fabulous location for a tranquil, relaxing holiday. Sea view rooms highly recommended. Staff are fabulous and can't do enough for you. Would highly recommend."
Nov 2018,50,2. time in Grande Real Santa Eulalia and not the last time ;-),"Top hotel, friendly and competent staff, clean rooms, direct beach location, very good and rich food, free shuttle bus into the city. Wellness area unfortunately not used, we will test the next visit."
Nov 2018,50,november stay at Grand Real Santa Elulia,my wife fell and broke ankle on first day. we still had a pleasant stay. hotel provided wheelchair. luckily we had half board in hotel. all staff were very helpful . food very good . would recommend this hotel
Nov 2018,50,Another lovely stay at Granda Real Santa Eulalia Resort,Last time we stay in the Hotel this time we stayed in their apartment and enjoyed it as much as the first time staff really helpful cant fault this resort thank you for a lovely stay yet again we will certainly be back in the nearer future
Nov 2018,50,Excellent,14th November 2018 john dublin ireland we stayed 5 nights the hotel is one of the best we stayed in and could not fault one thing staff and cleanliness was top class food and facilities were top class
Nov 2018,50,Love this resort,"Loved Many things about this place. Not sure where to start. The breath taking view of the beach, room cleanliness, great customer service of all employees and most importantly the smile on their faces that was just warm and welcoming.."
Nov 2018,40,Beach in Front,"Missed using of inside pool, no access for every hotel guest - only for SPA guest. The SPA Area isn't attractiv. We used the clean GYM. Outside pools very comfortably and generous. The Beach is directly in front and clean."
Nov 2018,50,Relaxing,"Love the place, friendly staff,relaxing environment could not ask for better. Wish I was still there, cant wait to be there again, hopefully next time get to do more things and stay a little longer I hope."
Nov 2018,40,Lunch by the beach,Stopped from lunch by the beach after exploring the area. Parked by the beach and walked up to the beach bar. Was served by a blonde haired lady who at first was very nice and delivered our food swiftly. We had burgers and steak baguette. The setting was really nice and was a busy bar. Once the lady was coming back to collect our food we were chatting to her and then she started a conversation with one of the other waiters. We found it very rude and unprofessional hence the 4 stars rather than the 5. Will come back as the food is nice.
Nov 2018,50,"Location, Location, Location","Total relaxation in a wonderful setting.  Excellent service, wonderful breakfast and a place to completely unwind. Would like to see upgrade in bedrooms especially much more comfortable beds.Housekeeping has been cutback."
Nov 2018,40,A Beautiful Location,"A lovely large hotel on the beach so location was great. A free bus is provided to take to the Strip and Old town. The choice for breakfast was superb - so much to choose from.The room was fine and beds comfortable although you have to pay extra for sea view side. Although there was a fridge provided there was no tea/coffee facilities which was disappointing for s 5 star rated hotel. We had an issue with air conditioner but to be fair they sent someone up right away to fix it. All the staff are very pleasant.There are no shops nearby unless you’re prepared to walk about 1km uphill. There are a couple of nice restaurants that I would recommend you try. The massages on the spa were lovely and the offer on when we were there was €45,"
Nov 2018,50,very good,"it was the second time we stayed in Grande real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel. the hotel is very good and the location is really beautiful. the rooms are large, the bathrooms to. The breakfast is very good; you can choose of many fresh food."
Nov 2018,40,"Lovely hotel , great location","We had a lovely suite with sea views, cleaned daily,2 bathrooms, 2TV sets, not that we watched them much, staff are helpful and efficient, food is typical hotel food, mostly fish, but always something to enjoy.The hotel does lack some atmosphere though, evening entertainment mediocre, but otherwise a good experience."
Nov 2018,50,Great resort hotel near Albufeira,I stayed here for a week in November to go cycling in the Algarve. It was very good as a central base and it was always nice to come back to the spacious apartment. We had half board and found the breakfast and evening dinner to be of very good quality and offered a very good variety of choices.
Nov 2018,50,Girls Holiday!,"Had a girls week away for half term and expected there to be a lot of families here but there really wasn’t many. A beautiful hotel, with fantastic, friendly staff, great food and gorgeous surroundings. We had a great apartment with a fantastic balcony that had sun on it all day and a lovely pool view it was very clean and spacious. There is nothing negative I can say about this hotel and as it was my first ever visit to Portugal I’d definitely come back again! Right on the private beach with several pools, one of which is heated. The hotel booked us a taxi several times too and we always had the same taxi driver, the lovely Nuno who was very friendly and made us feel very safe! We were a short taxi ride from the Strip and the Old town both of which had lots going on, but fairly quiet this time of year. I couldn’t recommend this hotel highly enough and will definitely come back again!"
Nov 2018,40,"Lovely, clean beach front hotel","We are on our last day of a week long stay at this hotel. Great first impressions of the hotel, the hotel is situated right on the beach literally a minute walk from the pool and a 15 minute walk to the new town (strip) the hotel do regular free buses to the new and old town which was a lovely added bonus. Rooms are clean and have everything you need, we stayed on the 3rd floor. We opted for full board, shame they didn't offer all inclusive. You are given food vouchers for lunch and dinner, this did make us feel slightly like a child at school Plenty of choice at breakfast, one slight critique would be the food seems to go cold fairly quick. We were a little confused at the 'rules' of the restaurant when it came to lunch but it turns out it's a full 3 course meal, the food at lunch was amazing and lived up to the 5 star rating, salmon and steak for lunch every day and cooked to perfection, one of the best meals I've ever had and consistently good. Buffet food was available in the evening, I don't feel it's catered to the British very much but then maybe I'm just a bit fussy, I still couldn't fault the effort the chefs put into the dishes and the displays, offering octopus and all sorts. I still found a good 3 options each night despite being fussy, again food could do with being slightly warmer. The puddings are brilliant too especially the lavender panacotta! We were not blessed with the warm weather so did not get any use out of the pool despite it being heated it could have done with being a bit warmer. Plenty sun beds and outdoor tables to eat at though. The reason this hotel lost a star is due to being disappointed the indoor pool is only available if you pay for the spa and the lack of evening entertainment. Just a guy on the guitar every night, he was good but the hotel was definitely lacking for this reason. The hotel is used a lot by the locals for events, there seemed to be some herbalife promotion going on and you often felt out of place and under dressed with everyone walking around. Saying all this I would still recommend this hotel to family and friends but just leave the hotel at night for entertainment. In November the nightlife is so limited although we did find a few bars to stop at. Needed a bit more for a couple around the age of 30 to do."
Nov 2018,30,More like a nice hotel than a resort,"The Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel is one of those accommodations conveniently located right by the Santa Eulália beach. However, it was very hard for me to justify describing this place as a resort.Location:The resort is located in Albufeira but away from the city center (which is about a 15-minute walk), but there are some restaurants nearby.Room:We got a lovely one-bedroom apartment, meaning that there was a dedicated bedroom, in addition to the living room/kitchen area. Both the bedroom and living area had its own TV.Closet & storage space:There were two closets in the room, which was very much appreciated for 2 people. One was in the bedroom while the other was in the living area. Each closet was not wide, but big enough to hang about 8 clothes as well as 4 drawers to keep folded itemsBathroom:The bathroom has an automatic ventilation fan, which turns off automatically after a certain period of time. It was large and fully stocked, with plenty of counter space. The bathtub drain was a bit slow but the shower worked well with adequate water pressure.Work Desk:There was a small work desk in bedroom, which was right by the door so any desk work was done in the kitchen on the round kitchen table which had a lot more free space.Night Stand:There are night stands on both sides of the king size bed. I also appreciated the number of electrical outlets which made charging our electronics worry free.Safe:The safe is in the closet, which worked well.Climate Control:The climate control was in both the kitchen and bedroom. It kept the temperature at 22 degrees Celsius very well.Kitchen:The kitchen was fully equipped with a sink, refrigerator, 4-burner stove, kettle, and plenty of glasses, plates, bowls, pot, and pans. We even appreciated the maid washing our dishes and pans while we were out for the day.Exterior Noise:There is not much soundproofing so there were some nights or early morning when we were able to hear people talking outside.Wi-Fi:The wi-fi worked very well throughout the whole room.Elevators:Visiting our friends staying at another part of the resort required taking the elevators, which responded quickly.Check-in and Check-out:Check in and check out were polite. The staff answered all our questions.Lobby:The lobby is vast, which includes a bar/restaurant in the back. I was rather put off by the rude reception I got at the bar when I wanted a simple orange drink. Breakfast:Some room rates include the breakfast buffet while others do not. We opted to try it for one day but felt it was not worth the cost. There is plenty of food but none of it was cooked to the standard one expects from a resort.Parking:We did notice on-site parking but the amount of space is limited.Pools:In addition to the beach, the resort also has two pools (one for children, one for adults) with many deck chairs around.Overall:As much as it looked nice, I really felt disappointed by the Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel; I guess I was expecting more when I see the word resort. If you are just planning some quiet time on the beach during your stay here, you should be satisfied. If you are looking for more than that, it will be a challenge."
Nov 2018,40,Long Weekend stay,"The booking in was smooth, the room was very clean, the bed was fantastic, I can't comment on the restaurant food but the breakfast was fine.  The Spa treatment was lovely, would definitely stay again."
Nov 2018,50,Ladies week away,"What a great place to stay ! Food excellent although a little warmer and a bit more vegetarian choice would be great ! Nice Buck’s Fizz option at breakfast (after all we were on holiday 🥂) . The staff are so friendly and helpful from , booking in to room service, to checking out . Faultless. Pools are beautiful and kept immaculate at all times . We stayed in the apartments which were great and spacious, although a little tired but very clean and housekeeping was top standard. Will definitely be returning."
Nov 2018,50,Luxury good value hotel in Albufeira,"We stayed 3 nights in a resort-facing suite in the main building. Can't fault the service and the room. Breakfast choices each day was quite similar, however you had a lot to choose from so you could try something different each day. The Santa Eulalia beach was one of the most beautiful beaches in Albufeira and was a 3 minute walk from the resort and it had direct access through a back gate. The free shuttle to the new town and old town was an added bonus as the location isn't great. However, the last bus was at 18:10 so you could take a taxi back, which was under €8"
Nov 2018,50,"Large gated complex with hotel central, beautiful location and welcoming staff","Overall a lovely holiday, pity we didn't get the best of weather although didn't expect much at that time of year. The hotel itself is stunning and great location. The apartments very big and well maintained by regular visits from maids. Some small area's could do with attention but overall lovely. We had 1st floor apartment, one bedroom, lounge could sleep 4 kids easily, good range of cooking facilities, terrace got the sun all day. Would be perfect for family over looking grass area to play and over looking pool and view out to the sea. Private bus into Albufeira shopping / strip and Old town, basically each hour.. I have already recommended to my younger brother and sister, to take their younger children. Great holiday, thank you and hopefully explore more in the future."
Nov 2018,50,Spacious clean bedrooms,"We had a Sea view room at the hotel, gorgeous view and incredibly clean room. We were celebrating our honeymoon and unfortunately no tea at included so if you are celebrating an occasion (considering it's a 5 star hotel) don't expect special surprises. Other wise everything else was perfect. I would stay here again"
Nov 2018,20,What a pity,"A wonderful location but the hotel and services are really poor Even the reviews requests are quite strange I have to write minimum 200 characters ...The room smelled dump and humidity the restaurant quality really poor for a 5 starsWe payed for full board but we didn’t have 2 lunches there, when we did check out any discount has been applied"
Nov 2018,50,Super hotel,"Hotel in a stunning beachfront location with direct access to beach. Beautiful entrance and reception with lovely ,friendly helpful staff. Was upgraded to a suite which was huge, spotlessly clean and well equipped with two bathrooms, two televisions, two balconies, a fridge and great sofa and table. Breakfast was included and just fantastic with wide selection of super fresh and super tasty food. Great outdoor pools and indoor pool .All in all MAGNIFICENT!"
Nov 2018,30,Not 5 star amenities,"It is a nice hotel, but it lacks character, apart from the pools and beach their isnt much to do in the day and the night entertainment is almost non existant. we went to the hotel next door which had much more entertaiment laid on.( and the drinks and food were much cheaper )"
Nov 2018,30,Wonderful hotel and breakfast but room service is debatable,"Room was comfortable, breakfast wonderful, didn't change the bin liner in bathroom for 4 day until we asked, forgot towels in room 2 times. Location with private beach was excellent. When we arrived you didn't have our booking, a mix up between hotel and agent, we had paid in advance, the employee at front desk was so upset, after sorting the problem avoided us for the rest of our stay. All others at front desk were most kind and helpful."
Nov 2018,20,Very Disappointed ,We booked a one bedroom apartment to stay here as it looked amazing & had fantastic reviews. It was booked in September & we emailed to explain this holiday was to celebrate our 40th  wedding anniversary in November & that we would really appreciate if we could be allocated a nice apartment for this special holiday. We received a reply email very promptly saying that they would do there best to allocate an apartment with a good view & location & we were confident that with over 100 apartments they would find us a nice one. We arrived on 1/11/18 and were extremely disappointed when we were shown our apartment. It was at the back of the site very close to a main road & behind an Italian restaurant. A first floor apartment with a tiny balcony looking directly onto the back of some other apartments and a service road. The apartment was clean & well decorated & has everything we needed but having looked round the site we feel we have probably got one of the less desirable apartments. A shame when it is such a special holiday.
Nov 2018,40,Families welcome,"It is a huge property with lots of activities for kids from Kids Club to swimming pools. The private access to the beach is also convenient. One can spend most of their vacation chilling around the resort and not get bored. The apartments are not in the same building as the main reception, restaurant etc but a short walking distance away. Breakfast spread is nice. The staff is very freindly and most of them are ready to help. They even arranged for a surprise drink(apple juice) and cake for my child's birthday. Definitely recommend for a laid back holiday"
Nov 2018,50,A huge thank you for taking amazing care of my parents,"I've booked my parents stay at Grande Real Santa Eularia Resort for 3 nights in September.  They had an amazing time staying at the resort.  A few highlights:1) my dad fell and injured his leg at the train station and ended up with stitches.  The staff was very kind to them, helped them with booking uber to the doctor and to town.2) staff helped them with charger for the phone3) breakfast buffet was amazing4) rooms were great--large5) beautiful pool area6) the beach was amazing and short walk. A special thank you to Rafael at reception.  He was very helpful and kind to my parents.We all hope to visit again soon."
Nov 2018,50,Family holiday,"Great resort, and great value if you pick the time of year carefully. 2 bed apartments are great, pools fantastic and amazing views to sea - beach bar is a perfect spot too - all in all it's great and we're hoping to go back"
Nov 2018,50,Overall very good except 1 male chef on omelette duty kept ignoring guests and had to be called a number of times,"Only complaint was male chef on omelette duty kept ignoring clients and had to be called a number of times for service. Also all staff should wear name tags in a 5 star hotel. Location great, but Evening entertainment was dreadful, and consisted of guitar players playing their own unknown music, awful,awful and awful"
Nov 2018,40,Hotel stay for a wedding,"Absolutely fantastic wedding venue.  The only negative comment about the hotel is the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room, which I expected as standard, especially as this is a five star hotel."
Oct 2018,50,Outstanding hotel,Outstanding location and outstanding service. The beach was breathtaking. The staff in particular Ines and Elizabeth were excellent. Our one bed self catering apartment had excellent facilities.Temperature were 24 degrees so had swim in the heated outdoor pools! Will definitely return!Will definitely come back when it’s bit warmer.
Oct 2018,30,"Average hotel, poor service & definitely not five stars","My husband and I came here for 9 nights mid-Sept and overall had a very relaxing holiday. The weather was perfect and the hotel was next to a beach which was really lovely. The hotel rooms are way below 5-Star standard and the hotel staff service is underwhelming. Overall staff didn’t go above and beyond, not super friendly, food overpriced in the hotel and most definitely not a 5-Star hotel.Albufeira itself is not a location I would return to. A few too many people on holiday just to get pissed drunk which takes away from the feeling you’re in a different country. If clubs are not your thing, don’t come to albufeira. If you’re looking for a 5-star hotel with 5-star service, don’t choose this one."
Oct 2018,50,Great location next to the beach and good quality resort,"good hotel and resort close to new town and a stones throw from the beach...we enjoyed our stay with our daughter. nice and friendly staff and good amenities in the resort. only thing rooms could have been better cleaned as we saw that our balcony was not hoovered regularly. also though we did not specifically ask but were hoping for a couple of sheet changes in the 8 day stay, we had."
Oct 2018,50,October Break,"An excellent hotel in a beautiful location with pleasant, efficient and friendly staff. We stayed half board and found the breakfast to be 1st class with a good variety, a perfect start to the day. Evening meal was a little sparse on variety, dissapointed by having to pay for water with the meal and in the room. Only one restuarant available in the evening which was again disappointing."
Oct 2018,50,Family trip in October,"What I liked:Hotel location (on the beach). Size - it's a good size to walk around and have space.Heated pool is perfect for October.Spa!Kids club - they were very friendly and my daughters (5-6) wanted to go every day.Food was very good - though we only really tried the sandwiches at lunch (no breakfast or dinner buffets, we ate breakfast in the apartment and had dinner in nearby restaurants).THe only thing I disliked was the bed mattress which was much too hard!"
Oct 2018,50,Costa del Folk Festival 2nd visit - see you again next year,"Fantastic Hotel, super design and layout, great food, and wonderful helpful staff.  We had a Seaview Room again this year, it was comfortable, clean, and the daily service was impeccable.  Giant and really comfortable double bed.  Amazing breakfast buffet and a good evening dinner buffet.  As a vegetarian I had no trouble finding enough to eat without having to ask for any special treatment.  Sometimes I pinched the vegetables from the meat dishes as well ! The choice of fresh fruit at Breakfast and Dinner was excellent.  Good choice of desserts.  There were queues for the restaurant at peak times but it's difficult to cope with 700 people all wanting eat at the same time in the break between the various activities and the evening concert but I thought the waiting time was quite reasonable.  We didn't mind sharing a table as we met some interesting people this way.  The young staff manning the pool bars spoke excellent English and very extremely friendly and efficient - a real credit to the Hotel and the image it gave of the Portuguese people.  The bar prices very reasonable considering that it's a 5 star hotel. We are already booked for Costa del Folk again next year."
Oct 2018,50,Excellent stay with top level service and spotless apartments,"Had a 4 night stay here - this really was a 5 star resort (not like others we have stayed in), from the service to the apartment from the moment we got there to the moment we left.We stayed in a 2 bed apartment. These are normally forgotten about, outdated and neglected, but that wasn't the case here. They were clean, fresh and spotless.Notified reception of a leaking shower head and loose towel rail on one of the mornings and they were rectified straight away.Great place, would definitely recommend!"
Oct 2018,50,Paul Claffey Tour,My wife and I really enjoyed our stay in Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and will definitely return again. Staff were lovely and all very helpful. One complaint is that the soft drinks and water was expensive in function room. Hotel is in a wonderful location
Oct 2018,50,Fantastic holiday,"Just to clarify, our holiday was part of the Costa del Folk festival 2018. This is where a holiday company, Enjoy Travel, runs a folk festival in the sun featuring some of the U.K.'s best folk artists. Our festival included Show of Hands and Fishermen's' Friends. Your holiday experience here might not have the same level of entertainment but the hotel features will probably be the same.First of all, super design and layout, fantastic sea views, great food, wonderful, helpful staff. Try speaking a little Portuguese and your efforts will be rewarded.I'm the difficult one being a diabetic vegetarian....however, there were clearly labelled vegetarian and vegan options most nights. Breakfast was never a problem for a vegetarian as there was always plenty of choice. Evening meals usually involved a tasty vegetarian stew or a curry. Plenty of veg to fill your plate. My holiday became complete on day three when I found the sugar free jam stand.The pool area featured heated and unheated pools. My wife assured me though that as warm as the heated pool was, the sea was actually warmer. (October). You can walk through the grounds to a wonderful, safe beach. There are two bars / cafe around the pool area. Again, lunchtime vegetarian options are available. There is another cafe/bar area at the bottom end of the hotel complex near the beach. This is called Bar Atlantica. Again, interesting vegetarian options were available. This is a stunning location. I've added it to my list of favourite places in the world to enjoy a coffee. Trust me, sitting here with a coffee, listening to and watching the waves rolling in.....wonderful.Book a room with a sea view. Apartments are also available here."
Oct 2018,40,Music week with paul claffey tours,Hotel was fab. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Pool area was lovely and was great to have the beach nearby. Breakfast was ok and buffet was very nice. Only fault was my good cardigan went missing from my room & i notified reception & also asked the cleaner but she had no english. Unfortunately it was not located.
Oct 2018,40,Mr. H.,"Have stayed here twice before, this is an excellent hotel,great hygiene, large comfortable bedrooms, friendly helpful staff.Outside pool area very pleasant, with ample sun lounge beds,beach only yards away. If you failed to enjoy a stay here the problem probably is with you."
Oct 2018,40,Lovely clean hotel,"Very clean tidy hotel, nice friendly polite staff, excellent clean and well serviced rooms, excellent buffet and food choice, private beech and plenty of facilities. My negative gripe is the seating area is limited around the bar area, if hotel is full you can struggle to get a seat. Also company conference meetings held when we were there so lots of people buzzing around."
Oct 2018,50,Great Value,We spent 9 days here in a studio and self catered and ate out so didn’t eat in the hotel.Hotel was very clean and facilities were great.Only minor gripe was rooms being cleaned in late afternoon when most people want to be able to relax or prepare for the evening .Only a minor thing though otherwise first class with excellent friendly staff
Oct 2018,40,Costa del folk,We stayed at this hotel because we were attending a folk festival. The hotel was very accommodating and we really enjoyed our stay.We stayed on after the festival for a few days and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.
Oct 2018,40,Recent visit for folk festival,"This is an excellent hotel which we have visited for the second time. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was lovely with great air con (which was needed given the heat) A great hotel for the Costa del folk festival. However, the food was a buffet service which necessitated ridiculously long queues and the food was set out in an unhelpful way, e'g the soup was in the middle of the salad and 'hot' food. The menu was pretty good but the hot food was just not hot, luke warm and sometimes inedible because of this. If they could sort these things out they would get 5 stars but....."
Oct 2018,50,Autumn Trip 2018,"We travelled to the hotel for a short mid-term break, it is a venue close to our heats as we were married there in 2010. Wonderful vista and outdoor facilities by the Mediterranean sea, beautiful backdrop for young family time out."
Oct 2018,30,2nd visit for Costa del Folk,"Apartment spacious and comfortable with good air conditioning. Cleaned efficiently every day. Pleasant surroundings close to good beach. If only the kitchen could provide hot food, it would be excellent, but is unpalatable at tepid temperatures."
Oct 2018,40,Great location and service in this 5 * hotel,"A well run 5* hotel in a great location . Everything you need in this hotel, beach front and lots of space. Staff well trained and helpful. We were at a folk festival held at the hotel. Food quality was excellent, though provided to a budget. Great breakfast available outside, a must on a warm day."
Oct 2018,40,Mostly positive comments.,Nice and polite reception workers are always happy to assist. Our apartment was not new as in the pictures but it was serviced very good by the housekeeping workers. A noise did bother us but not too much. Food is good in the hotel.
Oct 2018,50,Excellent,Excellent stay yet again our third time to stay here and we will definitely be back 😊. We even got complimentary champagne and a room upgrade for my birthday. Staff are always so helpful and the guy who checked us in was so friendly and nice! 5stars all round 🤩
Oct 2018,30,too bad,"everything was in hot plates. Nothing baked a la minute and that for 5 stars. for 5 stars do you expect a bit more, especially since the restaurant was not completely full. Because the kitchen was open to all long remained 18:00 's hour and was thus no longer so hot."
Oct 2018,40,Relax in luxury out of town,"Good 5 star with all the extras, apartments and hotel rooms. 40 minutes walk to Albufeira or free shuttle bus. Good sandy beaches. Firm beds. Not all facilities open as end of season. Good sized apartments, well equipped. Many English TV channels"
Oct 2018,50,Costa del folk,"Good comfortable hotel, good food, excellent staff. Great location fronting onto the beach. Need to be reasonably mobile because of different levels accessed by stairs although lifts available. Outside patios for alfresco eating really good with large umbrellas if needed. Great sunsets over the ocean."
Oct 2018,40,Smashing hotel,"Really good hotel with friendly and efficient staff.We visited as part of the Costa Del Folk Portugal Festival organised by Enjoy Travel (recommended) and our party more than filled the whole hotel.The hotel was very busy with such a large party but the staff coped well.Buffet breakfast and dinner was good and the hotels beach bar was excellent for lunch.The rooms were comfortable and clean and there were also available apartments which our friends told us were good also.Grounds and swimming pools excellent with one heated pool.Highly recommended, a good four star hotel."
Oct 2018,40,Folk Festival break,"I enjoyed my stay - the staff were polite and friendly. I wish I had know how long it would take to check into our apartment. We kept being told, '10 more mins' and in the end it was 4:30 before we could get in. I didn't particularly being told where to sit for meals - it seemed to cause long queues. The food was delicious but only just warm."
Oct 2018,40,Costa del folk,"This hotel is in a beautiful spot on the sea front, with a good beach and aspect. Most of the staff are very friendly and helpful and the food is of good quality. As a vegetarian, the food choices were limited and I would imagine vegans would struggle. The free red wine that came with the evening meal was copious and surprisingly good. Also, the fresh fruit was excellent. Our room was OK and in a great position but could have been a little cleaner as the curtain linings were stained and my towel had a hole. The decor is a little tired in places but the heated hydro pool, although expensive to use, is lovely. In general. I would recommend this hotel although it wasn't quite as luxurious as I would have expected from a five star place. We were there for the week long folk festival they hosted so our experience may not be typical of the hotel when that is not on, when it isn't full or it is more peak season."
Oct 2018,50,Well run hotel with a beautiful outlook,"We recently stayed here for a Costa del Folk event. Beautiful hotel with beach access, 4 swimming pools, and very professional and friendly staff who did not seem phased at all by an entire hotel full of people arriving and booking in on tge same day, for meals in a much shortened time frame due to the event timings (including  late breakfasts due to late nights). Food was buffet style but good quality,  and staff did their  utmost to work with the Enjoy travel team and it's clients.  Our  apartment was beautiful and cleaned properly every day . The only (tiny) criticism is that the hotel should note vehicle registration numbers- we had a note left on our windscreen which we did not find until we were leaving - and by then no one knew why it had been left there."
Oct 2018,50,Excellent stay for music event,"Highly recommend this hotel with superb staff.  Everything from the general areas, bedrooms and pools area is kept very clean. Bedrooms are spacious with balconies.  Good choices at the buffet breakfast and also for evening dinner.  Will be returning."
Oct 2018,50,First Class Hotel,"Reception, facilities and food were exceptional during stay with beach access direct from hotel making hotel location ideal. Stayed in apartment which was well equipped and cleaned each day. Management and staff were absolutely fabulous and nothing was to much bother."
Oct 2018,50,5 start,"Fantastic hotel. very Clean, top service. staff were professional throughout the week. the food was great. lots of choice of activities and views to die for. Great beach at the bottom for sunbathing!!"
Oct 2018,50,Great hotel,Great place to stay. Near beach and town. The apartments are comfortable and plenty of room. The staff are friendly and easy to talk to. Love the walk down to the beach from the hotel and on your way back up stop at the cafe for a refreshing drink or lunch.
Oct 2018,50,Great place for folk festival,"Overall very good service. I had a basic room.  Only thing I missed was tea making facilities, but otherwise very good and very comfortable bed.  Location a little out of town, but a courtesy bus was available, so not really an issue.  Enjoyed my stay."
Oct 2018,50,Costa Del Folk Portugal,"What an incredible week that was. Live music concerts, ceilidh dance and late night song sessions (organised by yours truly - thanks to those who attended these it made it fun to run them. We even continued them at Faro Airport departures lounge due to the 1 and 1/2 hour delay). The Aqua ceilidh was a hoot; can't wait for the videos of this."
Oct 2018,40,Lovely Hotel.,We were in the hotel for a week. It is a beautiful hotel with amazing views. Our room was amazing and had super sea views. The only disappointing thing is the food in the restaurant. It isn't up to scratch for such an otherwise outstanding 5* hotel. This is disappointing as we didn't really want to leave the hotel but had to. The menu hasn't really changed since our visit last year. Please do something about the toasters !!
Oct 2018,50,Fabulous Hotel,"We have just returned from a weeks' stay at the Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa and we will definitely be back.  The hotel was very modern and clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly, especially Fernando at Reception and Antonio in the Bar.  The rooms are very spacious and the beds are extremely comfortable."
Oct 2018,50,Paul Claffey week,"The hotel was excellent but I think you are losing out by not having an evening meal  on the menu that Irish / English people like eg steaks, roasts fish potatoe and vegetables.   A large portion of the group were eating out.   Look at the menu in ""Martins"" for example."
Oct 2018,40,Lovely stay at Grande Real,"We stayed for 10 days in September 2018. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay though we were unable to use all of the hotel facilities because we had hired bicycles for the duration of our stay. Breakfast was good, the room was comfortable, we slept well and room service meals were of good quality - we booked B&B as we preferred to check out the old town of an evening.The staff were extremely helpful and assisted us by storing the expensive bicycles we had hired safely overnight. The hotel is very close to the beach although access could be a little tricky for anyone who is not fully mobile.We look forward to returning to Albufeira and would certainly consider staying at the  Grande Real again. The regular coach service from the hotel door to the town was very useful, we just took a taxi back if it got late.Overall, a great holiday."
Oct 2018,40,Costa Del Folk again!,"Our return visit to this hotel for the folk festival has been a better experience this time around in that we didn't get ill on day 5 which I put down to the better quality of food and the hotel overcoming problems of mass catering outside We had an apartment again which was nearer to the hotel entrance and therefore noiser, but the room was pretty well insulated.In the apartment, nearly everything worked except the freezer door was broken and water from the freezer compartment filled the upper shelf, the patio doors were broken on one side and the remote for the bedroom tv didn't work - I call these 1st world problems. The water at this hotel is safe to drink from the taps and so you won't need to lug water from the mini market.on day 1.There is a spa here which we didn't use and an in door pool as well as multiple out door pools - 1 heated and the remainder ice cold.Prices here are the same as you would expect in a UK hotel with a reasonable pedigree.The hotel needs a maintenance programme during the winter months as the granite path and road is starting to break up and health and safety is not a priority here - a fall on this surface would be pretty serious for anybody of any age.The staff here are friendly and efficient at their jobs - it makes a difference to whether you enjoy staying at a hotel or not I think."
Oct 2018,20,Definitely not a five star hotel,"We stayed here in a one bedroom apartment between the 11th-20th September with a 14 month year old daughter. Our apartment was located next to the bar of the neighbouring hotel. Every night there was loud music or terrible karoke, which was a nightmare for us having such a young child who was constantly woken by it. We complained on more than one occasion but nothing was ever really done.Upon entering the apartment, we noticed a strong musty smell coming from the bedroom.After alerting the hotel to this odour, they tried to get rid of it using some kind of chemical cleaning agent that was even worse than the original smell.The apartment was spacious and clean, though the décor was a little dated. The pool behind the reception area was really nice as were the views. The hotel also had a very nice beach, which they provide towels for. The kid's club was a nice bonus. The location is good."
Oct 2018,40,holiday,the holiday was great but our experince at  faro was a disaster  you can ask any of the holliday makers so that would put me off going againyours tony breslin as for the hotel it was very nice and comfy
Oct 2018,50,Great hotel,"Our second stay with Costa del Folk. Apartment great, bed very comfortable. We had lunch at the beach cafe every day ( beach is really lovely) Staff are fantastic, really helpful and efficient. A special mention for the young woman who cleaned our apartment, she did a first class job."
Oct 2018,50,Beautiful resort hotel,"Beautiful resort hotel, friendly staff and atmosphere, very clean and modern rooms. The beach was just 5 minutes walk away and the nearby towns just 10-15 minute drive (regular free shuttle bus to old and new town) Bars, restaurants, night life, kids activities, something for everyone. We really enjoyed our stay here and will definitely visit again!"
Oct 2018,50,Family holiday,"I have stayed here 2016,2017 and 2018 and each year the hotel got better and better.Lovely upgrades done each year. The hotel is in a perfect location in the new town with shops, pubs, food places all beside the hotel. The strip is only a 5 minute walk away, the old town is 5 mins away in a taxi ( costs €5 )I will 100% be back in 2019."
Oct 2018,50,Brillant experience,"From start to finish, it was an amazing experience.  Staff so kind and so helpful throughout, a really enjoyable stay in a very relaxing environment.   The buggy back and from the apartment was a lovely experience. The hotel itself was just fabulous. Ten out of ten."
Oct 2018,40,FOOD QUALITY,After one nights eating in the restaurant the quality variety and presentation was so bad that we had to get our money back on a meal package we bought. 5 people and two trips to reception the staff were unable to do a refund via the card machine which is unbelievable! Eventually they gave me cash back. Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. Martins Restaurant the closest one was reaping the benefits as it was packed every night. Excellent shuttle bus service!
Oct 2018,40,irish country music week,"Hotel was lovely, great staff, I had a one bed apartment and it was lovely. my only complaint was the food, very poor for  5 star hotel. Cleaner was brilliant, washed my coffee cup and whisky glass every day, I could not ask for anymore"
Oct 2018,50,Beautiful location and hotel,Stayed at hotel for second time as part of a country music festival didn't think they could improve on facilities from last year but this year got a ground floor room and it was out of this world the comfort of opening the patio out onto your own green grass terrace was amazing.  Staff are always obliging local taxi firm are prompt and reasonably priced.
Oct 2018,50,Amazing,Have been coming for the last 5 years on the paul claffey trip. It is the highlight of my year coming back each year.  Love everything about the hotel . The hotel is bright and airy with brilliant views . Check in is always so smooth and organised . Reception  staff are friendly and go out of their way to make sure everything is right. Rooms are spacious and immaculate and keep really well. Love the pool area where you can chill out and have a drink without having to move whilst looking at fabulous views.  Food is top class. The staff in jiggy jig bar are so friendly and enter into the celebrations . Looking forward to next year already
Oct 2018,50,holiday in portugal,a real gem of a hotel excellent price. service great. definitely be back.room was fantastic with a real comfortable bed...food and drink prices very reasonable my only complaint if you could call it one was the swimming pool was cold but once in fine
Oct 2018,50,Excellent choice 👌,"Excellent hotel, excellent food and drink. Great place for families with kids. 4 pools to choose from. Great kids club. Easy access to the beach from the hotel. Lovely restaurant by the seaside to have a drink and watch the sunset.Highly recommended."
Oct 2018,50,Fantastic hotel ideally located to the strip and beach,Hotel done out to a good standard. Ideally located to the strip about a 10 minute walk and only a few mins to nearest bars and restaurants. Hotel very nice rooms done out to a high standard. Food on site good. Didn't have breakfast but bar snacks very good. Pool area lovely spacious and the hotel as a whole very clean
Oct 2018,50,Fantastic stay,Stayed here for WMO tournament and it was a lovely place to stay! The staff are very friendly and my room was clean and comfortable The breakfast food was amazing and a large veriaty! The beach is close by and clean! And overall experience was amazing
Oct 2018,40,Well situated,"Overall very good, a fair way to any bars. The food and drink is quite expensive. All the staff were helpful and friendly. The free bus was always on time, the only poor thing was that the last one was at 6.25. Not much of a problem as you could get a taxi from Albufeira back for about 6.5 euros ."
Oct 2018,50,Amazing place,"Yet another wonderful stay, 4th time here, this time with my 2 year old daughter. Incredible place, highly recommended. Can’t wait to get back next year. Holds a special place with my girlfriend and I, the scenery is spectacular. Little gem"
Oct 2018,50,Great vacation,We had a great time at this resort and I would highly recommend this place to my family and friends..the staff were very friendly and helpful..we enjoyed walks along the beach and sitting by your beautiful pool..loved it and would go back for sure
Oct 2018,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort,"Excellent hotel, staff were so pleasant and helpful, food was divine, courtesy air conditioned coach to take you in and out of old town, beach was brilliant, we traveled as a family of 10, everyone enjoyed especially surprise birthday treat, one complaint only, hotel taxi company leaves a lot to be desired,one particular driver was rude, insulting and well out of order"
Oct 2018,50,Girls trip away,Stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment with breakfast .Everything was top class -even the weather .Booked directly with the hotel -is a tad on the expensive side .Taxis into Albufeira old town about 8 euros .Hotel in a fantastic position right onto a beautiful beach .
Oct 2018,50,excellent hotel,A really good hotel which ticks all the boxes.Staff very friendly and very courteous. Food very good in all Restaurants.Rooms well cleaned.Air conditioning very effective.Hotel has a lovely view over the Bay
Oct 2018,50,Fabulous Hotel,Fabulous hotel fantastic location with amazing sea views. The staff were lovely. Hotel is on the outskirts of Albufera so if you want to be in the thick of things then maybe not for you. We loved it and the hotel runs a regular courtesy bus service to Albufera old town. Would highly recommend this hotel.
Sep 2018,50,Competition holiday,"We were in your hotel in portugal with the world Martialarts championships.  The venue was amazing, brilliant views, right near the beach.  Friendly staff,  very clean, great breakfast with champagne,  we will definately return"
Sep 2018,50,Amazing Hotel,Really great hotel in a beautiful location. All staff were extremely nice and helpful. Apartment was lovely and had everything we needed. Food at the hotel was good quality. Would highly recommend this hotel!
Sep 2018,50,Just returned after good holiday,"We asked for a sea view room which was quiet and were happy enough with our room. There was a noisy party one night after a wedding but to be fair it stopped at about eleven and one or two noisy guests around, but that happens everywhere and is not the hotels fault. We stayed breakfast and evening meal and while some of the food was not to our taste we always ended up having enough to eat. The breakfasts were kept hot which does not always happen at hotels abroad and there was a good choice. The rooms were perhaps a little dated but again this is not unusual and we were perfectly happy with ours and we found our bed very comfortable. Also pleased to have a sheet as well as a quilt, as most nights this was all we needed and blankets provided for if the weather was cold so all options covered. We have been cold when abroad at night, if the weather is bad. We went to a local supermarket for water etc as the hotel prices were much higher and also some days for our midday meal. We liked the setting of the hotel and would recommend it. The staff were all very nice and helpful and also seemed happy in their work. The only real fault we could find is that while the hotel is kept spotlessly clean the pool area does not seem to be cleaned much, if at all. We have seen people sweeping and even washing down these areas at four star hotels, yet there was no sign of any cleaning around the pool areas here. There were items such as ice lolly sticks lying around and we noticed them left there all the time we stayed."
Sep 2018,50,Santa Eulalia Hotel and Spa,"Changed to this Horel after reading very bad reviews of hotel already booked.  So glad we did!  Excellent location, very clean, neat and tidy.  Very comfy beds, plenty of hot water and good water pressure.  Adequate kitchenette, good  size fridge.  Small balcony but did have sea view.  Weather very hot (September) so very grateful not to be on sunny side of Hotel.  Quiet yet close enough to restaurants, The Strip, beaches, walks.  Very good transport links for those who needed it -  tuktuks, taxis, local buses, etc.  Highly recommended"
Sep 2018,40,Refurbishment needed!,"This was our 6th or 7th time staying at this hotel& for the 1st time we had small critism about it. We stayed in the apartments and find these brilliant but I think they could do with some upgrading. The decor, fabrics are there forever & this year it showed for us unfortunately. Our couches, cushions and wardrobes all had a bit of a mouldy smell ! We were really surprised at this as we have never found this before & really think this is not 5 star standard & necessary  to upgrade! Also our correct amount of bathroom towels weren't given each day & I had to ask accommodation for them. Lastly on the accommodation, the beds are really uncomfortable ! Please change them!!!The final thing is a suggestion for the hotel. I suggested it last year also but obviously wasn't looked at! A laundry room would be very handy on the premises with some washing machines. I travelled with my 2 small children & would have found one great!Overall the hotel, service , food and facilities are excellent but things started to deteriorate this year for us unfortunately."
Sep 2018,40,Very good ,"As a hotel area this place is great. Beautiful location with a range of rooms and apartments. Nice pool area or a pathway down to the beach with the usual jet ski, paddle boats, sailing etc. You also have a games room, tennis courts and gym as well as a spa.If you want to get your own food there are a couple of mini markets nearby which will give you some of the basics as well as a number of restaurants which are within a few metres to a couple of miles to the hotel which most are aimed at the tourist rather than the locals.This is a great place if money is not an issue and you don't mind staying on site or using it as a base to travel away from to visit other parts of the region.We visited for an event along with a number of friends. Although this is not my thing for a family visit as normally we look to budget to our limits and try to look at an area with more traditional local restaurants and location it is however a recommended place to try."
Sep 2018,50,Grand Real Santa Eulalia Resort and spa,We have stayed in Albufeira on several occasions and have not found accomodation to better this. This was our second stay in the Grande Real Santa Eulalia resort and spa. The staff can not do enough for you and any minor problems encountered have been rectified immediately. We have stayed in both the hotel complex and apartments and both are of a very high standard. Can not wait to return
Sep 2018,30,Ransacked & Robbed in this Supposed 5 Star Hotel ,Very disappointed in the security of this supposed 5 star hotel. We were Broken into and Robbed of our valued possessions with the Hotel accepting no responsibility for our loss other than offering drinks and a meal. At this stage we could not stomach a meal! Could not believe Police were told that there is no Video surveillance  for the area near our room which is in a secluded area. We were devistated by this event which had a huge impact on an overall trip to Spain & Portugal to celebrate my wife's coming 60th.
Sep 2018,50,Very comfortable and relaxing hotel,"I stayed here based on a recommendation and wasn't disappointed. From the arrival and check-in to the quality of the food, pool area and staff I would definitely recommend this hotel for a wide variety of people, from couples to families and solo travellers. The staff were excellent and all aspects were catered for."
Sep 2018,40,Chill Out Time,"Stayed here wk ending 23 rd sept, myself and partner.Everything in the hotel is great, just a little niggle, fried breakfast was,nt to good, bacon greasy, sausages were dry n spicy , but the rest of the buffet more than makes up for it, great choice of everything else.Also room was cleaned and no bath towels were left, so asked maid to leave some off, and she must,ve forgot, had to ring reception to get some delivered to our room. Fridge was, nt on or if it was the water was, nt cold when i took it out!1  other thing, i think the hotel settee, s in the foyer need renewing , you sit and sink into them, so time they went.Over all a lvly stay!"
Sep 2018,40,Good Stay,"Great front desk employes. Ocean view and a big room but a little bit out dated. All the staff are very kind and the main restaurant offers you a good variety of choice. Would come back again, for sure."
Sep 2018,50,Very pleased!,"Very nice service, beautiful, stylish and clean hotel. The food was good and the view was great. Also the room was fantastic and very clean. The service was also great, very kind and helpful. Well done!"
Sep 2018,30,Hotel Grande Real Santa Eulalia,"A nice hotel with lovely pools, just a shame the outlying pool bars were not open (and there was no waiter service), so there is quite a trek to the main bar.We were upgraded to a 1-bed self-catering apartment room 537 - which was lovely.  There is a nice, sunny living room/diner/kitchen; fully equipped with everything you needed including tea towels.  However the bedroom was very dark and (after a few days), started to smell of, and feel, damp.  As we were quite a few days into our 7-day break, we did not report this at the time – but thinking back, we should have.The buffet breakfasts were typical continental breakfast, with everything you expect to see – super."
Sep 2018,50,1st stay,Super hotel loved  every minute of our stay Special birthday treat from management super surprise. We would like to thank all hotel staff for a wonderful holiday We would love to return sometime in the near future
Sep 2018,30,Nice hotel but won’t be back to Albufeira,"If you find yourself in Albufeira, I’d recommend staying at the Real Grande. We had a good stay here, the facilities are good and the staff very friendly. However, we found that Albufeira, and the Algarve in general, has sold its soul to mass tourism in all the wrong ways. Drugs and drunks everywhere. The hotel is good but because of the rest of our holiday, I doubt we’ll be back."
Sep 2018,50,Simply Amazing,"I cannot fault this hotel, service was spot on, immaculate, staff could not do enough to help, pool areas amazing and never had trouble getting a sun lounger, breakfast options was great, opted to eat out in evenings but all meals we had inside the restaurant were great, very child friendly and had the most enormous kids club, loved this hotel cannot wait to get back there"
Sep 2018,50,Lovely hotel,We booked for a two week holiday but due to a bereavement in the family we had to fly home after 9 days but the time we spent in the hotel was excellent. From The reception staff to the serving staff and everyone else we were treated brilliantly. And the help we received when we explained we had to leave early was exemplary. We will be back .
Sep 2018,30,"5* Staff, 3* Hotel","Grande Real Santa Eulália Resort & Hotel Spa Albufeira 5* Staff - 3* Hotel 616475707 I must start by saying we were satying in a self catering suite so I can't comment on the main hotel rooms.Our suite was very tired, flaking walls, poor decoration, poor drainage,etc; however it was cleaned every day to a good standard, towels and bed linen changed when required.All the staff we met were brilliant. The grounds of the hotel need some t.l.c.in places and as I have said it just looks a bit run down, so only 3 stars from me."
Sep 2018,40,Very good and quiet but town a bit too far to walk to!,What let the hotel down in my opinion was that they didn't give much info about hotel restaurant locations times etc or detail of the spa and when I went down to the spa I was told it was €20 to use the indoor pool!Drinks were a bit more expensive and the nearest bar outside was 1km hilly walk although 2 nice restaurants just outside that did sell drinks/cocktails with/after meals.They supplied free transport to old town and new town (the strip!) But only every couple of hours and last one was 7:20pm! So had to get tut-tut back €10-16. The strip is noisy and over crowded - really for youngsters only although had a couple of nice cocktails there!Saying all that the room was great and we were given upgrade to a sea view which was fantastic. The hotel was quiet and no sunbed issues. The beach was not private and did get busy especially when the tide was in! Nice walk across rocks when tide in for other beaches some very quiet and secluded.
Sep 2018,30,No more than a 3.5*,"We've just returned from a family holiday to Portugal where we stayed at this hotel. We were downgraded from a resort room to an apartment room. The reason that we chose a resort room was to be closer to the facilities within the hotel. The apartment that we were allocated was the furthest away from the resort as possible. When we questioned this we were told that there were no other rooms as there was a wedding party and a large cycling group that had booked into the hotel at the same time. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and the hotel is OK. The main pools in the resort are heated but the pools closer to the apartments were freezing cold. The breakfast buffet was excellent, definitely worth having this if you want to stay here.The beach is a 10 minutes walk away but there are a number of stairs to negotiate if like us you have a baby and a pram/buggy this can be tricky.The children's play area is a nice extra benefit, we spent a little time there on our final day.There are a number of restaurants a short walk away. (Beware that the area is very hilly!). The food was very nice at these (look out for the tourist menus). There are only two restaurants in the main hotel for evening meals, one being a buffet (charging €30+ per person).  Again we were unfortunate that the other restaurant, which was advertised as a burger bar, was shut for the two occasions that we wanted to use it for the cycle group. The other three bars only served food till 5:30. We are vegetarian so food options within the hotel were very limited.We didn't really have the chance to use the spa facilities.It is definitely not deserving of a 5* rating though, 3.5* is closer to the mark. Having the option we probably wouldn't stay here again in the future, it really lacked the wow factor."
Sep 2018,40,Not as good,"Spent ten nights here from 3rd September , Hotel was spotlessly clean , staff very friendly,especially the barmen, Only grumbles were rooms not cleaned most days until after 4pm , and the food was not really up to  expectations , Very repetitive and bland stews and over cooked meat! The location was very good but there is very little to do in Albufeiria except eat and drink!! The beach is down a very steep hill and not for elderly or people with walking difficulties. The entertainment was a joke! Karaoke and a singer (same man) a definite throwback to the sixties as was he💤  Portugal seemed to be stuck in a time warp with musicians playing loudly in restaurants and very old fashioned. I don't think that we will be returning anytime soon, but if you like hot sunny lazy days then this is for you. This hotel is ideal for b&b or self catering I would not advise the half board option because of the food! it is cheaper to eat out."
Sep 2018,20,Disappointing,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel. Was a little disappointed considering all the great reviews I thought this would be a great hotel to stay at. ALOT of minor issues that ruined our experience. First off rooms are very dated, beach was dirty and over crowded. My fiancé and I had just came from a real 5* hotel in Vilamoura and we were newly engaged therefore we were celebrating. It was impossible to get a bottle opener and 2 champagne glasses for some reason. I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that we were pulling teeth to get 2 cups. We never got a straight answer as to why we couldn't get them even though I was willing to pay. We ended up going to the bar in the lobby and they told me they were not authorized to give me PLASTIC cups????? they also do not provide any ice on the floors or let alone anywhere in this hotel. Another issue was they told me they only had 1 wine bottle opener and it was in use so I was out of luck. Luckly my sister was down the street in a hostel that provided more things that this hotel didn't. We paid about $380 a night to stay here, my sister paid $100 at a hotel and had a great experience. They have a lot to work on considering these are basic items. Would not return to this hotel nor would I recommend it to anyone.**Forgot to mention our bed sheets had blood on them when we arrived."
Sep 2018,40,Enjoyable stay at this hotel,"Overall we enjoyed our stay. However I was disappointed that there was no complimentary tea/coffee/snacks in our apartment. I was very pleased with the reception staff, in particular the ladies who helped me sort out my flight issue."
Sep 2018,40,Great hotel. Lacking in the food department,"Stayed here for 5 nights from sep 9th, really enjoyed our stay, hotel was lovely and location was perfect with direct access to a lovely beach. Our only fault was the price, quality and variety of food, in particular the buffet lunch is way over priced."
Sep 2018,40,The good times of the 5* Hotel are over,"Visually everything looks OK but on closer inspection, see Headline. Restaurant achieves quality grade 3. We participated once in the evening buffet, per person 32 €, very proud price for the offered Quality"
Sep 2018,50,Great hotel😀,"We love that hotel, staff is so friendly and ready to help from the front desk throug restaurant staff and housekeeping service. Food delicious in your restaurants, good choice for breakfast. We gave average for sleeping quality only because our room(214) was just beside laundry so we could hear machines working. Thank you to all of you. We'll be back."
Sep 2018,50,Holiday,"Was great, services fantastic and we will be back. Friendly staff , very organize and clean, some days in breakfast was a bit busy but 5 mins wait and was fine. Beach is clean and good services with sunbeds and towels from the hotel prefect."
Sep 2018,50,Amazing venue for Wedding,"We had our wedding here and stayed for a week. The hotel is fantastic and staff are excellent. The day itself was perfect, from the set up, the food, the venue etc we couldn’t have wished for better. Special mention for the two wedding co-ordinaters Angela & Patricia who were so helpful from the day we first visited the hotel to view it right through until we checked out. Highly recommended hotel for a relaxing holiday or wedding abroad."
Sep 2018,40,May holiday,"We returned to this hotel in May this year and have now stayed 6 times. The hotel is lovely and staff are usually happy to please. The hotel is situated on the beach which is the perfect location. Unfortunatley in May there was a conference [ this in not unusual) but I do feel that the holidaymakers were treated appallingly; we were classed as less important and for this reason we chose to go to another location in August. It infuriated us as we have previously have had wonderful holidays here. At breakfast and other mealtimes the people attending the conference were treated  better and served prior to holidaymakers, this truly is not on when you are paying good money to stay there.( I was told by a female restaurant manager quite firmly that I would have to wait while she seated the conference attendees before I could be attended to ) It has certainly tarnished my memories of this hotel and I am not sure that we will return.The hotel is well situated near Albufeira and there is a shuttle bus provided from the hotel into the town. There are lots of bars and restaurants and you can make your holiday as busy or as relaxing as you wish. The rooms are clean and spacious.  The staff are obliging in all areas and try their best to help where they can."
Sep 2018,50,Great Resort,"only pro for all the resort, one little thing to add is regarding the breakfast variety (it is the same products in every morning).but it is not a thing to wory about because you have where to choose from."
Sep 2018,50,Family wedding ,"We attended here for a wedding , this place has the wow factor . As we didn't stay here I can't comment on the hotel that way , but from what we saw of the service from staff was impeccable.  The views from here are beautiful , with private access to the beach . It was a beautiful place to get married , from the service to the meal and evening reception , everything the hotel did was Perfect."
Sep 2018,50,Great Short Break,An excellent hotel with friendly staff and perfect location next to the beach. Free shuttle bus into town so the best of both worlds.Great Value for money for a top hotel. Nice restaurants in the hotel and nearby.
Sep 2018,50,A week in the sun,"We stayed here for a week, the weather was spot on, mid 20’s. It was our first time in this part of Portugal and the first time in this hotel. The rooms as spacious and accommodating, as is the hotel in general. There are a number of different places to eat, from beach and pool bars to cafes and restaurants. Our favourite is the fish restaurant with a sea view, in my opinion, it was the best restaurant we experienced while here, full stop. The location is perfect too, you have everything you need on site, but the new town is a 10 min walk away and the old town just a short bus transfer away. The service was excellent, with all the staff being very friendly and extremely professional at the same time. Would I recommend this place, absolutely!"
Sep 2018,40,Good location,"Nice hotel with pleasant staff, always willing to help, and good facilities. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Short distance to albufeira by foot and taxi - shuttle bus helpful too. Would recommend for families."
Sep 2018,50,Excellent!,"Perfect stay in Albufeira! We stayed for our annual Away Day in this beautiful hotel. The service was very friendly, the hotel rooms were exceptional clean and the food just great! I will definitely come back!"
Sep 2018,30,Good time by the beach!,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a work event.  The rooms are well maintained, the staff are friendly and the bar had a good selection of spirits etc.I had planned on going swimming in the pool for some exercise.  However, the pools are designed for child use only as they are circular and very shallow!The line for breakfast is crazy at points and the food at breakfast was only average."
Sep 2018,10,Rooms and beds are outdated,We got the hotel blindly on Hotwire and couldn’t believe how outdated the rooms were. Felt like a hotel in Cuba. The beds were old and the decor was terrible. We were so bummed about it that we spent the majority of our day doing activities to avoid being there. It could be a great resort if it was renovated. The staff was friendly but not enough to keep me going back on recommending. I would rather stay at a B&B
Sep 2018,50,Wedding Venue,"We were here for a wedding and it is a lovely hotel, the location of the wedding was separate from the hotel guests so no one's privacy was intruded on. A lovely hotel with friendly staff. Great setup for a wedding with nice food and facilities. This is a family-friendly hotel."
Sep 2018,50,Wow.....simply awesome,This place is surely 5 star and beyond. I was hesitant to book this hotel as some reviews said this does not deserve to be a 5 star but glad I did. This place is awesome and on the tip of the Santa Eulalia beach with beautiful views from the hotel and the restaurants. If you ask me this is even better than the other close by beaches in Albufiera. There are loads of activities and entertainment options in the resort and ideal if for a family holiday. We stayed here for 3 nights and just wish we stayed more. There is also a free shuttle to and from the old town which is definitely a plus. Would definitely return and yes 5 Stars ofcourse :)
Sep 2018,40,5 Night Stay,"Overall a good trip, employees were exceptional and very polite. Pool facilities were great, we were always able to get loungers. The variety of foods available at the pool bar was not great, only options were sandwiches, could have been better.Breakfast was awful, not much variety and the foods on offer were not of a good standard. Hotel was great only negatives were the food options!"
Sep 2018,50,Almost perfection,"Great people and service on every step, full gastronomic offer -  variety of bars and restaurants, decent breakfats, ideal for leisure and time wasting, beautifull location close to the beach, warm and cozy atmosphere. Liltle adjustments will make it place just perfect"
Sep 2018,40,Albuefera 5 night stay!,Sixth time we have visited this area and have been here before for food! This was our second visit and it was good 2 Spaghetti Bols 1 lasagne and I had Chicken Piri Piri pizza which was brilliant! Staff warm friendly and attentative reasonable price we all thoroughly enjoyed it cheers folks👍🏻
Sep 2018,50,Excellent stay!,We stayed at the hotel for 10 nights recently. The hotel is top quality - excellent staff; entertainment; food is of a high quality. Excellent spa facilities with a range of treatments. Cleanliness throughout the hotel was excellent. A real treat. We had an excellent stay and can’t wait to return.
Sep 2018,30,Beautiful resort located in s superb location but lacks essential customer service.,"I loved the architecture, the location and the beach of this resort. It's a prime location. The 'cottage/townhouse' where we stayed was nicely furnished, spacious for three adults and very clean. However, there are more negative aspects to this resort than positive. For instance, when we arrived, while staff were friendly, they lacked basic customer service skills. We were not told about activities, which restaurants are opened on which days and times, places to visit, not offered anything to drink after a long trip, etc. We had to find all that information on our own. While it's great to see young people working at the front desk, both my daughter who is 20 years old, and I found the front desk was staffed 24/7 only by young people. They were friendly and respectful but lacked the experience and the touch to handle customer service at this supposedly 5 star resort. In terms of the restaurants, they were super expensive and, again, customer service was poor. One evening we ordered a very expensive sangria which was the wrong order. We politely complained to our waitress about it but there were no apologies or an offer to replace it with the right sangria. Usually the small things are what matters the most in customer service and this was no exception during our stay at Grande Real Santa Eulalia.  The most shocking aspect of our stay was when we learnt the hotel did not provide a dish cloth/dish soap to wash our dishes at our 'cottage/townhouse.'  The stay cost me over $300 euros a night and no dish detergent?  There was no dishwasher; I didn't mind doing the dishes provided there was dish soap. We inquired about it with front desk staff but, again, there was no offer to get us some dish soap. At the end of our stay, our schedules would have allowed us to stay an extra night but it would have cost us another $300 euros plus for an additional night. With the poor customer service, and exorbitant prices, we left. Initially I picked this resort because I was also travelling with my friend, who has stayed at good resorts in Mexico and Hawaii, therefore I wanted to make sure I had picked a good resort so that she wouldn't be disappointed.  She commented several times the service couldn't compare to that of Mexican resorts. It it weren't for the beautiful beach, this would have been a really bad choice. I hope the hotel addresses these deficiencies so that it can  truly be nice place to stay and enjoy."
Sep 2018,40,"Staff brilliant, apartments need work","It was our 2nd year in this resort. Last year we stayed in the hotel and had a wonderful experience , this year we stayed in the apartments which was tired , we were plagued with a few issues in the rooms and the pool area which should not have occurred in a 5 star resort however there are some massive positives in this resort and that is the staff. Jerome the concierge is lovely and so helpful, our waiter David in the evenings was lovely as well as the lovely Silvia ( I think that was her name ) that makes the omelettes in the morning. Ines one of the managers handled a situation in a very  helpful and professional manner , however moving forward I would say to have a good experience stay in the hotel and not the apartments. In a nut shell the areas by the pools by the apartments need work as does the rooms but I do hope this resort sorts out the bits it needs too and does well as it’s got a lot of charm."
Sep 2018,50,To die for!,"There are lovely hotels there are great hotels and then there is the Grande real santa eulalia resort and hotel spa in the algarve in Portugal.Everything was perfect, the receptionists at front desk the cleaners the waiters the staff as a whole completely make your vacation a most memorable experience, along with a wonderful beach and unbelievable views , it is a resort i shall try to return too often.ps. The breakfast lunch and evening meals are of such a high standard with such a variety that you would never think of eating anywhere else.If by chance my life is cut short then i would be most happy for my ashes to be deposited in this location so that forever i may reside in utter luxury!!!!"
Sep 2018,40,More like a 4 star plus,"Great hotel but in need of updating/refurbishment.  We stayed in an apartment that had obvious signs of wear and tear over the years.  Our job needed replacing in the apartment and the decor was pretty outdated.On our first night we had some unwelcome ants as visitors 😞 whilst this wasn’t ideal and caused a major tantrum from my 7 year old who refused to sleep in the apartment, have to say the hotel were great in sorting it out as soon as we discovered the visitors and treatment was laid to stop the problem reoccurring.  We were also offered an alternative apartment that night but decided to stay where we were.  We were also visited the next day by the Real Experience manager - João Climaco who went out of his way to try and rectify the experience we had on the first night. We were offered a suite in the hotel but had to decline due to the lack of self catering facilities but were still compensated in other ways.  We accept that things go wrong on holiday it’s evitable but the biggest thing that makes a differences is how a problem is dealt with by hotel staff and I have to say the hotel dealt with it incredibly well and with great level of customer service.  We couldn’t have asked for anything more.  There are plenty of pools for both older and younger children in the resort to keep them entertained.  The only downside however with the pools near our apartment was that the bar wasn’t open and atmosphere was pretty non existent and quiet which is great if you want the piece and quiet but we wanted more of an atmosphere which you could get from the main pool area in the hotel. We were offered a nights free dinner in the buffet restaurant on one of the nights as part of our compensation but I wasn’t impressed with the food.  The variety was good but the food itself was cold and definitly not worth the €35 per person we would have been charged.Overall our stay was great despite the initial problems.  I think if the hotel upgraded its facilities and offered better food in the buffet restaurant we would visit again"
Sep 2018,30,Some observations,"1. Family room away from main hotel bit dated, various things broken (mirror), mildew odor, cobwebs by bath tub, plastic shower curtain, A/C filter needed changing - general refurb required.2. Beach not affiliated to hotel, i.e. don't expect service or a sunbed3. Several pools with good ambience 4. Service for evening buffet excellent"
Aug 2018,40,Nice hotel,"Hotel advertised with 4 restaurants, however, on our half board package we were only able to dine in the main buffet restaurant.  The vouchers were not valid at the other restaurants so do not book this for a dine around experience. Also the main bar which overlooks the beach was closed the whole time apart from 4 weddings that took place. This is wrong that hotel guests were unable to use this area. The lady playing music and singing most nights was very good.The entertainment group was on our last night in the hotel only (out of a 10 night stay) which was 3 ladies doing different dances. They were not introduced beforehand or thanked afterwards by hotel staff.  It went on whilst hotel guests were eating dinner.  They came and went without much applause or thanks.  This I thought was wrong of the hotel too.  The ladies must have wished they hadn’t bothered!  Food and variety was very good in the main buffet restaurant but it would have been nice if we could have tried the other restaurants too as part of our half board.I must mention Philipa in the restaurant and David the waiter who were both excellent."
Aug 2018,30,Could do better. ,"Had a lovely 2 weeks holiday with my husband, myself and our daughter and husband with 2 grandsons aged 12 and 15, although I couldn’t describe it as 5 Star. More3/4. Cleaning of public parts of hotel very good, rooms not so good. Long black hair left in bath several times (we are both short grey haired). Floors not washed or brushed every day, and when they were washed sometimes the water was dirtier than the floor. Also back board of side table at bed had been splashed with something before our arrival and was still there when we left 14 days later. No toilet rolls, new towels left along with old towels. Little things that showed lack of organisation in cleaning department. We have stayed in many 5star hotels and most have a housekeeper that checks the rooms after cleaning. Another moan was food. Lots of choice but not great quality, particularly when it came to meat. Most of it had been grossly over cooked rendering it really tough and tasteless. The morning bacon was so dry and brittle that you couldn’t put a fork in it because it just broke into pieces. Staff were a very mixed bunch, some very engaging and some downright surly. Waiters in the upstairs bar very nice, good memories. Staff in the restaurant should clear plates as you leave the table to get the next course, instead they are hovering and the plate is lifted from in front of you as you put the last mouthful in and are still chewing. Most disconcerting. However the two really bright spots are the location, (which is beautiful) and the restaurant not included in the half board tariff, the Santa Eulália restaurant. This was absolutely amazing as was the food and the staff. Would give this 6 stars. In all the potential is there, it needs the management to lead from the front as it does in most successful establishments"
Aug 2018,40,beautiful location,"beautiful location beside the beach , lovely apartments with their own pools; also the pools at the hotel along with bars and restaurants were great ;free buses to/from Albufeira were very convenient.just make sure not to get apartment too far from facilities / too close to road - minor issue only."
Aug 2018,50,Pleasant stay,A very nice 4 nights stay with my 3 year old.Some of the outside public areas are a bit shabby and need some tlc but all good otherwise!Santa Eulalia restaurant is excellent but wish it was open every night.Will be back again!
Aug 2018,50,Great 8 night stay,"Just returned from an 8 night stay with my partner and 6 year old child.Really laid back atmosphere, lovely hotel and facilities, 2minute walk down to beach, shuttle bus to Albufeira new and old town, public bus stop just outside both ways to get to surrounding areas, Vilamoura ect. Very chilled laid back approach throughout, would recommend"
Aug 2018,40,Good experience,"Had a 10 night stay, on a bed/breakfast basis in an apartment. The apartment was cleaned daily to a high standard, but were some signs of ageing fabrics & a slight musty smell in  the wardrobes. The breakfast was excellent with good variety, some of the other eating places were expensive. The pool areas had plenty of loungers. The staff were mainly very helpful & polite. Over all a lovely place to stay & would not hesitate to return."
Aug 2018,50,One week in sunny Portugal!,"I stayed with my teenage sons at this beautiful resort. I opted for a self-catering flat this time. We had a marvelous time and this resort is highly recommendable. All staff are most helpful, the rooms are lovely and clean and there is nothing negative really to comment on. Would happily go here again. The beach is very close and ideal for teenagers as watersports are on the offer. My boys go diving, and it was easy to get to the local Indigo diving school by taxi. Brilliant diving school too! Plenty of activities around so a good place for teenagers."
Aug 2018,50,Short break,Lovely 5x hotel all.well equipped for self catering loved deck chairs in the garden and lovely food cleaned every day will defo visit again thanks for making are.break a happy1 plenty of lifts to get to it floodplain.was.lovely and kept well.clean even for this time of year the shops where fine and close by restaurants food was lovelywwhad about 15 minuet walk to the main stretch and the beach but it was a nice stroll and I would not recommend staying.to.close to the bars and clubs as very noisy thanks Linda
Aug 2018,30,Luxury price but no al la carte restuarants open,"We stayed here from 11th June 2018 for two weeks on a half board basis. The hotel was sold to us as a luxury 5 star plus beach and spa resort.  We are a couple in our early 50's and were hoping to have a chilled holiday utilising the spa and treatments and having a lovely al la carte meal in the evenings with some entertainment at the hotel bar area.Unfortunately there were a number of services closed while we were staying here. This only came to light on our return home and I had a look at the reviews on here.  We were never informed by the travel agent, Jet2 or the hotel staff on check-in that the al la carte restaurants were closed.  If we had been notified we would not have booked half board as two weeks of buffet style food is not what we would have chosen.We found that the two main pools were full of young children with inflatables which is fine but awkward for anyone wanting to swim as they are round swimming pools.  There were no adults only pools or quiet areas for sunbathing and reading.  We noticed that if you didn't get down early then you didn't have a sunbed and as a result there were a number of people, some with  young children, having to put towels on the grass area - this is not what you'd expect with 5 star luxury. Again, we found on returning home that it was probably due to some pool areas in the self catering sections having no poolside bars open.  The Jet2 website states ""please note: pools, restaurants and bars are open subject to occupancy and seasonal demand."" This was not pointed out to us on booking and as a customer how would we know if the hotel is not at full occupancy?  I also wouldn't class June as out of season either.The hotel was very clean although slightly dated and the staff were lovely which has made me rate the hotel slightly higher.  My husband and I used the gym/fitness room every day and attended a couple of classes; StretchFit and Pilates.  The man who took the class was amazing and if you're into your fitness, definitely give this a go.  I had a rejuvenating/anti-aging facial which was lovely and relaxing. This cost €110 and lasted 80 minutes, expensive but I had planned to treat myself before the holiday.  I would have had more but was disappointed by not being able to relax after the treatment around the pool area.The hotel offers a free shuttle service into the old town which we did 3 times. This was our preferred place to stay actually but the travel agent didn't make this clear (not the hotel's problem though).  The shuttle bus while we stayed there ran at 10:25, 11:25, 13:25, 16:25 and 18:25.  The return from the old town was 10:10, 11:10, 13:10, 16:10 and 18:10.  Personally we would have preferred a later return and eaten in the old town but you could use taxis.  There was only a couple of places to eat close to the hotel which we didn't fancy, pizza place and an Italian, I think?We walked a few times into the new town which took approximately 20 minutes which was ok for an ice cream stop or a quick lunch and is lively at night (I stayed here in my 30's but it's not for me now!)The Atlantico Restaurant Bar near the beach is lovely.  Some nice, light choices for lunch and a great selection of ice creams.  The service is pretty quick too and it was busy.  I think overall the food and drink prices were quite reasonable in the hotel, cappuccinos and lattes were €2/€3, smoothies €4, tortilla wraps €5, water 1.5l €3.  We spent 2 days on the beach and this was absolutely lovely.  It cost €5 for 2 sunbeds and a brolly for the day and was definitely worth it. It was very peaceful and I wished we had done this more.I think the hotel closing al la carte restaurants, pool area bars and limited entertainment in the evening was short-sighted as we ended up not spending as much as we didn't bother with further spa treatments or stay in the bar area in the evening (we came home with €800 which will go nicely to next years holiday)."
Aug 2018,30,Excellent hotel needs refurbishment,We stayed at this hotel nine years ago and we do not think much had been done in terms of redecoration or refurbishment in that time. Everything worked and the food was average to good but the bedroom furniture and bathrooms were very tired.
Aug 2018,40,Enjoyable but not 5*,This was actually my 10th stay at this hotel and after not visiting for 3 years we noticed the difference in standards. Whilst the hotel is still good and we enjoyed our stay it does not warrant its 5* rating. I noticed they have made many changes in the restaurant including tea/coffee machines for self service including plastic spoons..... exactly the same food choices each day and chaotic queuing and self service. The last time we stayed here in 2015 the food was of a much better quality with more variety and the tea and coffee were ordered and brought to the table. Guests wandering round with hot drinks in a busy dining room is an accident waiting to happen!The resort apartments have not changed still clean and functional and ideal for families. I don’t like the rationing of pool towels though and if you are staying in an apartment it’s a drag having to change them each day in reception. The pool areas look tired and a lot of decking needs replacing. The pool bar was closed although we were told the hotel was 90% occupied. Obviously all cost cutting measures but not acceptable for a 5* hotel in my opinion.Would I stay again? Maybe but at nearly €300 per night I would perhaps look at somewhere a bit more up to date. It’s a shame as in its day you could not beat ths lovely hotel.
Aug 2018,20,My Stay,"not a value for money hotel, rooms needs renovation. hot breakfast was not good, made earlier. vegetarian options are limited. front desk people were not kind. even for the payment they did not have equipment which they could use to pre-authorise, I was told they need to write the credit card details on the paper which was not safe. anyways...not a value for money. for kids they have good activities."
Aug 2018,50,Great hotel,"The hotel was immaculately clean and the staff were very friendly.The breakfast was very good although busy. There were some queues if you arrived after 09:30.Lots of activities for the children.A fantastic beach with a great jet ski, paddle board, para sail activities.A cab ride into Albufeira was 6 euros and the hotel provides a free bus.The burger restaurant was excellent and I recommend the cod burger!"
Aug 2018,10,"Interesting localization but old rooms with bad service; very good fish restaurant, the buffet absolutely to avoid","Except the localization and fish restaurant, this hotel was one of my bad hotels experience, old rooms equipment, luck of staff training, buffet with long queue and limited offer which is the same everyday"
Aug 2018,50,Very nice hotel,beautiful grounds. great location and had a great time.I travelled back in Dec 2017. We had just come back from Asia were we probably were constantly travelling and just wanted a few days to chill. We got a bargin as it was off season. but personally it was just to relax. its true the pubs and bars were mainly closed. but this did not bother us as its not something that interested us. we actually preferred it. we got some good weather.the hotel staff were nice and pleasant and helped us when needed.
Aug 2018,50,Family holiday,Just coming to the end of a relaxing family holiday. Stayed in an apartment and did bed and breakfast which suited us fine. May try hotel next time. Staff very helpful at all times. Children enjoyed the kids club - took advantage of swimming lessons our 5year old had a great time and did well- cost 5euros ( money well spent) thanks Antonio. Beautiful resort in a lovey setting.
Aug 2018,50,Perfect short break,I booked this for a short break for myself and partner. The hotel was fabulous. The staff were wonderful and the quality of food and drink was great. The room we stayed in was beautiful and had the most gorgeous view of the ocean. They provide a shuttle bus that takes you into the new and old town regularly throughout the day. Perfect stay in a lovely hotel. I’ll be returning without a doubt
Aug 2018,40,Family stay over August,"Was a nice place, we went there to relax really and mainly spent time in pools and around. The beach is 5 min walk down, nice sandy beach. The water is somewhat cold though, so with kids hotel pools are a better option. Food was nice, although our 2 year old had a hard time finding anything for her liking. Main restaurant is pricy if you dont reserve your stay with meals includes. The main downside is there are no reataurnts in the hotel vicinity that serve lunch, they all start mainly after 3pm. We have reserved half board with intention of exploring areas during the day - didn’t know places would be closed. Overall had a good time with the family."
Aug 2018,50,Two week stay at Grande Real Santa Eulalia resort and hotel spa,"A fabulous luxurious and relaxing stay at a fantastic hotel. We felt very well  looked after by the friendly and helpful staff; nothing was a trouble. The accommodation was first rate; the food first class, varied and catered for everyone. We would highly recommend staying here. We will be back!"
Aug 2018,30,Cockroach in room,Found cockroaches in room and staff seemed to not care...Came a few years ago and was perfect but now they have dropped standards Also they dont give rooms until 3pm so we got there in the morning through jet2 and had to wait hrs til we got a room
Aug 2018,40,Almost 5 stars,Hotel is beautiful as is the location. Although I do think it's more 4 than 5 stars. Services are excellent. We attended a wedding and it was just fabulous. Hotel is so nice the little touches of nightly turn down service are what keep this hotel at its 5 Star rating along with spa and location. We were just a little disappointed by the ant situation :( I understand it's not always easy to keep places like this ant free but our room was quite bad. That was my only fault.Rooms are comfortable and beds are super comfy I would still recommend this hotel. Food and drinks were great too. Beach front restaurant is lovely although waiter a little in friendly:/ Otherwise it's a fab spot.
Aug 2018,20,"So disappointed, Not a 5 star, Horrible air conditioning","This is my first bad review. We are frequent travelers and have stayed at many, many resorts. My family and I stayed recently at the Grande Real Santa in rooms 27 and 28.  Although there were many things we liked and enjoyed at the resort, we had a large problem with the air conditioning in the rooms.  The weather in Albufeira was hot, but not oppressive during those days at 33-34 degrees.   However, we immediately knew the air conditioning was not cooling the rooms well at all.   We contacted the front staff 4 times during the vacation, and each time a maintenance team came to the room and stated everything was working normally and the air temperature would not get any lower. One person said ""it's because it's hot outside"" which is a strange response because I would only need to use the air conditioning if it was hot.  No one from the front desk or management contacted us to see if we were satisfied or if we would want to switch rooms.  We kept the curtains closed constantly and the temperature of the thermostat at 15-16 degrees, but the air coming into the room was barely cool.  I doubt the room temperature was less than 27 degrees at night, and sleeping for us and our two children was very uncomfortable. A 5 star hotel on a beach which is frequently busy during the hottest months of the year, it was very disappointing to have experienced the conditions in the room, and the lack of responsibility and caring by the maintenance team and the management. I would never stay here again!"
Aug 2018,50,Weekend Break with Friends,"We had a lovely, relaxing stay at this resort for 3 nights. Our friends stayed in the hotel with a sea view room which was lovely, all very clean. Tea/coffee facilities in rooms would of been a nice touch considering the price of the rooms. Myself and my two teenage daughters were allocated an apartment, these were not as nice as the rooms in the main hotel, beds hard and noise of young children in next door apartments could be heard.! Very clean and tidy though, good service. I would recommend this resort if your staying in hotel. Beautiful beach, facilities and fantastic food."
Aug 2018,50,Beautiful Resort,We have stayed at this hotel for the past 2 years and hope to stay again next year. The staff are very friendly and very accommodating. The staff at the beach resturant are not so friendly unfortunately in particular the head waiter..... The staff at the garden pool bar could teach him how to behave. The very spacious apartments are spotless and looked after by a cleaning team who are friendly and efficient.
Aug 2018,50,Excellent resort at very good location,"An excellent resort with lots of restaurants. The sea view cafe was excellent with great choices and decent price. With the beach next door, it was awesome. Quite a lot of pools for freshening up in fresh water after the sea beach trip. Kids club with decent set of activities and very polite staff. The shuttle service to Albufiera town is a bonus. Overall a nice stay."
Aug 2018,20,5 Stars where did that come from ?,"I do not agree this hotel is worthy of its 5 star status or indeed the tripadvisor rating it has.  We have stayed at better 3 star and much better 4 star hotels in the past. Our studio apartment although large and functional was certainly not luxury. The meals during our one week HB stay were poor with little choice and very bland  This was reflected by the low number of guests who dined each evening. Parts of the hotel grounds were untidy, with peeling paint and loose and broken paving. The large skip full of old bedding and bin bags that lay near the front entrance to the hotel for the duration of our stay sums up the true quality of this hotel.  During my stay I filled in a formal complaint form with the Jet2 rep. who passed it on to the hotel management.  My delay in submitting this review was caused by a prolonged correspondence with Jet2 Holidays."
Aug 2018,40,very relaxing hotel,"Very helpful staff, they cannot do enough for you.Rooms are traditional, very clean and all are close to one of the pools. We didn't have a see view but it was a nice quite resort for us and the kids loved it.*****"
Aug 2018,50,Return visit,"We love this hotel!! We stayed last year and decided to return. The location is great and the kids love the kids club. The food is good and the staff friendly and helpful.The only thing missing is evening entertainment. There is a disco in a lovely area of the hotel one night a week but it’s only on till 9pm so by the time you have have dinner you have missed it. There are sometimes singers on in the background but a show or something would be better. Also a kids disco would be great!We will probably return next year, we met several families who also returned year after year!"
Aug 2018,50,Lovely hotel ,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 days in a self catering apartment. The apartment had everything we needed for the duration of our stay, was very clean and well kept. We were greeted by Jerome on arrival and can say that we couldn’t have asked for a warmer welcome. He was so informative and made us feel relaxed. The hotel itself is lovely and has the most beautiful scenery. We stayed around our apartment pool most of the time but the main hotel pool areas were great with plenty of sun loungers to choose from. Not a lot of night time entertainment but a free bus will take you to either the old or new towns in Albufeira where there are plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. Overall a great stay in a beautiful location."
Aug 2018,10,Spa ,"My review is based on the Spa.We got married in the hotel 4 years ago and returned to celebrate with our 3 year old son  for 4 days. My parents arrived and staying elsewhere for the rest of our holiday my mother and I returned to the Spa for a treat, it was anything but! We booked in pedicures as I'm 3 months pregnant and wasn't sure regarding safety of oils used etc. My mother's pedi was booked for 2pm an hour before mine so I asked could I use the relaxation room the lady said ""It's very dark in there and will be too long, head upstairs"" so with 15 minutes until her treatment we sat by the pool which was very hot and uncomfortable no towels offered for beds even. At 2pm my mam headed for her treatment and I was shown to the relaxation room which was basic to say the least. When i was called for mine the lady wasn't very friendly and I presumed her English wasn't great and that was why  she wasn't acknowledging anything I said. When we got to the room my mother was sitting letting her nails dry and I got onto the bed (no pedicure chairs, a basin is used to wet feet really uncomfortable) when the lady doing my nails discovered I was wearing shellac she was very annoyed. Kept saying I should have told them that as to remove the shellac it was nessesery to book a different treatment (60 mins was not long enough apparently) I said I would be happy to leave and rebook for another day and that i didn't realise removing shellac was such an issue and she proceeded to use a file to remove it which to be honest I thought was disgraceful as it would only weaken my nails.. the whole time she was visibly annoyed and stressed so much so I had to ask her to stop being so rough as the pedicure was so painful. I apologised several times for the mix up and she wasn't happy to let me leave but also decided to be mean and unnecessarily rough as she was ""short for time"". I offered to pay more she told me it would be an extra €5. I have NEVER been treated so badly or made to feel so uncomfortable in any spa never mind the several 5star ones I have had treatments in before. And then the worst part.. huge cockroaches started to jump out of towels in room and scurry around me... I saw 4 god knows how many I didn't see. At that point I thought I was going to cry. She left the room. Returned told me they fumigated the day before and she was sorry about it. I'm not even sure it's safe to be in a room that's been fumigated a day later. She finished the treatment I only had €10 I didn't care to wait for my change and i left. I'm disgusted that I spent €65 to be treated so badly regardless of the fact that the Spa was infested with cockroaches. No I understand why she was reluctant to let us use the facilities. Absolutely shocking!!!! Do not book in here and waste your money."
Aug 2018,50,What a difference a * makes,"First of all I need to clarify that I haven't actually stayed here, I have simply used the hotel facilities. I am currently a guest at the sister hotel 4* Real Bella Vista. Being extremely unhappy at my hotel (see my review for details) I opted to take the hotel bus to try this one out instead. Wow, what a difference that extra star makes, the pool area here is beautiful, clean & spacious overlooking the sea. There is a lovely relaxing atmosphere about the place. The hotel cafe served us a lovely brunch at a reasonable price. The pool bar is well stocked & although a bit pricey at €10.50 for 3 cans of coke I would happily pay it over & over. The view from the pool area across to the sea is sensational & access to the beach is excellent. I only wish I could rewind time & book my family into this hotel instead. I was sad to get the bus back to my hotel!!"
Aug 2018,40,Algarve 2018,"Location nice and not in the middle of the party zone of albufeira . Room was clean just a little old from the interior. Breakfast is okay and the Buffet is quite big but more for english people... We tried one night the Restaurant at the beach which is not open every night, Service was busy mostly but the Restaurant was not even full... We Had a bottle of wine but the waiter didnt know from which region in Portugal it was and we Had to service the bottle by ourself.... I Had the fishsoup with seafruits and Filets of fish but couldnt find any seafruits i told it to the waiter but he didnt Care ,for main i tried the vealsteak which was to dry and Well done for me because nobody asked me how i like it .... We where never asked if everything is okay maybe they dont care much about tourists... What a shame im really sorry for this review, people should know you will not get treated Well for those prices you Take, there far more better and cheaper Restaurants nearby where this never happend to us."
Aug 2018,20,Very disappointing ,"This is never ever a 5* hotel! People rating this hotel with 5* have very very low expectations and probably never stayed in a 5* before. I am writing this review at 1 am, neighboors are fighting since one hour. To us it seems like there are absolutely no walls. You can hear everything, from toilet flushs to tv sound! Terrible!Bathrooms probably never have been renovated since 30 years. Not even the toilet brush is intact.Pool infrastructure is a joke for an hotel of this size. If you are looking for a place where you can chill next to the pool, don’t come here.Food is very standart - the breakfast buffet is so crowded with people that you have to stay in line to get a table. Lines at the buffet are even longer. Everything costs - the hotel is already really expensive considering what you get. Extra costs for everything, from table tennis to fresh water... very disapointing.Everything is very old - there isn’t probably one single m2 of carpet in front of our room which does not have hundreds of spots of food rests. Staff is friendly and eveything is clean.We are staying in this hotel because we were invited at a wedding and wanted to add one week of holidays. The wedding was magically! Everything was beautiful an perfect. But to spend your holidays I strongly recommend you to stay somewhere else. This is a waste of time."
Aug 2018,50,Perfect Hotel - Could not ask for better,"Absolutely stunning hotel and resort, made to feel extremely welcome, the staff in all areas of the hotel and restaurants very polite and courteous.  The swimming pool areas are lovely, the beach is exceptional, the rooms clean and spacious - no complaints whatsoever."
Aug 2018,50,Anniversary,"After reading  various reviews I was not disappointed On arrival we were most impressed by the grand entrance to the hotel, the friendly smiling faces that greeted us after a tirering flight. Prior to arrival of the holiday I emailed the hotel to arrange a little surprise to be in our room on arrival as it was our anniversary,  ( a bottle of bubbly) as a surprise for my husband. The manager insisted that this would be compliments of the hotel which was amazing. On our arrival we were given the details of our room ( I couldn't wait to see my husband's face as we entered.. with bubbles on ice)Sadly this didn't happen..I did have to phone reception to remind  the staff to bring it  to our room. ( this does not in any way detract from this amazing hotel.) my husband did wonder why I was I  the phone when he came out of the bathroomHowever.. when it did arrive..I was pleasantly surprised... Not only was there bubbly but fruit, chocolate for dipping... little cakes.. it was wonderful... whilst overlooking the sea..very romantic (husband was blown away) Thank you !!We only booked B&B but really wished we did half board.. food has been a little expensive, the food here is fantastic I cannot fault it.. but if I am being really picky...I missed not having Bananas with my pancakes. We have eaten in the hotels various restaurants and have NOT been disappointed by the cleanliness, quality and service.. again well doneWe only have a few days left of our time here and wish it was longer.. normally I cannot wait to get home.. but we have been so relaxed, calm and contented.We're already planning our next time here and will bring the grandchildren our daughter will love it. I will be sorry to leave, but thankful that I found you ""Grande Real Santa Eulalia""Until next time....xKathleen"
Aug 2018,50,Family Holiday,"What an absolutely brilliant holiday we have had at this wonderful resort. The room was spacious and comfortable, the food was amazing with so much choice, the pools were fantastic and the close proximity  to the beach made for an excellent all round trip. The staff here are also fantastic- friendly, attentive and always smiling. Thank you all. We will be back!"
Aug 2018,20,I survived the Algarve - May try Alcatraz next,"This is a marmite hotel.The rooms are quite good, we had self catering with a large bedroom, and a large sitting room, with powerful air conditioning. There are shortfalls though, as the only provision was a single bottle of water, with no useful kitchen essentials (kitchen roll, washing up, salt and pepper etc.). The pots (as always) were huge, but no way of frying an egg!The staff are exceptionally helpful, but share the need for exaggerated ""Team America"" Arm waving to realise with most of the local staff to this area.Where things start to go wrong is when you try the food within the various eating areas. Our first experience was an almost 100% wrong order from the Pool bar, with one of the least appetising Ham and cheese rolls since British Rail stopped selling their week old options in the seventies. This was compounded by the other ""snack"" bar, which serves food equivalent to a Blackpool Truckers Cafe.Unfortunately this partially extends to the main bar as well, who have a very limited, and very rigid ""menu"" for drinks, and are not flexible when asked to go ""off piste"" and provide a drink without their enforced mixer, or with no ice.We can't really comment about the other restaurants (there appeared to be two open during our visit), as they seemed to be largely under-used, and hence appeared to be concentrating more on the fully inclusive customer.The real issue though is that there is very little to do in the baking heat, without getting a taxi - the free bus being of limited value as it only stops in two locations neither of which were directly of interest to us. The Taxis were able to get much closer to the action, and hence represent better value for money if you don't want to walk around for a good 1/4 hour to get to civilisation.As to eating places around the Hotel, there are effectively four:-The Italian (Portobello) by the top of the road - Cheap and cheerful with reasonable Pizza and House Wine, but poor pastaThe Fish Restaurant (Pecurina) at the seas edge - Nice food, but seemed to make a lot of bill mistakes (both our bills had major overcharging)The Grill house (RM Martins) to the left of Main Gates - Best food, good wine, and mid value - well worth a visit.The Dutch One (Holland EetHouse) to the right and up a most un-inspiring street beside the travel office - Good homely food of Germanic Operation - but excellent service, and a real instant relaxed atmsophere - and the kids can splash in the pool as the adults enjoy the company.Shopping is also a little sparse in the area, but it seems best to turn right from the gate.Almost opposite the top corner of the site, the shop is full of cheap product, hone baked items, and local produce.A little further up the hill, there is a larger shop which has a bigger selection of familiar foods, but a little more expensive.At the top of the hill is a well equipped Pharmacy, beside the most comprehensive shop - but by far the dearest.So I am afraid Self Catering really requires a car, or a lot of use of Taxis, but getting breakfast and snacks is relatively easy.One final point is that all the taxis booked by reception were driven by helpful and chatty drivers, that could be relied upon to give better local advise on where to go than the holiday reps! On that subject, be aware that the Algarve Experience tours all seem to share a dismal record - the one we went on involved 6 hours sitting on a bus, with approx 10 minutes of ""guiding"", with only a 1/2 hour wine tasting, and 2 hour lunch break (in Lagos) relieving the boredom.Sorry, but I know that we are not unique in our wishes, and also knowing that for an all inclusive family break with 2-15 year olds, this could be an almost perfect hotel (it has a variety of pools, games rooms, light evening entertainment and other facilities - nearly all of which appear under used).I suppose visiting during the hotest period for a century may have also coloured our views a little :-)"
Aug 2018,40,Great hotel and apartments ,"Stayed here July/Aug 19 in 1 bedroom apartment bed and breakfast. Apartments dated but very clean the whole complex very clean. Staff all very pleasant especially cleaners and waiters in the fish restaurant we loved it there. Breakfast was of high standard. Albufeira Old Town was a little disappointing as still a lot of English/ German bars offering full English cocktails with football on , walk up from the main drag to find more local tapas etc. Only down side we found was the apartments were very noisy this was due to other guests not the actual resort, think we were quite unlucky with our neighbours so we were tired a lot of the time. The pools and the sea were very cold surprisingly at this time of year.Would stay at this hotel again though as more positives than negatives. My 8 year old son loved the mini football pitch and kids club ( PlayStation). Obrigado Grande Real Santa Eulalia 😘"
Aug 2018,40,Fabulous hotel,"Lovely hotel and amazing staff, the location is superb, the view from a sea view room amazing. The breakfasts are perfect everything you could wish for and so fresh. The rooms are lovely but a little shabby and dated. The poolside area is wonderful although we were slightly out of season, very relaxing and we have booked again!! Great restaurants in walking distance too."
Aug 2018,50,Ignore the bad reviews!,"Back from an eight night stay. Ryan air — all fine. Greenbus transfer — avoid at all costs.The hotel is excellent. Breakfast is well worth the money, the family apartments are excellent if oddly coloured. We overlooked the pool, which we could always get a space at — infant at times (peak times) we had it to ourselves.Dinner can be great. It's expensive. Brazilian night was 5*, Italian probably 3*. Each night is themed by country, so just check first.Staff will do anything to help, really excellent and attentive. It's a large complex but for the max walk is 3-4 min. For this who can't be bothered, reception will collect you in a golf buggy. The cleaners are great and spend a long time preparing each apartment every day, if you want them to.Don't bother with the open top bus tour, terrible. Old town lacks the culture of other old towns. Albufeira at large is a bit of a mess, especially as you approach The Strip. The best pastry shop I have ever visited is in Albufeira, near Mcdonalds / KFC / Buger King and the watch roundabout — ask when there...Eat it all.We're considering booking again next year, and that's from a non-beach-holiday family with two young sons (7 & 9) who were in their element and were sad to leave having made lots of friends. Albufeira beach is great, as is the old town beach and many others...Lots to choose from, but the hotel and the pool is hard to leave because it's all so relaxing. Portabello's opposite is great for a reasonably priced fresh pizza / pasta / family run place."
Aug 2018,50,Wonderful winter holidays!,"Great resort in Santa Eulalia, near the beach, with all the services you need to spend a fabulous time, whether during the winter or the summer. It is impossible not to leave a note of appreciation to the employees, always so kind and professional."
Jul 2018,50,Our Dream Wedding! Special thanks to Angela!,"I am writing to thank sincerely Angela and all the staff at GRSE for the huge effort they made in making our wedding such a wonderful experience for ourselves and our guests. Anglea in GRSE together with our amazing wedding planners Dave and Steffi exceeded all our expectations and went above and beyond the call of duty. The atmosphere within the hotel, the manners and work rate of the staff and the quality of the food in GRSE ensured our wedding day passed without a hitch. Angela worked so hard to accommodate food preferences and needless to say the setting blew our guests away. Thank you so much to all the staff at GRSE and congratulations to any couple planning their wedding there!!UnaMarried 8/7/18"
Jul 2018,20,Not 5 star!,"I stayed here for a wedding im July. The room we were put in was very far but hard to walk on due to the ground which needs improvement. Our stay here was spoiled on the first night when our card for room would not work leaving us locked out in the cold for an hour. We called multiple times and after 20 minutes a card was dropped up but the guy drove off before it was checked. It did not work. I then had to trek to reception to get fixed. Guy on reception didnt really care, had no explanation and couldnt say when it would be fixed. After an hour it was fixed. I told the manager the next day but there was only a token apology given and they will look in to it. Nothing was done to make my stay any better. Its really not 5 five star in terms of food, drink, decor, service. Disappointing considering the price"
Jul 2018,20,Visited the terrace restaurant,Had booked via email for a treat meal for 3 girlfriends. They didn’t have our booking when we got there but tables were available. Instead of just seating us we were made to wait for about 10 minutes whilst the waiters ignored us until we asked again. We were then seated.Had an OK but far from outstanding meal. Starters were good but main courses must have been left out for a while before serving as they were cold. Compared to other places we ate on our trip it was over priced for what we got.Service was slow. We did mention the cold meals but were exhausted from the slow service and arrival so didn’t pursue this point.
Jul 2018,50,Worth every cent.,"An hotel  visit in different times os the year, particularly early winter and summer. A wonderful place to rest en enjoy Nature. Was there first 3 weeks of July and even a maximum occupation it was not crowded. Two smiling pools, several beaches near by. Great rooms. Excellent service as usual."
Jul 2018,50,"Exceptional hotel, highly recommend","Spent 5 days last week at Santa Eulalia and had the most incredible stay. The staff were very attentive, hotel was incredibly clean and well maintained. Having a beach literally minutes away was just an added bonus. Would absolutely recommend without question."
Jul 2018,50,"Great service, lovely hotel","I went here with my son for a few days and it was great. Service is amazing, they cab arrange anything you’d wish. As soon as you arrive, staff help you with your bagage etc which is perfect when travelling alone with a child. Pools were great fun, but we also ventured out to a beach a bit further away from Albufeira and also spent a day at Zoomarine which was brilliant. We had such a lovely time here!"
Jul 2018,50,Recommend this hotel,We stayed at this hotel for one week in June as a family. It is situated by the beach with excellent facilities. The rooms were spacious with great views. Breakfasts were from a large selection. I would definitely return to stay here.
Jul 2018,40,Family Wedding/Holiday,From the moment of arrival we were greeted by lovely reception staff & if we needed anything on our stay staff were only to happy to oblige. Sandra the Wedding Planner was amazing & a big thank you for making my sisters day so special. The hotel is very clean and has beautiful views. The beach is about a 5 min walk from the hotel. Rooms are a little dated but spacious and kept clean by the lovely housekeeping staff. There is a free shuttle bus that runs to the old town & new town which is handy. The kids loved the pool but at night they were lacking entertainment for them which was a little bit disappointing. There wasn't much entertainment at night and not sure if this was due to us visiting out of high season. I would definitely stay here again!
Jul 2018,50,Comfortable Family Resort,"This is a Resort connected to the beach with many facilities specially for family with Kids.You have the option of  Apartment or Hotel room. Our One bedroom Apartment was very suitable for family with 2 Kids located directly on the Pool.Furniture old but not Bad, Housekeeping take care from everything on daily basis.They have kids Club open daily with a lot of supervision that you can keep your kids with been afraid and this gave us a relax vacation and from other side Kids Enjoy the friendship of the staff.You feel that the stuff all need you to be relax and happy during your stay , this is a good management.negative points that the restaurant limited the lunch and dinner to open buffet that didn't gave a flexibility for us and we were obliged daily to take our meals outside.They keep the snack option that we cannot repeat it  on daily basis.For bus to Old Town its a very good facility but having last turn at 6:15 PM ( where peoples just need to move to the Town) don't open the possibility to use it when going back to resort,having Bus till 10:00 PM will be a good change."
Jul 2018,50,Great Place to Stay with Kids,"We spent 8 nights here in early June and were traveling with our 6 month old son. This hotel is a fantastic place to spend with young kids. We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom apartment which we really appreciated. While the apartment itself was a little dated, it was clean and very spacious. The lobby and common areas of the hotel itself are beautiful and we really enjoyed sitting on the terrace and having a drink from the bar!  The hotel is right on the beach which is so convenient. The beach itself was quite nice and not overcrowded (I suppose that would depend on the time of year!!). We also spent time in the pool area. There were multiple pools which made it good for us as we could take our little guy into the smaller pools away from the older kids and adults. There was a kids club as well. Our son was too young to go but the other kids seemed to enjoy it. We did not eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the food. There are restaurants walking distance away but if you want more authentic fare like we did we just jumped in a taxi. 8 euros will get you into the old town. Lastly, a very special thank you to Ines, the service manager. On our first day, our son cut his foot. She personally made sure he was taken care of which put our minds at ease knowing that the hotel was there if needed.   We give our experience a 5 star rating because it was the perfect place for us to stay with our little guy.   We enjoyed our stay and will definitely return on our next trip."
Jul 2018,50,"Lovely resort, friendly people","Stayed here for 6 nights.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  Resort clean, rooms very comfortable. Would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. Buffet breakfast was included, and very good.  Only ate in the restaurant at night once, only negative for me.  Possibly just the choice that night.  Bar staff outstanding.  Restaurant staff very efficient.  Pools a little small for the size of the resort, but the beach is just a short walk away.  Walkway to the beach is very pretty.  Definitely would recommend."
Jul 2018,20,Not what the brochure says....,"Booked this resort with my parents (75/76) and son aged 15. The setting, rooms and swimming pools looked great in the brochure... It's NOT 5 star..Firstly it says 7 swimming pools - well, if you are a hamster and don't mind swimming in circles dodging small people it's for you... but then we found a proper pool - below ground in the spa area.. HOWEVER they charge  €20 for one hours swim!!! Never heard of such a thing ... needless to say we went back to being hamsters. Room was pleasant although the maids could smack a smile on it...Don't go for the non sea view... you face a car park and breath in carbon monoxide while sunning on your balcony! We went full board, the buffet was very nice with a good choice but chaotic and very noisy in the restaurant (small people again and bad acoustics for hard of hearing father) so we insisted on seating outside. The waiting staff are brilliant - couldn't ask for more. BUT if you want to use any of the other restaurants on the resort, even if you are full board you have to pay full price!The beds on the beach are €10 for a couple of hours.. I swear the guys selling the beds must be multi millionaires! The evenings entertainment were two guys singing who, on the 1st night were most enjoyable however, they only had one set piece so by the 3rd night we knew what song was coming up - we then dodged them!As said earlier this is not a 5 star hotel.. it might look grand but the extras you have to pay far outweigh the slightly dated decor. If you don't have little ones anymore it can be quite overwhelming, although I did spot a kids club leader in the swimming pool trying to entertain the cherubs with a poorly blown up, 3ft broken net to play volleyball!  It goes without saying we will not be returning but we did enjoy our family trip away - English humour saved us!"
Jul 2018,20,Not so grand....,"Evening buffet very poor.  Poor choice and lukewarm or cold food.  Seems to be the case that Management disregard this matter as reviews on Trip Adviser regularly highlight this problem.  I myself experienced stomach problems on holiday here, something I attribute to the food.  Apartment rooms are damp and smell fusty.  Evening entertainment is virtually non existent.  Hotel much too expensive for the end product.  Beach convenient though."
Jul 2018,50,Perfect Perfect Perfect,"My boyfriend and I had booked this place for our anniversary and it was without a doubt the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The reception team were all so helpful and arranged for champagne and fruit with chocolate to be sent to our room on the first night. The man who checked us in wore a trainee badge but was an absolute pro!Our room was very spacious and we were lucky enough to have a room with an outdoor terrace facing the sea. The pool was amazing, we never struggled to get a sun bed. The hotel offers complementary beach towels which you can give in at the end of the day in exchange for fresh ones. There's a path that leads directly to the beach and the setting was truly beautiful.The breakfast buffet was delicious and there were so many options. All of the restaurants and bars had such a high quality of food and the cocktail selection was amazing. This location is brilliant for couples wanting a romantic quiet holiday away. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the old town which is ideal for exploring Albufeira. A massive thank you to all the staff at Grande Real Santa Eulalia for making our stay so memorable and enjoyable. We will definitely return!"
Jul 2018,50,Enjoyable surroundings,"Close to beach, several pools available, free bus ride into and from newtown/old town, some excursions can be arranged by them (gypsy market Loule). Restaurants food good, can be busy so allow extra time. Very clean, all staff very helpful and polite. If you make an effort to learn some of the basic language whilst you are there they'll help with that too."
Jul 2018,50,Lovely family Christmas & New Year,What a fabulous resort.... lovely 1 bedroom apartment (be sure to ask for a sunny apartment as many get little sun in winter).Top notch buffet breakfast with many gluten & dairy free choices.We only ate dinner at the hotel once & it was excellent.  Christmas lunch was also very good.Our then 6 year old son loved the kids club.Lovely Beach right below hotel with a lovely cafe nearby.Walks over cliffs were really spectacular from the beach.Even a nightclub within the grounds which was excellent - far away from rooms. Staff were all amazing.Plenty of restaurants nearby.One of outdoor pools was heated but still a bit chilly for me!Lovely spa too.  New Year’s Eve had fireworks too!Highly recommended will be there again this Christmas!
Jul 2018,20,Very pleased,"From walking through large glass doors to reception to leaving 10 days later everything was lmpressive, from a more than satisfactory room with maidservice second to none (the chocolates offered each evening went down a treat) to the variety of food offered at the buffet restaurant and the view from our room, made our stay one to re ender."
Jul 2018,30,It’s not 5 star it’s the little things,"This hotel could be perfect. It’s a very family oriented hotel with no real couples here, you can’t swim in the pools as the kids are playing which is fine if you don’t advertise the hotel as perfect for couples as well. Dinner which was lovely included a young child playing her recorder on the next table .., there are some great restaurants with in a 20 min walk. we had to check out of our apartment we discovered by 10 am on the Sunday and when we asked for a short extension we were met with a shrug. It’s not really 5 star but it could be.."
Jul 2018,40,Nice hotel but not 5*,We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in june a group of 5 girls. We asked for 2 rooms together but were put in the apartments 3 of us and the othe 2 in the hotel 5 mins away if we had been told this before our trip we would have paid extra for 2 apartments. The hotel was 4* the apartments maby a 3* very basic and not comfortable beds. There was very few sun loungers around the pool so we had to buy lilos to lie out from the shop. Not really what you would expect after paying for a 5* hotel. Also paid for the breakfast and it wasnt nice we had to eat out instead. If you are looking to be within walking distance of shops restaurants stay else where nearest shop is 20 min walk and everything else is a taxi ride away
Jul 2018,40,Good family holiday but could be better,"Spent 10 nights here on a family holiday, in general the hotel is good.  We stayed in one of the apartments which suited us well, apartments are well equipped and gives you that extra space that yo7 don’t have with a hotel room which is good if you are travelling with children.I would of given the resort a score of 5 but for the few things that could of been better.1. Only one restaurant open even though 3 were advertised on booking and the food in the restaurant that was open was of poor quality nothing for children even though it says this a family resort.2. No night entertainment for children, just a singer in the bar each night.3. Only pool bar open was at the main pool at the hotel, the bars near the apartment pools where closed even though these areas where busy.Positive points1. The shuttle bus to the old town.2. Staff are excellent and always willing to help, the cleaning staff do an excellent job one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in.3. Beach close by and easily accessible.I would stay here again but hope they can get their act together concerning dining and entertainment."
Jul 2018,50,Wonderful family detsination,"Overall a very suitable destination for families. Offers a relaxing environment with sufficient activities within the resort and on the beach to cater for all family members, away from the hustle and bustle of the town (although still easily accessible by a 5 minute taxi ride costing 5-6 Euros).Positives:- Kids club was pleasantly beyond our expectations. They had the children joyfully busy all day- Proximity to the beach- Several pools located throughout the resort- Housekeeping was very efficient.- Extremely helpful staff who accommodated all our requests. A special thanks to Mr. Joao Cruz the front desk manager who was always there to help and make spot-on recommendations.Only one minor negative point; not a huge issue, but I guess the timetable of the shuttle bus to the old town should be extended beyond 6pm"
Jul 2018,50,Beautiful place,"We have been coming here for over 4 years, it is a great location and if you want to see more the bus service is great from the hotel itself.  Room service is second to none. Reception is always helpful and polite , overall nothing is to much.  The beach is on your doorstep and beautiful. Every meal has been lovely and the drinks and service are very good quality. Love coming back as I know I will have a lovely holiday"
Jun 2018,40,Ann,"We returned here after visiting ladt year however after checking in and being told there was a choice of 3 restaurants there was only actually one.  The pergola restaurant and santa eulalia restaurant which we had been looking forward to using were closed for the whole duration due to ""technicaL problems"" Not happy that we werent told what these were and that we had to leave the hotel every night to eat out as the only remaining  restaurant wasn't what we fancied"
Jun 2018,40,Holiday,"We visited the hotel for the 2nd time in two years.  The location of the hotel is fabulous and last year we did not leave the resort for 7 days as the food, location and kid club was excellent.  This year we arrived in June and to our disbelief the same activities, food and entertainment was not in place despite the hotel being full!  Really disappointing as we had to leave the resort and find dinner options further afield.  Albufeira (hell) is only ten minutes away which we visited on one night but never again.  Would visit the hotel again but only on the pre text that everything is open and running.."
Jun 2018,40,"Lovely hotel, not quite 5 star","We had a lovely holiday here. I was not at all impressed with Albufeira itself (lager lout hell) but the hotel was an oasis away from the tackiness.  We stayed in a sea view (worth the extra money) one bedroom suite. The rooms very  clean, very spacious and with a little hallway and two doors separating the sitting room from the bedroom, it was perfect for us and our teenage son. He even had his own bathroom! The breakfast was very good except for the cooked meats but I think that’s just down to the fact that irish sausages and bacon are better than those on the continent. A chef made omelettes to order every morning which I thought was a nice touch. I liked the coffee (my husband didn’t).  Lunches were good and the pool bar did even cheaper options on filled rolls and sandwiches etc. We only ate dinner once at the hotel. It was good but there are better restaurants for dinner just outside the resort (the portobello across the road is excellent). The pool was lovely if a little cold and it was great having access directly to the small beach. Unfortunately our air conditioning wasn’t working during our stay and couldn’t be repaired!! That coupled with the somewhat dated decor in parts of the hotel stopped me giving 5 stars. I’d still recommend this hotel!"
Jun 2018,50,Very happy with my holiday.,Firstly i was very impressed with how we were welcomed at the reception and how we were golf carted out to our apartment.The apartment was amazing and very spacious! Very neat and tidy. The kitchen however was very confusing until i got the hang of using the stove and the microwave. As we were on self catering sometimes we would go out to eat around the strip or have room service! Room service was always amazing! They would come in and lay a table cloth on the table and lay all your food on the table. Personally ive never had room service to do that before so i loved it! It came to the day of my birthday! After a long day at Slide & Splash we came back to our apartment and was very surprised to see on the table a bottle of champagne and a birthday cake for me with a candle on it and also a birthday card from the staff! I nearly cried! Ive never had anyone do that for me before. I appreciated it so much and it made my day! Thank you so much! Overall our experience was amazing and the staff were amazing! I would definately come back for sure! Thank you for making our holiday even more perfect!
Jun 2018,40,Nice Hotel but not 5 star,"The hotel was well situated looking over its own bay. First impressions was good as we pulled into the drive and reception. We had a sea view room which was spacious, clean and comfortableBreakfast was nice in the light and clean restaurant especially the pastries which have made a mess of my waistline. The evening meals however was far from a 5 star standard. Only a small serving pass made for some queue dodgers and we thought the choice was small. The quality of the food was ok but only ok. We had to complain on the second day due to flies around the food but to the credit of the duty manager, she was very apologetic and sorted the problem for us. Apparently there had been an invasion due to the change in the weather. Oh and we did notice they didn't seem to cater for the kids. No chips, pizza etc. Didn't bother us but did the younger ones want to eat rice or pasta every night ??The A La Carte menu is well worth a try. This food IS  5 star standardMost of the waiters/waitresses are very pleasant and quick to serve or clean your tables.The pool area is ok but busy with the normal 7.00am towel carriers heading for the sunbeds lol.We found a nice spot on a grassed area next to the beach. great for people watchingThe beach bar serves good food in the afternoon and even better ice creamThe free shuttle bus to the new and old towns are handy although the walk isn't too bad - 30minsOverall the hotel was comfortable and value for money but is was only half full. I wonder what the restaurant and pool areas are like in mid July or August"
Jun 2018,40,Our stay ,The staff at this hotel is most definitely 5 star they are top notch and well go all out for you.. the hotel it's self is nice and well kept but in need of an update the food is good and the beer is cold and the views are fab the rooms are big but out dated but very clean I would stay here again my kids loved it
Jun 2018,40,Beautiful hotel in stunning location.,"I am still at hotel. Unfortunately go home Tuesday. Wish had booked 10 days now. Not sure about 5 star, apart from the staff who are the most professional and lovely people. 5 star service always in reception at the bar. Can't do enough for you. Staying in apartment which has everything you could possibly want.HD golf buggy ride with our cases to the appartment. Awesome touch. Oh and the cocktails whilst expensive in the bar, are amazing and served with freebie nibbles. Worth every penny. Stunning location beach front and great shuttle bus service to old town. If you are self catering don't go to first supermarket you find. Turn left out of entrance gate walk 15 mins and u will come across big intermarche with great value fresh produce. Proper supermarket. You can buy a fresh cooked whole piri piri chicken for under 4 euros so dining in can be done very cheaply. Make your own freshly squeezed juice in there too. Local wines lovely and asittle as 4 euro!! Highly recommend the restaurant on walk up there called casa velha for the 12.95 euro tourist menu. We had basket of bread and olives and a mixed salad starter, piri piri chicken with chips and salad, cheesecake, coffee, a port type shot and a free beer. 4 of us came to just under 52 euro and boy we were full! They serve fast between courses though!! Martins just left out of entrance also a good choice and lovely service but expect to pay easily double. The only negatives where 5 star fails here is that pool side bars all closed down, except for main pool by reception. Look like they need a good refurb too. And very disappointing that only the main breakfast restaurant open and the snack bar restaurant toward beach for sandwiches. Other hotel restaurants closed down too and no gourmet burger restaurant in site. Not quite as the hotel description for facilities. Apartments only have two chairs outside and we are a party of 3 adults! All in all though I will definitely be coming back. I don't want to leave. Oh and cleaners are incredibly hardworking and deserve a big thank you. Immaculately clean always. Fantastic holiday xxx"
Jun 2018,40,"Good Hotel for a family holiday, could be better though","We stayed in a 1 bed room self catering villa, it was great. Clean and well equipped, maid service was very good even when the little one had an “accident” during a nap they came with new sheets straight away. My only negative on the villa was it didn’t have a view from the balcony/veranda we was at the back so just facing other villas. The facilities are great, I enjoyed a great massage in the spa. Heated swimming pool was ideal and the pool area is beautiful with great sea views, plenty of parasols. Annoyingly you did need to get up early with your towels to guarantee a bed at the main pool area and that was in June I suspect at peak times it’s even harder. The pools at the villas were quieter. Entertainment was the issue for us there’s a singer in the bar which is great for adults but nothing for children after 6pm despite the numerous reviews stating this it doesn’t look like it’s going to change anytime soon. The location isn’t perfect either, it’s a 15 minute walk along a grim looking main road to the new town. There’s a free shuttle but it’s every 2 hours and stops at 6pm. In the end we found an Uber to the old town was the best way it only cost €4 each way.The New town was a little too much like Benidorm for us, drunken stag /hen parties and drink promotions everywhere plus your standard “British” bars. The Old town was more pleasant and more suited for families. In truth we found Albufeira to be too commercialised by the British, Vilamoura just down the road was a lot more picturesque. In summary fantastic hotel and facilities, just not resort we really expected."
Jun 2018,50,Friends wedding,We had a great stay here at this hotel for our friends wedding. We spent a lot the time down by the beach next to the hotel but the pool area was lovely also. Food at breakfast was nice and there was always a table free. The hotel is also walking distance to the strip of bars and to the old town. All in all we really enjoyed staying here
Jun 2018,40,Asset is beach and breakfast,"Stayed in a single room which was quite basic for a 5* hotel. No kettle which would have been nice. Room very clean and bed comfortable.Breakfast was excellent great choice for everyone . Plenty of fresh fruit, fresh bread, croissants and pastry and cooked food. You can even ask to get an omelette cooked fresh.There's a gorgeous beach about 5 minutes from hotel with lovely cafe beside it. Prices reasonable in cafe.only negative is it closes at 6 pm. Staff very friendly especially Jorge"
Jun 2018,50,Great resort for family holiday,Stayed at the hotel in June and already want to go back. Location is perfect with amazing beach on your doorstep. Plenty of pools so none feel too packed. Stayed in a one bed apartment which worked out perfect for two adults and two small kids. Breakfast was excellent and dinner also good (only starts at 7pm so not great for young kids). Staff very friendly also.
Jun 2018,40,Overall very good,"Stayed here with extended family for 7 nights. Lovely resort with access to beach providing a haven from the rowdy town of Albufeira. We had a spacious, spotlessly clean, sea-view one bedroom suite. The separate sitting room with fold out double sofa bed and second bathroom made an excellent private second bedroom for our teenage son. The breakfast was very good, apart from the sausages and bacon which I found greasy and gross!!! €9 bought a hearty lunch of a filled baguette/toastie and chips or large salad. The evening buffet was a bit hit and miss. (There’s a great Italian restaurant called the Portobello right across the road from the entrance to Grand Eulalia). The staff are very friendly and helpful from the pool cafe staff to the reception staff. The only real downside for us was that the air conditioning didn’t work in our room for the duration of our stay. Other relatives mentioned that their air conditioning didn’t work either so that might be something  to check with the hotel about before booking. Would have loved some padding or a mattress on the sun loungers (most 5 star resorts have these). Overall this is a friendly, clean and spacious seafront property which ticks most of the boxes. I’d give it a 4 star rating overall. It’s not total luxury but it’s a very good place to stay."
Jun 2018,30,Nice hotel,"Lovely setting on the beach.  Nice rooms,    Breakfast good.   Transport buses, taxis and car spaces great.  Food ok.  Drinks in the bar very expensive.    12 Eur for 2 Small glasses of local port.  A Bottle of port can be  bought for less than 5eur in the supermarket"
Jun 2018,50,Family holiday ,"Had a lovely holiday here in June.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, especially on reception and the pool bar.  The food in the restaurant is good and nothing is too much bother, if there isn’t something there they will try and accommodate you.  However, there is not much option in the evening for younger children.  The rooms could do with a bit of touching up, however the maids do a wonderful job cleaning  and keep the rooms really clean with fresh linen and towels every day.  We had a sea view room.  The hotel is situated on a beautiful beach and they have a beach cafe and there is a small shop on the beach.  There are a few restaurants close by and a supermarket.  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to Albufeira new town and old town every two hours until 6.25pm and then a taxi back will cost around €7 from the old town.The entertainment is good, there is a singer on most nights.There are a few pools scattered around, however there is only one heated pool, so it gets a bit crowded as the other pools were quite cold, which was my only issue at the hotel.  There are free towels for the pool and beach.I would recommend a stay here, we enjoyed it."
Jun 2018,50,A fabulous place,"What can I say about this place other than its fabulous. I haven't been on a package holiday for seventeen years, always choosing to go to Asia because of the European package holiday negativity from days gone by when allocation on arrival was en vogue and holidays were cheap. I'm so glad things have changed. Both Jet2 and Santa Eulalia made this week's holiday an absolute dream. They're incredibly well organised, helpful, approachable, sincere and professional. From the moment we arrived at Manchester airport to the moment we came back, nothing was too much trouble and everything was brilliantly communicated in terms of pick up times, excursions etc. The staff at Santa Eulalia are incredible, even sending me a cake and wine for my birthday via room service because they happened to notice my date of birth on my passport. If that was a ploy to get me to go back, it worked. We'll be going back to this same resort next year. The room was perfect, incredibly clean and you can just tell that the owners and managers of the resort and indeed Jet2 have thought things through and ensure you can just relax and enjoy your holiday. Nothing is too much trouble for them. Well impressed in summary, well done Santa Eulalia and Jet2, you surpassed my expectations and thankyou for treating me like a valued customer. It was a break my wife and I really needed and you made it a special one."
Jun 2018,40,Great couples break,"Lovely room with comfortable bed. We went for the Bed and Breakfast, there were lots of different food choices at breakfast. Love;y staff very helpful and friendly. Pool side was nice. Had dinner in fish restaurant a couple of times which was delicious, thoroughly enjoyed this break,"
Jun 2018,50,Loved this hotel ,"From the moment   we got there I felt comfortable, the staff are so welcoming and helpful , showed us all we needed to know about our room , we opted for the bed and breakfast board which was perfect for us and the breakfast selection was huge , I ate far to much ! At the start of the week getting by the pool was no problem but as we came to the end of our holiday it was getting busy and the same old reserving your bed early had to be done , but this is the case everywhere I have been. We used the cafe along the front for lunch as the view was so pretty and food was quick and good, in the evenings we went out a 15 min walk to new town. We would then come back to hotel for one of their cocktails which were lovely , the bar in the hotel is a little pricey but again it’s a hotel and to be expected , the staff there were very busy but again very polite and always had a smile for you .our bed in our room was amazing it was a queen size bed and this is the first time I haven’t craved for my own bed.  So overall I liked this hotel a lot , right on the beach , pool area is nice , staff are great , easy to get to old and new towns , our room was kept spotless , we hope to be back again , thank you"
Jun 2018,30,Average Hotel,"We stayed in the GRSE as we were getting married in Portugal. Having stayed in a suite which was dated, dirty floors and cracked tiles, we thought this was bad. We then split our stay  and stayed in an apartment for 6 nights , Well we will most defiantly not be back. The rooms were an absolute disgrace.  The floors were disgusting, our balcony was disgusting and full of debris and dirt. The paint on the walls was crumbling off, our hanger in the wardrobe fell off. Having got married in another 5* during that stay, it is clear this is 100% not a 5* hotel. it needs alot of money invested in it because it is very dated and to be at the level of the other 5* hotels in Portugal."
Jun 2018,50,Great for quiet relaxing ,I am currently in this hotel on a bed and breakfast basis staying in a studio apartment.Arrived at the hotel Saturday at 1pm thinking we would have to wait 4pm to gain entry to room. Room was ready. The room was situated close to main gate 5 minutes walk to main hotel. It was peaceful and quiet and a sun trap come afternoon. The room is spotlessly cleaned. Clean towels daily and sheets changed every second day. Sorry and thank you to the cleaning lady who washed my dishes I was outside having lunch. The rooms are perfect if you plan to self cater. Everything looked new.Breakfast is what you expect and lots of choice. The resort is beautiful though didn’t spend a lot of time in the hotel as like to explore. The staff were friendly and hardworking. They can organise taxis if you don’t want to use courtesy bus or miss last one €4 to new town €7 to old Albufeira.Would recommend this hotel to families and couples. I would definitely return.
Jun 2018,30,Little Disappointing,We arrived at the hotel early and my husband had emailed ahead asking could we perhaps check in early as I was 5 months pregnant. Unfortunately this was not possible. Upon our stay I asked for an iron twice I was assured it would be brought to my room this never happened and no tea/ coffee facilities available in our room. As a 5 star hotel I expected a little more. Also I felt the dining experiences in the hotel were very expensive compared to the rest of the resort. The food was basic for the price being charged. However the staff were very welcoming the hotel was very clean and the overall experience good.
Jun 2018,50,Still as good as ever!,"Not the hotels fault that the wind was whistling round our ears!Other than that the staff were excellent, the room ready when we arrived, the breakfasts were amazing. It’s a super hotel within comfortable distance of Albufeira but without the noise!I would thoroughly recommend it."
Jun 2018,10,"Dated, Slow Service, Poor Food Options","What a letdown this place was! My room was in ""the apartments"", a five minute walk from the main hotel, but backed up against local housing where the kids from outside th property were up screaming every day at 6am. The room was dated and mildewy. The food was sub-par in selection and quality from every other European resort that I stayed at. The restaurant hostess was abrasive at times and did not give off a friendly vibe. My first day at breakfast, after seating me, I got up to get food and came back to find my table re-sat with other people. Checkout was a nightmare...stood in line for 15 minutes while only 3 people were trying to check out in front of me, and had to leave in order to not miss my train. Two of those people were trying to switch the billing to credit cards other than the one they held the room with, and the staff acted like this was the first time they had ever experienced something like this. At the train station I ran into several others who had been staying at this property for our conference and heard that many people had extra charges added to their bill. Still waiting to get mine emailed from the hotel. Much better options in the the Algarve than this property."
Jun 2018,10,Give it a miss,"If you’re looking for a great place to stay in the area, give this one a miss. Had to change rooms after the first night as the one we were in smelled bad, no cushions on any of the club chairs, minimal activities  and the staff were miserable. Booked for 7-nights and checked out after 3 with no reimbursement. Have been to 90-countries and stayed at a lot of hotels, this one won’t be revisited. Other guests we talked to were saying how disappointed they were too."
Jun 2018,50,Fantastic ,Just back... Hotel is amazing everyone in the hotel work so hard to make you happy will definitely Be coming back the only think I found was the price of drinks very expensive but all in all fantastic hotel would recommend this hotel to anyone thank you for an amazing stay
Jun 2018,50,Family holiday,"Booked an apartment in this hotel and asked for pool view and got an apartment right beside pool,so handy with young children and never too busy,apartment itself was lovely and spotless,cleaned everyday.the Wi-Fi was great with young kids and some stations were we could watch films and programmes.the free bus down to old town was great service and lovely resteraunt just outside called Martin's.the holiday was a joy due to staying in these apartments,all the home comforts and kids loved it here,definetly be back and would definetly give it 5 star review,staff very friendly and view out near bar having a drink amazing,5 minute walk to beach."
Jun 2018,50,Lovely as always ,"We had our wedding here in May 2017 & went back to celebrate our 1st anniversary in May 2018. Our wedding was perfect, the setting is stunning & our guests were so impressed! The hotel helped organise everything & I mean everything!! Nothing was too much trouble for Angela & Patricia even recommending celebrants, lawyers, make up artists & florists. We could not believe our luck. The day was perfect. Our return visit this year was every bit as good if just a little quieter without 70 of our nearest & dearest! We got to explore more of the hotel, resort amenities & beach this time, even more to love! The hotel even had complimentary champagne in our room....even more to love! The hotel & rooms are spotless, the buffet breakfast is outstanding, there is so much to choose from...or have a wee bit of everything lol! There’s even prosecco on offer at that time of the morning if the notion takes you?! I like the fact that it’s away from the old & new town - means you can visit there if you like & then chill back at the hotel. A taxi is about €7 but there is a shuttle bus from the hotel. It’s walkable too 45mins (25 min run) to the old town & about 15 to the strip/new town. The lovely little town of Olhos De Auga is about 20 mins to the right of the hotel. It has a beautiful wee beach & some very good restaurants/bars etc. I couldn’t recommend this resort highly enough!! I look forward to spending many more anniversaries here."
Jun 2018,50,Fabulous !,"We had the pleasure of spending 5 days here last month.This is a really lovely hotel. We found it to be low key very relaxed and chilled. We had a garden room. It was large and very comfortable with a huge bathroom and an excellent shower. The standard of housekeeping in the room was second to none, with two daily visits. The standard of cleanliness throughout the hotel and grounds was very impressive. Staff were, without exception, pleasant helpful and eager to please, meaning the service in all areas was of a very high standard. Really impressive.The grounds are beautiful, all the way down to the beach. Pool area lovely. The food was nice, maybe not completely to my personal taste, but that’s just me, my partner enjoyed it. There was plenty to choose from and we found the dining room not too busy. There isn’t much within walking distance nearby, but the hotel run an excellent bus service into town every day. Taxis were also cheap enough to use often.We loved this hotel, and would certainly recommend it to anyone, whatever age, who is looking for a peaceful relaxing few days away, being looked after by a team of very professional, hard working people. Not forgetting, In the most gorgeous surroundings !!"
Jun 2018,40,Lovely spacious hotel,"The hotel is approx 30 mins away from the airport in a taxi. Check in was quick and easy and we were taken to our rooms via golf buggy. Our one bedroom apartment had a typical Portuguese decor which was lovely and was very spacious with a large terrace to sit out - we were ground floor (the biggest apartment we have stayed in). Travel cot provided and a high chair delivered free on request. All amenities provided to cook in the apartment should you wish. A couple of supermarkets close by for bread, milk, beer etc. Lots of pools to sit around and a heated pool in the main hotel area by the pool bar. A 5/5 would have been given if the pool bars were open around the other pools but they looked closed for good. A few drinks and bar snacks by the pool would have been perfect however we just made our own sandwiches and brought our own drinks to the pool area. Very close to the beach and a lovely beach it is with water sports available. The hotel bar/restaurant overlooking the beach was very nice although not the cheapest (€6 for a glass of wine). The beach bar on the beach was cheap and cheerful if wanting a drink and a bar snack (€10 for 2 toasties and 2 beers - very reasonable).10-15 minute walk to the strip (new town) with many bars and restaurants to choose from. The Chinese at the roundabout is cheap and awesome food, also try Sizzling stone restaurant (straight on at the roundabout on the right hand side).The hotel provides a free bus to the old town 5 times a day. The old town is lovely and well worth a visit. We also walked a 25 min walk to olhos d’agua (opposite direction to the strip). A small town nearby with a few restaurants to eat dinner or tea. We arranged our transport to and from the airport with Portuguese firm yellow fish online prior to flying out, I would highly recommend this firm (car seat provided for our 8 month old). €85 return for a minibus for 7 people. Overall, we would definitely return to this lovely hotel should we return to Portugal."
Jun 2018,50,Family Wedding,"Absolutely beautiful complex. Next to the beach and set in lovely grounds with three pools, beach bar and kids play area. Me and hubbue stayed in a studio apartment which was spacious, clean and had pretty much everything we needed. Nice added touch of dressing gowns,shampoos etc. The room was cleaned daily and fresh towels were provided daily if you wanted them,Beach towels are also provided.It was a good 15 minuted to the strip but we don’t mind a walk so that want a problem. There’s a supermarket and a couple of restaurants close by if you don’t fancy the trek. The wedding was amazing - food and staff great. Would definitely stay there again . Ideal for couples and families."
May 2018,40,Beautiful resort with private beach,"The resort is grande as it’s name . Well spread out rooms and apartment style accommodations which were very spacious separate living dining kitchen area with crockery cutlery provided . It’s ideal if you kids , you can cook there or warm up food.Beach side there is an area for the hotel guests and another area where you have to pay 5 Euros for the chair and another 5 for umbrella.May was still too cold to swim but still we had a good time as we were spending quality family time together.Shuttle buses are available for drops to old and new town."
May 2018,30,Lovely location but not 5 star,Chose  the hotel for its spa and location- but disappointed with the spa- 20 euros per day and the spa was not fully functional - only offered 2 Euro discount!Pools were really coldBreakfast was lovely with a huge choice of fresh fruit and hot food.However the dinner buffet was not great- food was lukewarm and the choice was not as great as other 5 star hotels I have stayed in.The staff are lovely and friendly.
May 2018,20,Grande Unrealistic ...,"Was very much looking forward to enjoying a well deserved break away, with the family. But what we got was far from it.What hotel that dares to consider itself a five staff resort, thinks that it is ok to hold a corporate event in the middle of the main lobby / reception area and not in a designated suite, forcing its holidaying guests to such an welcoming experience, that they need to leave the resort, just to spend quality family time together. Shame on the management and shame on the staff for treating returning guests in such a fashion.When we arrived, we were told that half the restaurants were closed and as we were really looking forward to one in particular, you can imagine our disgust, when we see it being opened for the corporate people.Do you not think it honourable to inform guests upon check in of what their week would entail?And do you not think it loyal to guests staying in the hotel to be treated to maybe small discount in the spa etc, over those that can freely stroll through the front gate?It will be the last time that we will come to this hotel, quite frankly this is not a five star resort, 3.5 to 4 max, but definitely not a 5 and the attitude that it has shown this week places it even lower in my humble estimation.Others may have a different opinion on their experience at Grande Real Santa Eulália and that’s their right, but that’s why it’s called a review."
May 2018,30,Great location but only 3 star,"We recently stayed at the resort. We could not find availability through the hotel's website so booked through Alpharooms. We booked a studio apt with breakfast. It was not made clear that the apartments were separate from the hotel. We had in fact wished to book a hotel room but there were none available which on arrival we figured was due to a conference in the hotel the week we were there.The location is great. Short stroll to the beach. Beach is lovely. Great little beach cafe and some pedal boats and sunbeds etc available.Pool area in hotel side of resort nice. Food not great in pool bar. Pools are freezing. One was heated but not through the entirety of our stay and still quite cool. Decking around pools was being revarnished while we were there and was cordoned off for 3 days making it hard to access pools plus the smell was overbearing so we went to beach. The day after the work was finished the decking was still tacky to walk on.Pool areas on apartment side not as well maintained. Chipped tiles in pool. Decking looks a bit worse for wear. Pool bar not open.Very clinical feel to hotel and definitely more a business hotel than family friendly.Food at breakfast good. Fresh fruit, usual continental and hot food. Lovely cheeses.Studio apartment was good size. Good kitchen area. Well stocked with appliances and cutlery etc. Towels were changed daily and beds made. However it is very dated and as seen in previous review pictures the decor is dated and colours a bit odd. The curtains didn't fully close on the sliding doors. The fly curtains were ripped. The curtains were hanging from rail in places. Weird stains/drip marks on top of walls. Bed linen stained. Brown blankets on bed which are a massive No No for me and not something you would expect in a 5 star resort.Pillows were flat and soft.  Bed really hard.Don't think floor was ever mopped as my 4 year olds feet were black after a few minutes on the first day so he never went without flip flops inside.Would return to the area but unfortunately not to this hotel."
May 2018,50,Fabulous return trip to Grande Real,"This was our second stay at the Grande Real. On arrival we got an upgrade to a suite. It was just fantastic. Two double rooms, both ensuite, one with a jacuzzi.Even though our trip was January the weather was lovely and we enjoyed the outdoor heated pool. We enjoyed daily walks on the fabulous beach adjoining the hotel. We stayed half board on this occasion and enjoyed breakfast every day, somedays opting for lunch and somedays dinner. Food was delicious, with a good choice for vegetarians. The burger bar was closed the week we stayed so we did miss that and look forward to dining their on our return.We returned from our trip energised and very relaxed. A perfect way to break up our long winter. We have already booked our next visit. We would like to take time to compliment the entire team at the hotel. Friendly, warm and helpful. We have definitely found our home away from home at the Grande Real S. E."
May 2018,40,"Lovely peaceful setting, right on the beach","We had a great deal in September, the hotel and seaview room were great, fantastic choice at breakfast, and very fresh. At this time of year be aware that not all facilities are open, the nightclub looks fantastic right on the beach but was not open when we were there and only one bar open. A short walk to the bars and restaurants and there is a courtesy bus to take you into Albufeira. Local busses are easy to use, there is a stop just outside the grounds, to Albufeira or Villamora."
May 2018,10,Bad and dirty,Well once again due to business I stayed here. The hotel exterior is lovely even the houses are gorgeous and well maintained but the interior is bad and every year it seems to be worse. Lots of hairs on the floor and in the bed as you can see in the photos. No WiFi reception. Totally a nightmare. It really needs some updates
May 2018,30,5 STAR LOCATION NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL,"loved the setting of this hotel the grounds and views were outstanding but this is were the 5 star rating ended.  The hotel was very quiet at night as entertainment was limited.  The hotel holds a lot of conferences during the day.  We chose bed and breakfast as the hotel had various restaurants so we thought there would be a good choice to pick from.  Went to the burger restaurant one night to find it was closed, a member of staff said it would be closed for a month to cater for weddings, this meant every night we went outside the hotel to eat.  There was a buffet restaurant which cost 60 euro per couple but as the breakfast was of poor quality we decided against trying it.  On the subject of breakfast it was poor never hot and always overcooked.  There is a bus to take you into Albufeira but this stopped at 6.15 and I must say the bus driver was the rudest man I have ever come across.  The hotel is a bit tired with no soul, sorry I would not return."
May 2018,30,Kids paradise,We are still here and what we thought was going to be a relaxing holiday with our friends is actually turning out to be hard work.The resort is great for young children and not for couples .There have also been conferences on most days with delegates children running around screaming even at 9.30pm in the restaurant !!!!!The rooms are lovely and we are enjoying some of the food even though its not kept hot enough.The evening entertainment is limited but nice enough bar/lounge areas.Not much atmosphere .Could do with softer lighting!The staff are friendly and polite.If there are kettles available it would help if this was made aware in the hotel amenities section.Lovely hotel but not for us.
May 2018,50,Enjoyable Second Visit,"We love the self catering apartments here. They are in a good location with the hotel facilities and the beach close to hand. We made use of the restaurant on the beach front, enjoying the great views and reasonable prices for food and drinks. The apartments are well stocked and so on but take your own tin opener! We hired a car this time and parking in the underground car-park was easy enough, keeping the car cool. There was always space but might get busy in peak season.Our apartment was kept clean and stocked by Svetlana. There was a language barrier but she was genuinely pleased to see us again. She is a lovely person and takes pride in her job.The reception staff are very professional and helpful. It's a pleasure staying here and we are already looking at returning again next year.Booking trips and hiring a car is easy. Reception will assist you or you can go out of the gate and turn right. You'll find a small ""portacabin"" building on the left, which offers trips and so on. We hired our car with them, using Panda car hire. Petrol is a bit more expensive than here but it's relatively easy to drive in Portugal. Assuming reasonable mobility, there are other restaurants and supermarkets within easy walking distance too but early May can still be a bit cool in the mornings and evenings."
May 2018,50,Perfect quiet holiday,Fantastic resort. A little away from the hustle and bustle. We stayed in one bed apartment it had everything. The little touches like a kids dressing robe and kids soap in bathroom. The cleaner was amazing came everyday and we were messy with 2 kids. There was plenty of seats at pool and kids pool was perfect for toddlers. Main pools were a bit cool. Direct access to the beach to which is great could spend one half of day on beach other by pool. Reception staff were warm in friendly on check in we were a bit tired and cranky at 10pm with a 4 and 2 year old.they rushed everything along. No need for towels as the hotel provides them. Also Wi-Fi in hotel and apartments was great. The only down side was the distance to town and it was up and down hill. There was a shuttle bus to old and new town but last bus was 6.25 and no return for that time. Taxi was between 7 and 8 euro from old town.
May 2018,50,Excellent!!,"The hotel is beautiful and immaculately clean, the rooms are cleaned daily and the maid even washed our babies bottles out for us which was lovely, we stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment which we couldnt fault, huge bed, decent size bathroom and living areas and good facilities, the staff in the hotel are excellent and do the best to help you in anyway possible. There are a few pools to choose from and it is located right on the beach, the only downside to the hotel is it is located quite a distance from the new and old town, they do provide a free shuttle bus but we just used taxis costing 10 euros per trip  to the old town. All in all a well managed and beautiful hotel where nothing is too much trouble, would most definately  recommend!"
May 2018,50,Perfect setting for a Wedding,"My Son had his wedding here and it was Amazing , they couldn't have picked a better place . If you want a holiday with no worries , every thing to hand , and 5 star luxury , This Is the place for you . Staff are fantastic , and the Food , it matches everything else , Amazing"
May 2018,50,conference,stayed in the hotel during conference for 7 nights.Stayed in suite with view to the pool and sea.A very nice resort close to the sea.excellent very big beds.Conference area and rooms very good.Very good breakfast.
May 2018,40,Lovely place,"Our first visit to the Algarve staying at the Grande Real for 10 nights on a self catering basis. To be honest, we found our accommodation and the hotel facilities to be faultless. The staff and service was just delightful. Absolutely no trouble to do anything for their guests. The room we had was lovely and kept spitlesslt clean by the daily maid service. Plenty of pools to choose from and easy access to the beach. Car hire was organised by the staff and we also used the free bus into the old town. I would definitely recommend the hotel and accommodation to anyone wanting good facilities in a central location."
May 2018,30,Below the expectations...,"Stunning location by the sea.The rooms need refurbishment and modernization. On the ground floor, facing the entrance, you cannot have the windows open because there’s no privacy...Breakfast was not 5 stars..."
May 2018,40,Short Break,"Myself, partner & toddler really enjoyed our short break at this resort. The hotel arranged taxis via May which were excellent & reliable. We stayed in an apartment on the resort which was large, clean & comfortable. The food in the restaurants was very good. Access to pools & beach & facilities were excellent. We loved this hotel by day but by night it was very drab and boring. The ‘Real Bar ‘ entertainment was 1 man with a guitar who was easy listening but we were lulled to sleep by 10 each night. Free Shuttle bus to old town for evening meals was preferable than staying in hotel as there was more of an atmosphere."
May 2018,40,Good value for money but not 5 stars ,"I got a good deal on a package holiday here so can’t complain about value for money, however I would say the hotel is not 5 date as advertised. Perfectly nice, but apartments are definitely more 3 star, and pool areas 4 star. Only real issue I had was with the food served at the resort - very underwhelming and overpriced. But otherwise had a good trip."
May 2018,50,Short break,"What a great hotel, our stay has been lovely , the staff are excellent and nothing is to much bother.Breakfast is not rushed and a good selection.We also had something to eat by the pool and a Buffett meal in the evening.They also have a free bus service to visit old and new town.And great private beach.The only thing missing is tea and coffee making facilities in the room.Which is our preference.We will definitely be coming back to this lovely hotel.Thank you for a wonderful stay."
May 2018,50,"Pretty, pretty good",A fine international hotel indeed. Room spotlessly clean.Staff always greet you with a smile. Nice swimming pool area with outside bar. Choice of restaurants in the hotel.If the only thing I can find to complain about is the luke warm porridge at breakfast then I think we made a great hotel choice.Beach is easily accessible from the hotel with sun beds for hire near the beach bar (not run by the hotel).We would stay here again without hesitation.
May 2018,10,5 star definitely no more than a 3,"Very very disappointed we booked this hotel as it was advertised as a 5 star. Definitely no more than a 3 star. Clientele definitely only a 3 star standard all on Cheap bargain breaks from uk ,,,,,Hotel definitely needs to be refurbished and re rated..."
May 2018,40,Good for families,"Recently stayed for a week the facilities are good if a little dated. The location of the hotel is ideal for families, I found all the staff very friendly and the food was good that was served in all of the restaurants. The only negative I could say were the beds were not that comfortable!! All in all we would return again."
May 2018,50,review of hotel,"Hotel in general is perfect! The staff is absolutely amazing - very friendly, always ready to help, nice personality!Amenities are good, food also good, may be will be better to have more variety of hot dishes during breakfast.The only discomfort was - inability of getting satisfaction from swimming - ocean in May is extremely  cold and water in swimming pools were also cold, so may be in future hotel thinks to have even one pool with heated water, that will expand time of resort functioning..."
May 2018,50,Amazing stay 2nd year in a row,"What can I say!!  We have just returned from an amazing 10 day stay and from start to finish had the best time.  Myself, my husband, two small kids (4 and 5) and my parents are already looking forward to returning next May.  There are so many highlights.  The kids club was just incredible.  My kids were already looking forward to it from our trip last year and they ran in the first morning and every morning for the rest of their stay.  They loved all of the various activities and made lots of friends.  Marta, Telma, Jaoa, Paolo, Jessica, Ricardo and the rest of the team are so nice, so much fun and really made the holiday memorable for the kids and also gave us such peace of mind,  Telma babysat for us too on a number of occasions and was so kind and my daughter really looked forward to Telma babysitting.  My Mum and I availed of the fitness classes which Jaoa and Ricardo run twice a day.  They were excellent classes.  Whatever level of fitness you have is catered for and both trainers are highly experienced and fun.  I would definitely recommend them if you can tear yourself away from the sun loungers.  The reception staff are so friendly and helpful, particularly Jerome.  All of the restaurant staff are great.  We stayed in an apartment overlooking the pool and it was incredibly clean and cleaned daily which was brilliant.  My parents had a gorgeous sea view room in the hotel.  Overall, we had the most incredible relaxing, fun and enjoyable holiday and are already planning our return next May.  Thanks to all of the great staff for a memorable holiday.  We really appreciate it."
May 2018,50,Relaxed atmosphere is stunning surroundings,"The hotel upon arrival greeted us with a beautiful lobby and efficient staff. We were initially given a room with just a partial sea view and when I asked reception to change us to a more central sea view  they accommodated us immediately. They even suggest we go for lunch while they made arrangements and moved our bags for us. We were staying on a full board basis. Breakfast, lunch and dinner in the buffet restaurant. However we also received 1 dinner in the gourmet burger restaurant (fabulous) and 1 dinner in the Santa Eulália restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised with this as it broke up the buffet dinner dining. Also, the buffet restaurant turns al a carte at lunch with is very nice. I recommend the sea bream. The hotel offers private access to the public beach where beach beds can be rented for €15. Well worth it. You can leave your towels there and pop up to the restaurant for lunch then back to the beach. The views of the Atlantic are stunning. A beautiful sea breeze is always there to keep you cool. In general, the hotel is at the lower end of 5 stars but when compared with other available 5 star hotels in the area it offers good value. We decided to extend our stay by 2 nights and we were kindly offered the same room and a 10% discount (breakfast only). The hotel grounds are spacious enough that it never felt crowded. There is a free bus service 6 times a day that drops you directly at the beach in Albufeira Old Town if you feel like a change of scene. Saying that, there is little reason to leave the hotel if you’re just here to relax. The staff are very helpful, especially Manuela in the dining area. I will definitely be returning for another trip."
May 2018,50,Excellent Stay!,"Couldn't state any flaws, perfect in every sense for what a 5 star property speaks for!Very courteous staff and made our stay really special for daughter's birthday complimentary treat. Tried the seafood and burger restaurant and find them 10x better than what you get in the town areaand economical too! 100% recommended"
May 2018,30,Not entirely sure why it's 5*,"This all may sound negative but it isn't, it's not a bad hotel at all it just isn't amazing. We stayed for 4 nights self catering in one of the apartments, it was good don't get me wrong but for 5* you would expect a bit more. It's hard to put my finger on what was missing though...The 2 bedroom apartment was large and clean with good facilities but i've stayed in 3 and 4* self catering apartments which offered the same or similar. The decor was bright but random looking and dated, it was right outside one of the secluded apartment block pools which was nice.The pools... Well it's more a case of quantity over quality. It's so random to have 4 or 5 small circular pools, they weren't bad or anything negative about them but not exactly 5* at all.Pool bar drinks and snacks were okay, ordered a chicken baguette to be given a tuna baguette but it may have been the language barrier, wasn't too bothered and my order was changed within 5 minutes. It was okay, nothing too glamorous.The paid extra's on offer seemed good for someone wanting that sort of thing like the spa treatments etc. We wasn't interested in those but this is probably why it has a 5* rating along with the beach location which was really nice.The staff were exactly how you would expect because they're getting paid to provide a service, so they weren't bad or amazing. Just what you expect.Unless we were missing something and there was magical place on the evening which we couldn't find, there was absolutely nothing going on in the hotel in the night. It was bizarre and because the very good bus service ended around 6pm, we found ourselves walking 15 minutes to the nearest bars and restaurants (half way between the hotel and new town) and later onto the new town.Overall the stay was good, relaxing and we enjoyed it for a short break.Just not entirely sure about the 5* and maybe more in season (July/August) this place would be very good. Maybe i'm being picky with the average rating, just my opinion."
May 2018,40,Very relaxing and enjoyable,We came on a family holiday and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. We had to move rooms during our stay but this was handled very efficiently and without issue. All staff were helpful and friendly especially with the kids.
May 2018,50,"Fabulous Resort Hotel, wonderful staff","My daughter and I are halfway through our second visit to this beautiful splendid hotel, early May 2018. The staff are helpful and friendly. We were given a warm and unexpected personal welcome from Manager João Climaco while new and smiling staff member Jorge checked us in. João placed us in a spotlessly clean, spacious room on the top level with a panoramic view of the sea, tennis courts and woods from the balcony. We found a bottle of water and a bowl of fruit waiting for us on arrival.There is a fridge and a safe in the room and there is no extra charge or deposit required. The shower is powerful and fresh towels are abundant. The housekeeping staff do a great job and there is a daily turn-down service. There are a number of English speaking channels on the TV including the BBCs and cartoon network. Fresh towels for the pool are also provided daily, free of charge. Victor noticed us returning from the pool one day with folded wet towels and he had fresh towels waiting for us by the time we reached his desk- impressive. These are the details that make staying at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia such a pleasurable experience. Today we will take the complimentary shuttle bus to the Old Town. The bus is new, large and air conditioned. Every morning here we eat breakfast at what can only be described as a banquet, with a huge variety of tropical fruit, healthy options, cold meats, hot food, porridge, yoghurt, poached, scrambled, boiled or fried eggs, a variety of cheese, rolls, pastries, coffee, tea, chocolate and juices including freshly squeezed delicious orange juice. Yes of course the fry up is different to an Irish or English fry- after all, we are in another country! We enjoyed an evening meal at the Pergula Restaurant this week, very nice indeed. We usually eat early and so we dine outside at the Atlantico with a beach view and delicious options for a light meal-see the menu on the hotel's website. This closes at 6pm outside of high season so don't arrive after 5.30pm looking for food and also bear in mind that the pool bar also closes at 6pm. My daughter is enjoying the excellent WiFi coverage here and she also likes having restaurants on site, so that we don't have to head off walking in search of dinner. There is a kids' club here and sports available for a small fee such as paddling, tennis and an introduction to scuba diving. There is table tennis also and of course the spa and treatments. What we love best about this resort are the pools- the sea water pool for me and the heated outdoor pool for my daughter, where inflatables are permitted at this time of year. Oh, and the lovely lady at the hotel shop reserved a copy of my favourite Irish Sunday paper. We are having a brilliant time- thank you to João and your team. We give you six stars!"
May 2018,50,Miss,"We had an excellent stay at the hotel.Our Room was exceptionally clean&comfortable, food was delicious&staff were so friendly and helpful.We loved the pool facilities& the free shuttle to Albuferia town.Lovely beach &surroundings also."
May 2018,40,4*,"Staff, room views excellent. (Missing coffee making facilities for a 5*). Food variety should be improved as a whole and should cater for vegetarians. We paid full board which was a waste of money due to the vareity of food. Same menu whole time we stayed was a disappointment. At least water should ba provided without charge when we paid full board. Though the restaraunt staff were very kind helpful and polite."
May 2018,50,"Great Hotel, just on top of the beach","- Great apartments, all you need is included- Private parking in case you are driving- Beach just 10-15mins walk from the average apartment- Village very near, walking distance to restaurants and super markets"
May 2018,50,Fantastic hotel,This hotel was great both location and friendliness. The staff could not of been nicer it was a birthday while here and when we arrived back at the room the hotel had left a birthday greeting and wine.
May 2018,50,"Room was great, Service was awesome!","We stayed three nights at this hotel.  We loved it.  We had a view over the pool/ocean.  The service was awesome.  They were so helpful as we had never been to Portugal before.  The food in the restaurants was excellent and the view at the restaurant closest to the beach was terrific.  My wife is so picky about where we stay but she was very happy with this one.  We bought the romantic package which included a dinner, couples massage and Champagne and chocolate truffles delivered to the room.  What a deal that was.  I would not hesitate to stay there again."
May 2018,50,Loved it,"We returned following a not so great first experience, we had high hopes! We arrived, were greeted warmly, allocated a sea view room on the 3rd floor- amazing view! Shortly after arrival we were treated to champagne and truffles- an amazing treat! The resort is open and spacious, we ate at the pergola burger bar- beautiful food and service on the first night- very tasty, breakfast was ok, the dining room is big and on warm days you can dine on the terrace, there is a great choice but on every occasion the hot food was tepid when you got back to the table, the fresh orange juice and prepared fresh fruit was lovely. It does get busy and you can end up queing if you head down around 10.We ate at the Santa Eulalia restaurant at the front overlooking the beach - wow! The service was fantastic, my husband chose the tiger prawns, myself the piri piri chicken- they were cooked on the bbq by the chef and presented beautifully! They tasted amazing- highly recommended! My only grumble would be we were not told the price of the prawns before billed so it was a bit if a shock but overall we were very happy with the evening really worth the treat!The rooms are big, you have to request a kettle & take own tea/coffee, they give u 1 bottle of water on arrival, there is a fridge in the room which will filled with our drinks as the mini bar optional.We didn't use the pool area prefering the beach but it looked well served and was popular.We had an early check out and mentioned this when settling the bill, we were offered coffee to be brought to the room at a time to suit- 4am coffee/ juice/ breads/ ham and cheese  arrived! Perfect! We took sandwiches and fruit for the plane and enjoyed the fresh brew. Overall I would recommend this resort, it has a kids club, lots if activities if you wanted to join in. We found all the staff pleasent and accommodating, I loved the 'turn down' service - what a fab idea to put a sheet next to bed to stop sand ending up in your bed! Hopefully we will be back with friends soon!"
May 2018,50,Relaxing few days,"Picked this Hotel for a 4 day break and glad i did, very nice hotel and staff were excellent.Was my birth day during the trip and this was acknowledged with a cake and bottle of bubbly which was a very nice touch. The only minor gripe was the lack of tea/coffee in the room, perhaps this is standard in many hotels these days but would and possibly will go back."
May 2018,50,"Lovely,relaxing break.","Beautiful hotel, comfortable rooms, and wonderful food.Location perfect next to beach.The bus service from the door is also good.Spa wonderful to wind down and relax.Only negative is balcony furniture is in need of replacing"
May 2018,40,"Great location, friendly personnel, nice rooms","Very nice resort with wonderful beach. Despite of many hotel rooms, never felt crowded. Very good food in various restaurants. Spa expensive, but good. Convenient shuttle service to shopping locations as well as old town."
May 2018,40,Great location + very clean,Great location ...right beside the beach and very clean..reception staff + spa therapists excellent ...however very disappointed that 3 of the hydrotherapy jets + the Turkish bath were not working on both days I was there..+ no discount or allowance offered. Also we  stayed in self catering apartment that had a very loud electical unit just outside the patio door that kept my daughter awake at night + was annoying during the day...
May 2018,40,Lovely holiday,"Truly a dream holiday my only complaint would be shame the Spa was not fully working and the steam room would work one day and not the next,Appartment was lovely however the extra visitors(ants) were not welcome but overall I would recommend this beautiful hotel.We did ask for a swimming pool view but never got it the really nice young man on reception did say I think you can see it out of your window but this was not the case!"
May 2018,40,VladPetrovich,"Absolute great location on the ocean beach. Big free parking for those who come with the car as was my case! Good spacious room and bathroom. Dinner buffet is not attractive ,the food was dead ,was befor in the fridge. But a la carte restaurants are very good with the nice menu. Recommend this hotel."
May 2018,40,Very good value in low season,"+ Good service, beautiful location, huge appartement, extended breakfast buffet. Nipping at your coffee overlooking the ocean from the Antlantico Bar is superb. Good pricing in low season. - Noisy rooms and hard beds. Kids club activities were very disappointing. Staff is very friendly but did not manage to cross the language-barriers. My daughter came back crying while she is usually very happy at kids clubs. I believe they can make much more out of it."
May 2018,50,OUT OF THIS WORLD,Just returned home from this resort and from start to finish it was a fantastic experience  we are already planning a return visit in September.  If what you are looking for is a lovely hotel on a beach with fablous beach restaurants this is the place for you.  The hotel is situated on the beautiful Santa Eulaia beach with 3 lovely beach restaurants 5 mins from your doorstep.We got upgraded to a beautiful suite overlooking the pool and the beach it was just super ...It was a special birthday for my husband and we got wine champagne and cake all delivered to the room on the day of his birthday .Fantastic king size beds and beautiful crisp bed linen.Breakfast was everything you could wish for . though Id say in high season there would be enormous queues and the only down side is you have to queue for the coffee machine  in a 5 star hotel there should be people there to serve you coffee that is the only gripe i would have  I could not recommend this hotel highly enough
May 2018,50,"Excellent Resort, Returning July '18","Stayed here in Sep '17 and the place is unbelievably amazing in every way. Rooms are spacious and well stocked with everything you could need, facilities are perfect, staff were always friendly and helpful and the location could not be better.We are re-visiting in July '18 and the reception has even confirmed that we can stay in the same room again!"
May 2018,50,November holiday,Went as a couple for a week break and had a lovely time weather was excellent you get a bus out and into the town it was so easy and loved the hotel we had an apartment it was excellent clean every day
May 2018,20,Our 3rd visit (disappointed),"We have loved this hotel in the past, Unfortunately it has become a little tired and I think the staff have too,Other than breakfast staff who were lovely nobody else seams to give a damm, The pool staff are grumpyThe reception staff are grumpy The spa staff are totally unapprchable We kept our pool towels for 4days as not used much& when we tried to exchange we were refused, The hair dryer in the bathroom kept cutting out so housekeeping brought me another one which had no nossle,It's a crying shame that this hotel didn't meet our usual expectations ,"
May 2018,50,Late April stay,Such a beautiful hotel and lovely atmosphere. Our room was very spacious with a balcony. So clean and very welcoming reception. Perfect location with a complementary shuttle to new and old town regularly.
Apr 2018,50,Our holiday,"Lovely hotel very comfortable large bed and pillows, very clean , friendly staff , great location not far from all the bars and restaurants, then back for piece and quiet and a great nights sleep would definitely stay again"
Apr 2018,30,Good Location,"Hotel location very good, you will need a car to enjoy the area. lack of visibility of management. Staff where not very welcoming or helpfull. Hotel staff could do with a lesson in smilingClenliness was not up to standard you would expect. Indoor pool charged at 18 euro per visitcooked Breakfast was poor, bacon and sausages where very poor. Main pool not heated and very cold. pool area needed a cleaner in the mornings. On the plus side plenty of sunbeds and fantastic bay.Would need to see improvements before re booking this hotel"
Apr 2018,40,good location for the beach,"good location, good quality and choice of food, expect queues for breakfast at busy times during school holidays. mini bar items had to ordered, no coffee/tea making facilities in the room, good wi fi service in the room, service and help from management and house keeping were very good. have to be reasonably fit to go down to the beach and back up. Swimming pools may be good size for kids but not for length swimming. Will go back as management agreed to address certain issues. Used the spa and it is good value for money €18 but recommended attention to detail."
Apr 2018,10,Disappointed :(,This resort is definitely not 5 *.  A big disappointment to a perfect vacation so far!! The first room 002 they gave us was really the pits. Infested with ants & a terrible musty odor. After talking to the reception they moved us to 308. Here the air conditioning didn’t work. Several other guests had a similar problem . It appears they are trying to save on their power bills & will turn it on only if a guest complains. The phone didn’t work too. The maintenance man who attended was so callous. His comment was ....“at least the television works”. There is no coffee maker or an iron. No complimentary water.  Think twice before you fall for its 5* status. Will not recommend if one is looking for 5* comfort.
Apr 2018,50,Recomended hotel,"This is our 5th stay. Need I say more. It's comfortable, food is excellent. Beach right on your doorstep. Atlantico is great for a coffee or a bite during the day. Swimming pools are just right, but we tend to go in April so the main pool is cold."
Apr 2018,40,Good but requires improvement,"Nice hotel especially if you are staying in bungalows, not rooms. Reception handles everything quickly and efficiently. Staff in restaurant are even too quick to clean plates ;) but breakfast is not that special and ordering omelette or eggs can take a while. Hotel should consider having 2 persons preparing it. Healthy options are minimal. Come on! Where is your local yoghurt? I don’t want Danone! Also there should be choice of nuts, honey and prunes in the morning. Scrambled egg is tasteless. Great choice of pastry and bread. Ham and cold meat cheap quality. Supper is much better and variety of food really good including miniature puddings and sweats. Entertainment not every day and kids club run indoors, it’s a shame as if it doesn’t rain I would prefer kids are outdoors on playground not locked in conference room!!! Swimming pools are heated but not that warm. But overall resort is good just needs a bit of improvement. Don’t know how queues are handled in peak season as you have to wait for the table sometimes for breakfast/supper."
Apr 2018,40,"5 star,,, not really","Stayed full board, would expect water to be provided free during meals,, but NO.. had to pay extra..the spa did not have sauna and steam rooms working, eventually suana turned on,, steam room still not working ,, some parts of the spa  water jets was not working,,3 sections seemed to be non operational.."
Apr 2018,40,As good as it was before!,"After two years away we went back last week for a 7-day break with the kids. I have two children 11 and 5. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment which was more than big enough. The double bed is huge, its a 4 man bed! and there is a sofabed that comfortably sleeps two. Now, it was belting of rain, it rained 4 out of the 7 days we were there (brilliant ey!!) so it was a little frustrating.  Would go back again (not in April), hire a car though, cheap and the parking is free. I hired my car via Ryanair (cheapest by far) and it was painless. Eating in the hotel is eyewatering so you won't be scoffing bottles of Barolo either, the wine is very expensive. If you're self catering you won't be eating in the hotel. A trip to the old town is 7 euros but to be honest I think it's tacky, no charm and kitted out for the lads and lassies. That said there are a few hidden gems but avoid the square. We ended up eating in a restaurant called Ocatraio - a real find."
Apr 2018,40,Family beach hotel Albufeira,"Here 's a good and honest 5 star hotel with good rooms good sun exposition pools and Sta Eulalia beach near Albufeira It's not a complete secluded domain altough it's in a good park , good parking space And the premises are very good with enough room for families and couples Good portuguese and international food and a superb breakfast The Real hotel chain is a valuable and trustful experience"
Apr 2018,50,Stayed in the hotel much better,"Writing a review again after now staying in the hotel twice not apartments and have enjoyed my visits a lotThe beach is fab and the cafe on the beach is my favourite place It’s a safe resort and beautiful Only one or two things that could improve,  the quality of the loo paper but if you’re fussy take your own"
Apr 2018,50,Very impressive hotel and service,"We stayed for 6 nights and fell in love with the resort. Beautiful kept grounds, direct access to beach, immaculate pools and a neat little gym and spa area. Staff were friendly and provided exceptional service. Breakfast was a treat every morning - as we were in quiet season we never had to queue. We were upgraded to a sea view room, and were able to arrange a late check out. My only feedback would be to suggest tea and coffee making facilities be added to rooms - I missed a cuppa in the evening. We would highly recommend the resort to singles, couples or families. Thank you for a wonderful stay - we will be back."
Apr 2018,50,Nigel,"We had stayed here as a family short break. We are really happy with the staffs as they are polite, professional and friendly. The hotel facilities are exactly what described on the hotel website. It is very good value for money."
Apr 2018,50,Just Perfect!,"We stayed at this hotel to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary. Going away without our children is a rare treat for us, so we had spent a lot of time planning the perfect holiday. We had previously stayed in the Grand Real Italia hotel in Cascais and had had an amazing time, with top notch treatment. So we again opted to go for the Grand Real chain. I can genuinely say we were not disappointed! We emailed the hotel in advance to say that we were celebrating my birthday and anniversary. When we arrived we were not initially placed in the sea view room we had asked to be upgraded to (because the hotel was full), but thanks to a wonderful staff member called Rita and Ines the Real Experience Manager, a few strings were pulled and the following day we were moved to the most beautiful room I have ever experienced. The sea view was breathtaking and I spent many hours on the balcony just watching the waves splashing onto the shore and the people strolling on the beach. We were treated like royalty from that moment on. Cake and wine arrived in our room the following day with a message wishing us happy anniversary. Throughout our stay the staff were amazing and saw to our every need. There is a bus the hotel put on that takes you to both the new and old town, the old town being the most interesting part of albufeira with many restaurants to wet your appetite, bars, shops and a beautiful beach.The breakfast served by the hotel is the best (I recommend going as early as 07:30 - 8:30 to avoid the queue) including the dinner if you were to book the half-board option. Lunch at the hotel is served as a la carte and can be expensive. If that is not a good choice, then there are several restaurants outside the hotel, including restaurant O Pescado by the hotel beach and another one within the hotel itself, which is also a fantastic choice.The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly and I highly rate their customer service, especially when it comes to going beyond and above in meeting customer needs, which was the case in our situation. I would definitely plan another visit in the future with the children because the facilities are there for them to be catered for. Above all else, I would highly recommend this hotel because of it's grand size, excellent beach location and real experience."
Apr 2018,50,Brilliant,"MY husband and u have just stayed here for three nights, I have to say it was the finest hotel we have ever stayed in. Just hone and planning our return already the staff very freindly great English also on reception. non of my request were a ptoblem. Free shuttle bus outside the door into old town or new town. Looking forward to going back"
Apr 2018,50,Lovely hotel and welcoming staff.,"We arrived before our room was ready and the member of reception staff told us where we could eat lunch in the hotel while we were waiting and that they would put our bags in their locked room. I didn't have to suggest anything as the member of staff asked us to check back in an hour after contacting the cleaning team to see if we could have our room. I was given an information leaflet about all the weeks activities for children and adults alike which also gave the times of the restaurants opening times and the times of the free bus in to Albufeira.We had a superb lunch in the Real Cozinha Restaurant. This is also where you have breakfast and the buffet dinner. When we got in our room we were delighted with it, a sea view as requested, very clean and spacious enough for the 3 of us. The pool area was kept clean and thankfully for the kids the heated pool was warm as the unheated one was very cold! It was April after all. We didn't use the Spa as my kids were under the age limit. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Always greeted you with a smile.Fantastic location on a gorgeous beach, I recommend walking to/from Olhos De Agua along the beach at low tide. Just beautiful. We took advantage of the shuttle bus to Albufeira Old Town one day. Very easy drop off and pick up at the top of the escalator or at the strip if you wanted. Highly recommend this hotel.  We had a very relaxing stay in a quiet room"
Apr 2018,50,Excellent family stay,"We stayed at the Grande Real with our 6 year old daughter and all loved it. The staff were all so friendly, whether it be at reception, in the restaurant or the cleaners. From check in we were given a ride to our apartment in a golf buggy. It wasn't really necessary given we were only just across the car park but our daughter thought it was great fun.We had a 2 bedroom apartment which had everything we needed and was clean and well decorated and furnished. There were 2 bathrooms, a smaller one with a shower and larger one which also had a bath and shower. Beds were comfortable, our double bed was massive. There were tv's in both bedrooms which the 6 year old found a great novelty, they offer a range of English language channels including CBeebies and Cartoon Network for kids.Breakfast was a buffet with loads of choice; cooked items, pastries, cereals, porridge, pancakes and much more. A number of other reviews have commented on the queue to get in to the restaurant for breakfast, we ate before 9am each morning and there were always plenty of tables available but we did see queues between 9:30 and 10:30. The 6 year old did loudly comment that the queuing people were lazy and should have got out of bed earlier!We also had our evening meal at the hotel. Again this was a buffet with the choices changing each night. The food was very European and with plenty of seafood but if you want chips you're out of luck as there weren't any. This didn't bother us and even our fussy 6 year old found enough to her liking and even tried a few things she wouldn't normally touch at home. There were plenty of desserts though so that was always her favourite part of the meal.The hotel location on the beach is excellent with great views and although a little way out from the old town there is a free shuttle bus provided by the hotel through the day to the old town and strip. There are quite a few pools, none of the outdoor pools are heated and as it was early April they felt freezing, not that it out the 6 year old off. I imagine that in warmer weather they feel refreshing. If we return to Albufeira we'd definitely go back to the Grande Real."
Apr 2018,50,Lovely property. Great for families.,A gorgeous resort with a friendly top notch staff. The kids club was fantastic and we had an amazing and relaxing holiday. An absolutely perfect location overlooking a breathtaking beach. Would love to come back.
Apr 2018,50,Fantastic stay.,"Came here for a 5 night stay with a friend. The resort is beautiful. It has 3 indoor pools (1 is heated) plenty of space to get a deckchair outside. The beach is literally on your doorstep and then views are insane! We also had breakfast which was great & included everything you could want. The staff at this hotel go out of their way to help you & are so friendly so huge thumbs up. Especially to the lady on reception who was a “trainee”! The hotel is really close to both old and new town so great for day out, dinners or even for the bars/clubs. Only downside was the indoor spa centre. We paid to use the sauna, steam room and the therapeutic pool. Did not see value for money. Other than that we had a brilliant time!"
Apr 2018,30,Don’t be fooled...Not 5*,"Firstly, I’d like to say I and my family had a lovely holiday. But this hotel isn’t a 5* Hotel so if you go expecting that you will be disappointed, which is what I was. I believed it’s trip advisor star rating :-(The good points : •staff were friendly and helpful. On are arrival room was hot and stuffy, air condition didn’t seem to work. We rang reception and they sent someone up. Obviously it had be disabled to save money, so he had to do something in the ceiling area to turn it back on. Could not have slept if that hadn’t been addressed so pleased they sorted it.•Reception area clean, grand and impressive •Pool areas/garden lovely (not obviously in April the outdoor pool was freezing, having one of the hotels 7 outdoor pools heated might have been nice?) •bed turn down service nice, but necessary? Is that why they get 5*?The not so good:•queuing, yes queues to get into breakfast. Regularly going for breakfast at 9:30-9:40 (open till 10:30) we had to wait to be seated. On two occasions we saw people waiting at 10:30 to get into restaurant.•the very outdated bathroom, bath with over head hand held tap controlled shower.•being charged 4.50€ for a bottle of water for the room. Yes 5* and only got 1 bottle of complementary water on 10day holiday. Oh and no coffee making facility in room.•the unsafe looking, shabby put up bed for child in room. • stained chairs in room.•and well if go expecting a good kids club as you’d get with first choice, don’t. They tried, but our child went for 2hrs only coz she wanted to bounce on the bouncy castle and go on the Easter egg hunt. Don’t expect 5* and you’ll be fine."
Apr 2018,50,Lyla + Sean Ireland,Excellent resort for families and older couples.  Could not find any fault with this resort.  Staff in all departments very helpful and friendly.  Rooms cleaned daily with extra fresh towels etc.  Breakfast a real treat - looking forward to next visit.
Apr 2018,50,Wonderful Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff were so welcoming, our room was spacious, clean and we could see the sea from our balcony (without requesting). The views from the hotel are phenomenal, we really did not want to come home. We ate at three of the four restaurants and all were lovely. If I had any slight disappointment it would be the charge to use the indoor pool (we did not know this) and we would have liked tea and coffee in our room (considering it’s a five star). I would happily come again, the location is perfect and I’m already missing it. Thank you xx"
Apr 2018,40,5 star hotel with 4 star management,"The review pertains to our April 2018 stay at Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa. The hotel is placed in a fabulous location - on a cliff overseeing a gorgeous private beach. It has the amenities of a 5 star resort, however not a 4 star management of these facilities. An example is the restaurant where breakfast is served. The restaurant is way too small for the number of people it caters to and each morning people of all ages have to queue for 10-20mins outside the restaurant until a table become available (ridiculous!). The hotel does have the space to extend the breakfast area but for some reason (I feel is lack of interest on the management side) they keep things as they are. I raised the point with the restaurant manager and I was told ""you can take your options to the reception"" as it was none of his business or interest. It's really sad to see potential in this property but lack interest in developing this potential."
Apr 2018,40,Good Hotel and location,The stay in the hotel was very nice and very good location with access to the beach. The staff's were very  kind and  helpful. Our 1 bed room was spacious and clean. Free shuttle to the old town was really useful.
Apr 2018,40,Not a five star ,"This hotel needs a star review5* I would say 4*Few things you have to pay separately for the in door pool. 18 Euros which is a jokeIn a five star, it should be standard. There is a fish restaurant on the beachPlease don't waste your money, it's low key food with high prices and poor food."
Apr 2018,50,"Excellent hotel, lovely views, very good service","We enjoyed a few days at this hotel, it deserves the 5 star ranking, however the whole atmosphere is laid back. There is very little to say that is not positive. The hotel has an excellent beach, with easy access. All of the hotel staff were friendly, and efficient. The inclusive breakfast was also great, with many food options. The hotel management definitely go the extra mile for their guests. The hotel price was very competitive, despite being head and shoulders above the rest."
Apr 2018,40,Good hotel but not a 5 star ,"This is a lovely hotel with great service and amazing location. Probably one of the best in the proximity. There are , however a few points that can help to improve We had a double room overlooking the sea , the views were lovely and it was very nice and quite The extra bed provided for our daughter had a vey thin mattress , could not use itThe breakfast selection is lovely, nice fruits and pastries but had to purposefully ask for fresh omelette /eggs to be made ( not advertised) . All coffees are only from the machine. The most disappointing thing was that the indoor spa / pool is for adults only and costs 20 eur per day/visit. For a 5 star family hotel I would definitely expect an indoor pool with access for children Thank you"
Apr 2018,40,A grand fatther review,The sweet  swimming pool was really cold the first day. Other services are very good. No information about nearby touristic attactions. My little children enjoyed the breakfast a lot. The price for the dinner is too high for the quality of the food.
Apr 2018,50,Above and beyond ,"We visited as a family, the hotel was very quiet even though it was Easter. We were very lucky with the weather and even on the really warm days you could always get a sunbed. Drinks are over priced but it is a 5star hotel. Didn't eat at the hotel. Room cleaned every day and very spacious. On our last day, our daughter got a big splinter in her foot from the decking around the pool (be careful) we went to reception to ask for something to get it out. The manager and a security man promptly,  came to the room and assisted us. On our return to the room later in the evening, we were shocked to see a delivery of Wine, fruit and chocolate brownies as a way of an apology. This service was above and beyond what we expected."
Apr 2018,40,Perfect location,"I like more comfort in the lounge, the music was hard diner buffet was nog so goed for the privé you had to pay.. the swimmingpool and the bus around it was perfect. The rooms are everyday cleand and the people are very kindly."
Apr 2018,50,"Beautiful location, excellent service","Great location with plenty to do on site, free bus to town and lots within walking distance of the resort. Rooms were clean and spacious, excellent service at all times and plenty of food choice available."
Apr 2018,50,Great hotel,"We had a beautiful room on the 3rd floor, great sea view and a large balcony . The reception staff were very efficient and very nice. The hotel it’s self has everything you need to have a great holiday. We will definitely be back."
Apr 2018,40,Easter Holiday Apr 2018,"We have been going to this hotel with our daughter who is now 10 years old for seven years.  We always book a sea view suite on B&B basis.  This year however we were slightly disappointed.  The rooms now had wooden flooring which creaked continuously all day and all night and for the first time since we have been going there our daughter was up every night with the noise.   Little things have changed and although not major these were the things that have drawn us back year after year.  No pots of coffee in the morning anymore, it's out of a machine now (not the same unfortunately).  We usually always have a pot of coffee to the room first thing before breakfast.  This again was initially just two cups of machine coffee which we eventually managed to change to a pot with a pot of milk, however the size varied when we did have it some days a pot with no more than two cups in it and other days with a larger pot but all priced the same.  The staff have always been really friendly and helpful, seeing the same staff year after year which must be a good sign.  However quite a lot of new faces (which obviously happens) but some not particularly friendly or helpful.   No one to meet us to take bags when we arrived which is the first time this has happened.  I guess these are all pretty minor things but just not the service we have received every other time.  shame really as it tarnished our visit a wee bit, we always feels very at home and a huge wave of peace and tranquility when we arrive there.  Maybe time to look elsewhere, though I'm sure we'll end up back there at some point.....I hope"
Apr 2018,40,PROS and CONS,"A great hotel,but a little pricey.Plenty of sunbeds and 3 pools.Bus from hotel to town a bonus.Restaurants in hotel expensive.Better to go to Martins, left at main road outside hotel, a short walk.Better still a 4 euro taxi ride or 20 mins.walk to Adego do Ze.Turnright outside hotel.The local Portuguese frequent it.It is VERY reasonable.Enjoy!"
Apr 2018,50,Easter break,First time to Portugal with family. Wonderful place to stay and very close to sandy beach. Excellent rooms and big enough for a family of 4. Good room service and friendly front desk staffs. Will definitely recommend and visit again.
Apr 2018,50,Magical!,"If you can ignore the crime against design and architecture (think 90s Changing Rooms style) this is a magical hotel, on a gorgeous cove with spectacular views of the cliffs, private beach and sea. Service and staff are great. The room is large and clean, would benefit from having drinks in the mini bar and tea/coffee facilities. Breakfast buffet is really good. Lunch and dinner in same restaurant. There is also a gourmet burger restaurant. The fish restaurant is outstanding quality, well worth a visit. There are two swimming pools, outdoor bars, tennis courts, and a spa and gym. It appears to be popular with families. There is also a fish restaurant and bar in the beach. We are only here for a couple of days, but would happily spend a two week holiday here relaxing in comfort. We wouldn’t need to leave the hotel!"
Apr 2018,50,Wonderful hotel and staff,"We are just home yesterday from this hotel. It was our 2 nd visit and we’ve booked today to go again in June. The seaview rooms are brilliant and hotel so close to the beach you can hear the waves washing onto the sand.The staff could not be more pleasant and friendly,especially all staff at reception. Can’t wait for June"
Apr 2018,50,Superb staff.,Excellent hotel. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Food was excellent (stayed on half board.) Location was great. Walks down and along beach after breakfast pleasant.. Cleaning of rooms daily. Will definitely return.
Apr 2018,30,Let down but still ok,"Arrived at hotel, looking amazing walking into reception service was great staff pleasant, we found our room, all looking fine. Our balcony opens up to the front where coach's pull up so couldn't leave the door open to let fresh air in the room, the air conditioning unit didn't work in our room, handles broken off in the bathroom, the bedroom was cleaned everyday, the spa pool and sauna is €18 each to use, pools outside  are very very small. The bar next to the pool charges €9 tuna sandwich have deep pockets for this hotel if you want to enjoy it, and to eat in for dinner your looking at €30 each without drinks!! The location of this place is close to beach which has lovely soft sand. (Bring your own shade) location to shops is 15min walk or 2 min taxi €5 ride. New town reminds you of Blackpool and tourist shops and British bars, I'd say this hotel is a british 3 star with 4 star service."
Apr 2018,50,Best Hotel in Algarve!!!!,"I absolutely love this hotel, My husband and myself are coming here for number of years and every year it is amazing!!! Look forward going back every year!!!! This hotel I would recommend to anyone it’s the best hotel and has excellent management staff & facilities 💕💕"
Apr 2018,50,First Class!,"My Fiancee and I recently came to stay at your beautiful Resort as we are getting married here in October 28th 2018. We very much enjoyed our short stay and cannot wait to return in October! All the services, amenities, location, staff were very nice indeed and could not do enough for us during our stay. This recent stay has really have put our mind at ease as a fantastic choice for our wedding venue for ourselves our  friends, and family and truly cannot wait until our return in October. We really wait until our return in October. A big thank-you to Angela the manager who showed us around your beautiful resort  also.  Best wishes Dermot & Zarah!"
Apr 2018,50,Fortieth wedding anniversary,I have booking with you from 30th April to 4th May. Could we request room with view for fortieth wedding anniversary. Friends of ours stayed before and told us of your work nderful hotel. Looking forward to staying. Tried to message you via your website but unable to.Thanks Sheryl Phillips
Apr 2018,50,Wonderful family situation.,"The studio accommodation, with view over the soccer field and swimming pool, suited our family very well. The boys loved the bouncy house- kids club and meeting with other children. The beach and swimming pools were pristine. The whole environment was beautiful and elegant."
Apr 2018,50,Superb,"First time visiting and have to say we were blown away by the stunning vistas ,the hotel ,the hotel team ( every member of staff we encountered) the T2 apartment was perfect and we will be back. Five star but very family focussed."
Apr 2018,50,Easter Break,"Hotel has everything needed for a nice family break. Clean rooms, lovely pool and beach, great kids club, bus service to old town. Reception staff very helpful with luggage delivered to the apartment on arrival. The bar drinks can be expensive, but other than that, it was an amazing stay overall and we will be back."
Apr 2018,50,"Fab hotel, great staff","Just spent 7 days at this hotel and was really impressed with facilities, accommodation and service. Despite the relatively bad weather (rain and cold wind) it didn't spoil the holiday.  We had a few sunny days which improved as the week went on.  The hotel has a lovely spa and gym to pass away the time although the thalasso spa/indoor pool comes at a charge of €20 for 1.5hrs which I thought was a bit excessive as I was looking forward to using the indoor pool for a daily swim as the outdoor pools, whilst fantastic, are not quite as enticing when it is raining and cold. To start with let me tell you about our arrival at the hotel.  The check in at reception was very quick, around 10mins, the staff being more than pleasant and helpful.  A porter was waiting with our luggage to take us to the apartment via golf type buggy. On arrival he took our luggage inside and checked we had everything we needed.  I requested an iron and ironing board which was delivered within 15 minutes (at no extra charge, unlike some other hotels in the area.) The apartment contained everything needed for a self catering holiday, pots, pans, full dinner service, coffee machine kettle fridge, microwave, cooking rings etc, etc. We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis so didn't really take full advantage of the facilities.  The room was cleaned daily and towels, toiletries etc replenished or replaced as needed.  The bed was fantastic and both myself and my husband remarked on how comfortable it was, never stayed in a hotel that provided such a comfortable bed and pillows.  Towelling robes are also provided, although these were a little dated, they were very clean, as was the apartment.  We had a television in both the lounge and the bedroom and access to all english channels, a bonus if you have children with you and the weather is poor.Now for the food.  Breakfast was very good and something for everyone, however the hot food was the same every day, no variation but with the array of other foods on offer this wasn't a problem.  The champagne at breakfast was very welcome and many diners took advantage.  Only someone very picky would find fault with the food.  The hotel itself is very nice and has a great pool area.  There are also other pools set amongst the apartments so even in high season I would expect there to be plenty of space to sunbathe. The greatest bonus of all is that the hotel sits right on a beautiful beach and there is a very good cafe on the terrace above the beach.  As it was still out of season some facilities were not available but we will certainly return when the weather is warmer to take full advantage of the location and facilities.An added bonus is that the hotel runs a regular shuttle service to both the 'Strip' (new town) and Albufeira old town, this is via their own coach (not a minibus) so there is plenty of space for guests.To conclude I would say this is the best hotel we have stayed at in Portugal, the people are lovely so if you have never been give it a go. We will certainly return to the Grand Real Santa Eulalia."
Apr 2018,50,60th birthday celebration ,"Portugal beautiful people, beautiful scenery, fresh food, friendly people, went out of season if this is your cup of tea....empty beach attached to the resort .....excellent, we stayed in the two apartment equipped with every thing you would need to cook a decent meal"
Apr 2018,50,Pre Easter Break,"My wife and returned to Grande Real this year because we had such a lovely time last year. Once again we had a lovely time, with all that we enjoyed the previous year still in place. We have no real negatives again. The one thing we did notice though was the noise in the restaurant, which was uncomfortable. Now this may be because the previous year the weather was better, therefore more people ate outside, or maybe  there were many more people in the hotel this year, than last."
Mar 2018,40,Nice Apartments,"This is a very upscale resort.  We stayed for a month.  Did not use the restaurants as they were much more expense than the restaurants just outside the resort.  The service was good, the room clean.  Wifi was good.  Beds smelled of mildew.  You would think that a 5 star resort would have clean beds.  Felt pads under the chair legs would have stopped the noise of scraping chairs from surrounding units, which was annoying.  Staff was great:  front desk, instructors, etc."
Mar 2018,30,Good but not 5*,"We stayed here for 7 nights, accommodation is nice, location is beautiful and the hotels appearance is clean and good but the service is not 5*, the food choice is minimal - there was no child options other than pasta. House cleaning left our room door wide open all day after cleaning it and we constantly had to keep asking for information that should have been visible for guests."
Mar 2018,30,Grande Real Santa Eulalia,The resort was good. The only problem we had was that room was NOT a 5 star bedroom. Its a bit dated. Service from staff was good and reception was very good helping to solve some problems with paying highway tolls
Mar 2018,30,Mixed experience,"Can't fault this hotel for cleanliness and comfort in room. For a 5 star hotel there were minor irritations, like the request for a kettle in the room resulted in  towels being delivered, although small coffee sized cups were given to us in the bar, they would not let us  have the larger cups even though they were available there, our room cards failed to open the gate to the beach the second time we used it and the next day they would not let us access our room and needed resetting again. The main restaurant where breakfast and a buffet evening meal are served was overcrowded and very noisy although later in the season there are tables available outside, it was too cold for us to do this. The chairs in this restaurant need replacing or repainting. The breakfast was very good, the buffet evening meal awful. We used room service after that for our evening meal as the hotel is a bit too far to walk into town. The room service meals were very good and we found enough choice for the  3 meals we needed.The adult pool was very cold which was very disappointing, the children's pool was warmer though and plenty of children were using it, unlike the adult pool. Some people have moaned about the number of steps to the beach, we found 3 routes down with between 60 and 69 steps but with stretches of flat between so not a reason to be put off unless you have serious health problems"
Mar 2018,50,BERNIE & JIMMY ENJOYED THEIR STAY AT THE GRANDE REAL SANTA EULALIA RESORT & HOTEL SPA,"Excellent.  We will definitely be back.  We were staying in self catering accommodation, but used the hotel food facilities on a regular basis.  The location and ambience is one of the best we have experienced to date, especially the private entrance onto the  very secluded beach."
Mar 2018,40,2 week stay,My wife and I have found this resort to be very comfortable and relaxing. It’s a very large resort with many different types of rentals. We are on a long stay trip so will be here for two weeks. The grounds are very nice and the kitchenettes are comfortable. Everyone eats in the dining room and the food and selection has been very good. This only draw back is you have to bring an entry coupon for dinner every night. This needs to be updated. All the staff have been very nice but room linens are changed once a week. I think that could be at least twice a week. We would highly recommend this resort!
Mar 2018,40,Lovely beach front hotel,I have always wanted to stay at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Hotel and on the whole it did not disappoint me although the weather could have been kinder as had two days of torrential rain!  Our room had a sea view which was amazing but we were on the first floor so maybe second or third floors would have an even better view.The staff were on the whole were very efficient and some very friendly especially the main bar staff.We were surprised on our day of arrival with some champagne and small pastries for our anniversary which was a very lovely thing for the hotel to have done for us and very much appreciated.The breakfast was excellent and there was a great choice of food and drinks and the waiting staff were very good at clearing the tables.  I only have two slight negatives.  The food in the main restaurant for dinner had not much in the way of variety and for me the desserts always saved my meal!  The dinners (and many other diners I spoke to said the same) were lukewarm so maybe the heating plates need to be looked at to keep the food hotter or install a microwave maybe? If you go self catering then that may be the better option.The other negative is the main bar doesn't feel like a bar!  You feel as if you are in a corridor and there is no atmosphere!  I guess this improves once the season is in full swing.If these slight negatives were addressed I would not hesitate in giving the hotel a score of 10 out of 10.  Cannot fault the setting of the hotel though and it looks amazing in the sunshine!  Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
Mar 2018,50,REal and GRande,PErfect locatiosn  PErfect service PErfect Beach Perfect food  PEtfect Stuff   all in all  REal Grande HOtel Beautiful complex with a lot of free parking places  Breakfast more than perfect highly recommnded
Mar 2018,50,Lovely Hotel,"Last minute booking of single bed apartment direct with central reservations. Internet site really easy to use. Accomodation and facilities within the apartment were excellent. Location just outside Albufiera but free hotel bus into town was great. Peaceful and relaxing break despite weather not being great. Hotel food limited and expensive but for self catering, supermarket only 10 mins away and everything could need in the kitchen, except an oven, made eating in very easy. Booking to return in 6 weeks when weather should be better"
Mar 2018,50,Never fails to please,Stayed again for the 2nd time in 3 weeks can't stay away from this hotel best position  than any around staff are excellant from the reception through to the cleaners and of cause the general manager can't do enough to please you make you feel like a friend coming back home just can't wait to come avain
Mar 2018,50,Amazing 5 star hotel,Great hotel right on the beach has everything you could possibly want self catering accommodation is brilliant hotel staff superb quiet comfortable rooms always friendly and helpful staff and spoke very good English.
Mar 2018,50,"Great stay, good price. will return","Just returned from Portugal and stayed for a week in the Grande Real Santa Eulália Resort & Hotel SPAFirst: We stayed in the hotel during early March.. the off season so hotel was not packed. Everything was as we expected when we arrived .. however it rained every day .But with this in mind the Hotel experience did not let us down one bit.The Service was top notch, all employees speaking english was a bonus , all our requested were promptly addressed. Second ; the pricing was great value for a 4 - 5 star hotel.. breakfast was very good even cooking me my favorite omlete every morning .. no surprise charges at all .Third : management sent a nice bottle of wine and fruit platter when we arrive to celebrate my wifes' 60th birthday .. nice touch.Forth : I read that the beds could be a bit hard so requested the mattress cover to soften them up a bit ,,, and bingo the beds were perfect.. TV had various channels in english , wifi was spot on .. and our room on the second floor JR suite.. overlooking the sea was very spacious and had a great veiw of the ocean. The large washroom and large tub was greatly appreciated.Finaly : I am sure the pool and grounds would have been just as spectacular if we had visited in warmer weather...The pictures on line show the hotel just the way it is .. no photo shopping that i could see ,,Overall I would be happy to revisit this hotel any time of year...steve / Canada"
Mar 2018,40,Scottish Dancing weekend,Just spent the weekend at the hotel for the annual Iberian Scottish dancing weekend.  All the staff in the main restaurant were friendly and were very helpful when I asked what the Gluten Free options were.  I was delighted with my apartment as it had great self catering facilities.
Mar 2018,30,Scottish Country Dance Iberian Weekend March 16 -18 2018,"We were a large Scottish Country Dance group. My room was 557 which was far away (350 metres)from the hotel and the rest of the group. The logistics for dinner in the main restaurant could not deal with over 100 people arriving at the same time. It took nearly 30 minutes to get each course. It inconvenienced the other residents who had to wait a long time to get a table. I had stomach problem after eating dinner one night. If you are having a large group to stay they should be accommodated together so that they can socialise and eat together at larger tables. (the tables were for 2 or 4 people) the Maitre d was very unwilling to make up a larger table, although this just meant a number of tables being pushed together. The enjoyment of the guests seemed to be a lot less important than the convenience of the staff. The arrangement of the food in the buffet was strange. The queue started at the desserts then cold food then hot food then more cold food then soup. It is my view that if a local Portuguese restaurant served the food we received, it would go out of business very soon."

Mar 2018,50,Relaxing,"Haven’t a bad word to say about the hotel itself. It was my wife’s 50th birthday whist we were there and the hotel organised to be brought to our room, a cake with candle and a bottle of champagne. But I think the spa is a tad over priced. And doesn’t cater for those that aren’t confident in water."
Mar 2018,50,Excellent hotel,"Really enjoyed our week fabulous location on the beach, excellent facilities and very friendly helpful staff despite unseasonably cold weather.  The bedroom and bathroom was very spacious. Helped us book trips and advised where to go."
Mar 2018,50,Great experience ,"We have just finished a four week holiday here for 4th consecutive year. We love it. The apartment is clean,well stocked. All staff are professional,helpful,friendly. The entertainment in the evening is a real treat. The location is excellent for walking ,hiking . There are many restaurants close by...in addition to the ones located in hotel. Spa is excellent."
Mar 2018,50,Birthday,"I stay 4 night in this amazing hotel ,everythings was allright.the room with seevieuw was very nice and confortable.the top was  the day of my birthday ,i received from the direction a cake with candel  and a bottle of brut.It was really fantastic.Thank very much at all"
Mar 2018,50,This resort goes FAR beyond multiple amenities and incredible accommodations and staff,"We are staying here for the second time and are enjoying our 7 week annual holiday in an establishment that has the BEST of staff in all areas of this terrific hotel.  That includes management, reception, housekeeping, and all service staff.More so, when I became very ill shortly after our arrival and required an ambulance late one night (insulin shock), my travelling companion called reception and explained the seriousness of my condition.  Within minutes, a gentleman arrived with a medical  bag and stayed by my side until the ambulance arrived . Several bags of sucrose were administered and once my blood sugar went up above 4, I was taken to the emergency clinic and treated immediately by a crew of very competent nurses and a terrific doctor.  While most of the occurrences were  somewhat blurry, I knew that it was thanks to the staff at the Grande Real , the ambulance and the hospital that I came through this terrifying experience.  The next day, I received a beautiful basket of fruit and mineral water from a manager who promised to keep in touch to oversee my progress.  How does one thank these incredible individuals????Lastly, would you believe they sent a birthday card, a delicious cake and a bottle of ""vin mousseux"" for my friend's birthday.  I would NEVER consider any other hotel when I  am in the Algarve..  Thank you Grande Real!!!!"
Mar 2018,50,Another Visit to these lovely apartments,"Hi GuysMy wife and myself along with two friends booked into these apartments from 6th February 2018 for 10 days,all booked through jet2.once again jet 2 were great,we think the jet2 staff are just lovely,always helpful and with a nice smile.We booked private transfers with jet 2 again no problems,straight off the plane straight into a people carrier.We arrived at the reception and were booked into our apartments very quickly we had apartment 591 our friends were right next door.They take you to your apartment on a golf buggy saves you humping your cases around,,great touch we think.The apartments are very clean nice and fresh and bright,kettle,fridge,cups and everything you need,,wine glasses etc.We loved just sitting outside our apartments just chilling in the sun with some nice wine and snacks.It was out of season visit for us again so the place is very quiet,lovely grounds and pools but a bit chilly for a dip,the main hotel has a nice bar with entertainment some nights also a great beach bar for morning breakfast or lunch and drinks,just watching the sea.Great beach we enjoyed the walking along it.We walked into Albufeira most morning for breakfast at Rita's plaice,they do nice fish and chips as well hence the name.We also found nice quiet bar snooker just out the hotel gates turn right,cross road walk a bit its on the right side of the road we called it 1 Euro bar,cos wine was 1 Euro a glass.Also handy little supermarket out side hotel gates turn right,cross the road just passed gas tank,,we used the gas tank steps,bit of a short cut.Yes we all enjoyed our stay and will be heading back for maybe a longer stay,,miss our winter months.hope we have been helpful,,all the best the GeordiesOh be careful of Paradise tours not very good."
Mar 2018,50,Amazing stay during stormy weather,"We returned last week from Faro after a week stay at the resort. We went with our 2 year old and it was our first time in Portugal. The weather was not good due to storm emma and it rained a lot. The first apartment we were given had a faulty aircon, which meant we had to move to another one next morning. The second apartment (425) had the same issue with the aircon not heating the bedroom, but we had to manage as it was not an option to move again with our little one. The bedroom was getting really cold at night and did cause a bit of discomfort to our baby. The apartments were a little outdated, but they were clean. The cleaning lady who cleaned our apartment during the week was amazing. Whenever she saw something missing in the apartment, she would bring it over without us asking for me. Very sensible. The apartment was very nicely cleaned everyday and it helped us to make the most of the holiday rather than worrying about cleaning.The resort is just next to the beach and has amazing sea views. There are round 4 restaurants, not sure if they all belong to the resort, but all of them provide amazing sea views which we enjoyed during lunch. The food was average here.Staff at the hotel were very friendly, polite and more than happy to help. The resort is around 15mins away from the Albufeira old town. We did not try the food at the hotel so cannot comment. There is an Italian restaurant just outside the resort and they do takeaway. There two more restaurants which one can find via google. The closest supermarket is Favorite (around 15mins walk) or InterMarche which is around 25mins towards Albufeira old town. Zoomarine is around 20mins and taxi would cost around Eur 18. Another place we visited on our last day was KrazyWorld which is around 35mins from the hotel and the taxi came to around Eur 24.The resort has good wifi connection, which did help on occasions when the weather was not good. They also had Cbeebies tv channel which kept our little one entertained. There is also an indoor childern's play house. We visited it couple of times and it has quite a good selection of toys. One of the things which we did not like about the resort was the breakfast. While booking the resort, the price of the breakfast was given as Eur 15 with an option only to pay at hotel. While checking in we were offered Eur 12.50 only if we decide to choose it for the whole stay and if we did not decide there and then, the breakfast would be Eur 20 a day. So for a couple staying for 10 days would roughly spend Eur 400 only on breakfast, which sounds over the top. Not worth if one would only have a croissant and a coffee.Another thing we discovered is, the booking site said indoor pool, but there is none. The one which is present in the hotel is part of Spa and the charge is Eur 18 for 90mins usage. All the other pools are outdoors, but some of them are heated. All in all our stay at the resort was good. We would have enjoyed if the weather had been better, but cannot fault the resort for that. We will certainly choose the resort if we visit Portugal again."
Mar 2018,50,holiday,great hotel and would recommend it to everybody  very comfortable and the staff very friendly and helpful. everything that you need for a great holiday cant wait to return. all bars and restaurants have great services and  great  variety . also the spa area was lovely and  for travelers with young children the kids club would be a great rest bite for them. also the many swimming pools was great and the beach so close was great
Mar 2018,50,Excellent Portugal Experience!,"Overall, my first visit to Portugal was amazing. The Grand Real Santa Eulália is in a great location, close to town thanks to the hotel bus service & central to markets & cafés. The staff was attentive,  prompt & most accommodating. The units were quite adequate and comfortable. I would certainly recommend this hotel to friends & family."
Mar 2018,50,2018 Vacation,Had a very good time at this resort. Location was excellent as city buses and tour buses stopped outside the resort gate. Added value was the resort shuttle which ran several times daily to and from Albufeira. The resort fronts the beach for a great way to stretch your legs. Cappuccinos on the Atlantico terrace in the morning and gelatos  in the afternoon. Very good.
Mar 2018,50,Anne,"Beautiful hotel in lovely location, staff couldn’t be more helpful from reception to cleaners. The whole resort is well kept. Great variety of food to suit everyone. The courtesy bus is an added bonus."
Mar 2018,50,Amazing return stay,"We have stayed here three times previously and would not hesitate to return again. Everything and everyone at the resort are amazing. The staff and Resort really are 5 star. The rooms are clean and well presented. We had a sea view room and the outlook was great, it was sheltered and great to sit out on of an evening on the balcony. Breakfasts are truly good."
Mar 2018,20,"Family with young toddler,out of seasons point of view","SUMMARY:- Nice hotel with great views, but not very entertaining for kids (evening at least)and your money wont go very farThe hotel is in a fantastic location looking down on the beach! The beach bar is a great place to chill out! The hotel and rooms are very clean, with our rooms and towels changed daily if you wish! Our balcony came in very handy for entertaining our 16month old son!  The rooms do not have tea making facilities but can be bought for €3 In reception! They have a safe and a fridge The buffet breakfast has plenty to choose from although the fried breakfast is very disappointing! We arrived early for breakfast each day where we found the beans sometimes to be hard and cold, the fried eggs and hash browns were also cold!  On the third day,I gave up on the cooked and stuck to continental options! (Which were very nice)The staff in the hall are polite and collect plates as soon as they become empty! Hot drinks,juice and water are available free of chargeThe hotel has a kids play area(which are son loved), open most of the day accept 1-2! The staff here are happy smiley people who interact well with the kids! They preferred to tidy the toys up after we left rather than us sorting them as we went and were happy for us to borrow buckets and spades for the beach! There are plenty of toys and a tv with computer along with a good secure park! There are plenty of places to eat at the hotel but it is quality over quantity! We bought a milk shake, a beer and 2 burgers which cost €36!(tasty and looked good)We asked about the buffet option on a thundery evening, bearing in mind our cold breakfast,I wasn't prepared to chance paying €30 per person for the same in the evening! We chose to go out the rest of the time and get more for our money!(spoiled for choice in the 2 towns and strip)The gym has everything you need and is available all day,towels for during exercise and showers,along with lockers are available free of charge!  (Being an ex rugby player it didn't bother me,but neither of the individual shower cubicals are lockable in the men's room!)The hotels pools were dissapointing too, the outdoor pools are supposedly heated to 27° but felt far from this and too cold for our son,the internal pool caters for 7> and is charged at €20 an hr!(caps must be warn) It is currently out of season so obviously you expect reduced entertainment, that said, other than the children's play area and activities,there was no kids entertainment available for the evening!   The hotel provides a bus service to the old town and the new town! Even out of season, the service is well used! It would be good if there were more buses in the afternoon,but this may change in the summerOut of season at least, I would say this hotel was better suited for adults only"
Mar 2018,30,5stars,I have been at this hotel  7 days and  I cannot see how this hotel gained 5stars the food most night are either stew or cooked in garlic there was no choice if you didn’t like stew or garlic .most nights I only had a cheese roll this the first hotel where I had to buy my water for the table for my evening meal
Mar 2018,50,Cannot Fault At All,"Mostly 5 out of 5 really cant find a fault. Location mile or so from the old town but restaurants and bars nearby. Stayed in apartment very pleased with quality. Breakfast superb with vast selection of different foods, drinks."
Mar 2018,50,Beautiful Place,"It’s a beautiful place I would definitely go again. Went end of feb so it was less busy. Staff are very helpful, the free shuttle bus into the old and new city makes travel easier if you are not driving. The only thing I would have liked was coffee facilities and a pair of slippers in the room. I wish a had paid a few more £s for a room with a sea view. Restaurants, bars, swimming pools ++ ."
Mar 2018,40,Really grand hotel,"We booked for self catering but found no sea views that were stated by booking site. Hotel was very accommodating and found us a room in main building which overlooked the beach and we were not disappointed. Lovely room but a rather forgetful maid who would clean room and remove bathroom items and not replace them. It became a game in the end and we regularly checked the room on return and had a good laugh. Overall, a very lovely stay in beautiful surroundings. Main restaurant had wide selection of food for all tastes and the staff were very amicable and efficient. Worthy of praise. It would have been a touch more pleasant if we didn't have rain most of the week but car hire helped fill the time to visit old haunts."
Mar 2018,50,Grand it is ...,"Upon arrival you are treated to beautiful gated entrance, very private and inviting. The reception area is very open with gleaming floors and staircase. Checking in was a breeze, many staff available , and super friendly. Our booking included breakfast, and sea view room, but was located below the lobby because it is built on a hillside. Super large room with wall to wall patio doors, with large bathroom with bidet. Remember that is is located on the outskirts of the new town Albufeira , so getting to the new town commercial area is a 15 minute walk , and walking to the old town will require about 45 minutes walking. The hotel provides a shuttle 5 times daily with stops along the route , so bring shopping bags if you wish to pick up goodies for your room. The front desk will help you with everything you need. They were wonderful and knowledgeable. They suggested car rental company , provided parking free of charge, and our car was delivered at the door and left there upon end of our contract.We chose ""local car"" company, paid for 3 days and got 2 free days , all insurance in it cost $120 euros for a VW Polo.Daily breakfast was the one of the better ones we have had during our many trips. Specialty cheeses, fresh fruit, pastries, and your standard fare. The eating area is big with views of the ocean, surrounded with outside eating areas if you wish to consume in open air.The beach area is relativity small but rock abutments abound to make it picturesque. Access is through gated doors with many steps to reach the beach . The gates open with your room key so remember to bring it with you. You will find a café on your way to the beach after you cross the gates.The restaurants in the hotel are on the expensive side, but a short walk to your left at the entrance will bring you to many restaurants. We tried many with the tourist menu , meaning that you get a 3 course meal with choice of beverages for around $25 euros per couple. Our favourites were Ribeiro, Paulu's, Raina for ribs, but really they are all good, and very affordable. Service was excellent and friendly. Communicating in English was no problem. It is rated 5 stars and it is ...!"
Mar 2018,40,not a 5 star hotel,"Nice hotel in very good location. Very good service and a lot of space in lobby, also nice bar but is all very nice. As for 5 star should never be :- empty minibar- 20 euro for using swimming pool !!- avarage quality food for dinner- plastic cups in room- not tea and caffe in room- not in every bar you can charge to room- for towel to pook you must go 1 floor up to take it from reception- can't go to indoor pool with kids"
Mar 2018,50,Amazing Location,"From the coach turning into the fates of the complex I knew this was going to be a great holiday. Quick and efficient check in. Very good room, but not sea facing, but this wasn’t an issue. Amazing views from hotel terrace. All areas very clean and tidy. Great choice at breakfast including Buck’s Fizz. Good quality food. Easy walk to local shops and restaurants and a free shuttle bus to The Strip and Old Town."
Mar 2018,40,Relaxing break....,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Good location. Picturesque.We had excellent weather. Good walks if tide is out and have suitable footwear. Able to walk from old town having taken hotel bus to Old tow . Good suite with views of pool and sea. Would recommend asking for a sunny room in February. Ours was in the shade PM  but only there for 4 nights so not worth complaining. Breakfast was good, though cooked was lukewarm so had fresh fruits Etc. Lovely cava for celebratory breakfasts too! We were attacked by 2 German shepherds on the beach in front of the hotel on our last day. Spent 6.5 hours in A and E on return, on antibiotics and had a tetanus! We hope this is an extraordinary occurrence in this area. The hotel staff were as shocked as us so can't be normal!?! No feedback as yet if the dogs were captured! Please beware of dogs in this area. A frightful experience."
Mar 2018,50,Fabulous hotel,"We have been visiting this hotel in February for the last 5 years and would highly recommend it. The hotel is fabulous in a perfect location The staff are all very friendly, welcoming and professional."
Mar 2018,40,Very nice hotel and facilities.,Visited the hotel for a 4 night trip between 27th Feb and 3rd March. The hotel is very nice and spacious and the rooms were very clean and tidy and beds were big! Hotel is in a good location with free shuttle service which takes you to the new town and old town.Buffet breakfast was very nice with a lot of variety and offered gluten free bread and cakes for breakfast! Hotel restaurant also had the option of providing burgers on gluten free bread. Hotel staff very helpful and friendly would definitely stay here again should we visit Albufiera. Only downside - No kettle and tea making facilities in the room and did not offer late checkout on final day as our shuttle back to airport was at 2pm so had to wait in lobby for 2 hours.
Mar 2018,50,Ticks all the boxes,"This is a great hotel - right on the beach, has everything you could possibly want from conference venues, massive meeting rooms, hotel rooms, self catering accommodation - everything.We stayed in a self-catering flat just behind the main hotel.  Was really nice.  Bedroom (king bed), bathroom, and open plan lounge dinning-room and kitchen.  Was big and there was a fold out bed in the lounge which I slept on and was perfect - very comfy.The hotel staff were superb.  My suitcase didn't arrive (got stuck in Lisbon).  They followed up for me, made sure it got delivered to the hotel and brought it right to my room.  They even helped out with toiletries while I waited for my bag to arrive."
Feb 2018,50,A &B,"Great location and facilities,staff very attentive and professional. Bedrooms spacious and serviced daily.The disappointment was the restaurant next to the lobby bar only had Burgers on the evening menu ,not good for a 5 star hotel.However overall an excellent hotel ,with superb standards."
Feb 2018,40,"Beautiful property, great food","We had a one bedroom apartment for 3 nights with a huge lovely patio and fully equiped kitchen, however, we decided not to cook during our time at the resort. We paid extra for breakfast & dinner meal plan and so very pleased we did. This was the best eating we enjoyed during our two weeks in Portugal. The buffets were excellent!We loved the resort views and out-door upper-level seating to relax and enjoy the beautiful beach and sunshine.The hotel is tucked away and not really close to anything.  It is approximately a 1 hour walk to the Old Town.  They do provide free daily buses from the resort on weekdays, however, we like to walk so opted to walk instead.  We also took advantage of the on-site gym.Overall a very enjoyable 3 days of bliss in a beautiful resort."
Feb 2018,40,Lovely hotel with a great beach and lots of pool options.,"Good food at the hotel, lovely lodges which all seem to have access to at least one pool. The beach is fantastic. Didn't get a chance to check out the spa facilities. Would happily return with family."
Feb 2018,50,Third visit to hotel,"3rd visit here. Lovely hotel, spotlessly clean, very relaxed great location p, easy walk to sunning beach, will be back next year. Rooms big, room 303. Superb view over bay, also has disabled access which was good for hubby. Food good, reception staff very helpful"
Feb 2018,50,Brilliant Hotel,5 day family stay - 2 adults and 3 teenagers. Fabulous hotel and self catering apartments. We stayed in a self catering apartment opposite the hotel and it was to a very high standard. It was cleaned daily and had a very good air-con system. It was my wife's birthday on the Friday and my twins on the Saturday. Hotel management and staff recognised both and sent champagne and cake to our apartment. Staff very helpful and friendly and the hotel facilities are excellent. We ate in both the main restaurant and the gourmet burger restaurant with the food in both very good. Other shops and restaurants only 10 mins walk away. Definitely will return
Feb 2018,50,Lovely hotel and facilities,"Stayed here for 7 nights with my close family. It was a wonderful experience -- two swimming pools, location adjacent to the beach, nightly entertainment and smartly decorated rooms. The highlight was the quality of the nightly buffet -- I never knew that the words ""quality"" and ""buffet"" could go together until I stayed at this hotel!"
Feb 2018,40,Pleasant hotel,This hotel is right on a beach outside Albefuira. There are lovely terraces and seating areas outsideThe lobby has comfortable sofas and seating areas There's a free shuttle bus into Albefuira that stops in a handy place in the old town at the sea front where there are great cafes and restaurants....lobster prawns sea bass etcUp the hill I found a shop with leather  shoes/bags.  I'm very pleased with my purchasesFor a supermarket at this time of year Leave the hotel and turn right when you reach the public road. About 7mn walk. Smaller nearer ones are closed right now. There's a good local restaurant about 5 mn last the supermarket on the right side Turn left on the public road to walk to Albefuira new town..About 15mn. I'd recommend taking the shuttle bus as the new town is very spread outStaff at the hotel are very helpful and efficient
Feb 2018,50,Great Spot for Company Events,"My company stayed here for our annual retreat. I'd definitely stay again and recommend it. My only complaint was the tub water would drain properly in my bathroom. From the moment I turned on the shower it filled up and took forever to go down. I tried to explain it to the staff cleaning person, but I wasn't able to explain it well since I don't speak Portuguese. But they cleaned the tub everyday, so it wasn't a huge deal. Great services and clean rooms."
Feb 2018,50,Great resort with kids fun,"We spent 10 days in this resort , hat a family apartment which was big enough. Especially the kids club was great, with swimming classes, our son started diving and fun shows in the evening. Food was great and more than enough-"
Feb 2018,30,january stay,"Try to avoid the level ""-2"" rooms they are ground level but they are near to the noisy areas. Avoid room 7 too as its bathroom smells - not fixed during our stay despite several reminders. VG breakfast with lots to choose from."
Feb 2018,50,Pearl of Albufeira,"The hotel was recommended to us and we were not disappointed. It was love for the first site. Fantastic location, beautiful panoramic view, friendly atmosphere, very kind and helpful staff. They were smiling from their heart. I could highly recommend them to relax there and enjoy the best of  Algarve."
Feb 2018,30,"Great hotel,if you love children ","We have spent  a week from our summer vacation there, and we booked a suite much earlier to safe costs. We stayed in 2BR facility, with sea view, with 2bathrooms which was v nice. Room was clean, well maintained, but there was an unpleasant smell from the bathroom several times, which appeared bit imperfect. The property is quite large, directly at the beach, but this is public beach, hotel offers no booking options for sun beds. These can be rented at 20€ per day per 2, otherwise you can lay on the sand. The beach was very crowded, there is only one restaurant. The pool area at the hotel is pretty big but in high season it is not easy to find a good spot. Breakfast was not too bad but if you come later than 8:45 you will queue to be seated and there will be lots of families with small kids.the same is true for the main pools although the hotel has separate facilities for families with children.  Also be aware that everyone can enter the Hotel premises and stay athe pool. There are several decent and inexpensive restaurants in walking distance for dinner and few for lunch, and few supermarkets.  Overall pretty good hotel provided you don’t mind crowded beach, pool area and children playing loud and running around. We would probably not return."
Jan 2018,50,Great value for money,"We booked hotel to be near with some friends. Value for money was excellent. The beds are huge but a bit hard. And the rooms were large, so large that the TV looked small. Would be an improvement if the TV would be higher on the wall in stead of standing on desk. For the rest: great hotel. Must be fun in summer too."
Jan 2018,50,Great January break,"We stayed as a family of four in two adjoining sea view suites in January. We have been travelling to Portugal for many years and we have stayed at the Grande Real before due to its great location to the beach, the superb views, and the wonderful team of staff that work tirelessly to ensure you have a great stay.We are returning again in March for 5 nights and will no doubt be booking again in the future!"
Jan 2018,40,Beautiful Hotel with firendly staff,"We really enjoyed our stay in room 230 of your hotel. Nice room, friendly staff, nice food......very relaxing. It gives you the feel of luxury. Only one downside: the beds were terrible!! Wooden boxes with mattrasses.......they squeak and creak with every movement you make. Hopefully they'll put new, modern (box-spring) beds in every room!!"
Jan 2018,50,Bliss,"Wonderful cuisine, friendly staff. Large room and veranda with fabulous view. Right above a lovely beach. Many local bars/restaurants closed for winter off-season, hotel breakfast buffet excellent especially the gorgeous slices of local oranges. Temperatures were like good British summer days, ideal for us. In the pool and sunning in January, not mad busy with people, what more could you want? Would love to go again."
Jan 2018,50,Great Hotel ***,"Beautiful hotel, been here three times already and will definitely be back.  The breakfast is superb, the lay out of the hotel connected to the beach is fantastic.  I would recommend this hotel to couples and families alike."
Jan 2018,50,Great hotel in fantastic location,"Really nice hotel. Spacious room and bathroom. The staff were fantastic - efficient, friendly, helpful. The location is great for a beach holiday - it's set on a really beautiful beach and also has swimming pools. There was a charge for use of the jacuzzi in the spa but the outdoor pools were available. The breakfasts were amazing - excellent choice buffet with lovely fresh foods; I would highly recommend including breakfast when booking the room because it was so good. We also ate in the hotel 1 night - a buffet which we were a bit disappointed with choice-wise, but what we ate was nice and the service was, as usual, fantastic. We also had room service 1 night which was very good - prompt service and piping hot food. If I had to mention anything I didn't like it was the enormous bed which we found slightly too firm - but we still slept well. We plan to visit Portugal again and I would definitely stay here."
Jan 2018,50,I loved this hotel.  ,"The hotel, the staff, the breakfast, the room was just perfect.The view from our room to the Beach was just stunning.Easy walk into town and staff just cannot do enough to help.Went on a caves and coastline tour.I'll be back for more 💜"
Jan 2018,50,Pleasant Experience,"The best and most enjoyable holiday I had for a long time. There was a small leak coming from ceiling in our apartment and we got an upgrade to bigger place,which we did not expect.,also complimentary breakfast & spa it made us feel special. Will be back again in June."
Jan 2018,40,Good value 4 night break,"Spent 4 nights here.  On arrival we were greeted warmly by receptionist and escorted by porter  to our apartment, this was very much appreciated by us as it was dark. It was warm and inviting on a cold December evening.  The apartment was spacious, very clean, and more cooking facilities than I had ever seen in a holiday hotel apartment.  Housekeeping was good - maid came every morning and thoroughly cleaned it.There was a courtesy bus service running to old and new town, which we used every day.  The hotel allowed us to stay on in the apartment on our final day, until 3.00pm with no extra charge, which was wonderful.  The only down side was the hotel location was just a wee bit too far out of the town, for us, the bus did not run in the evenings.  The hotel, while having live music most nights, had very few guests listening.   However our overall experience of it was good and certainly great value for the amount we paid."
Jan 2018,50,Excellent hotel with breathtaking views!,"I visited this resort Dec. 28 thru Jan 01, 2018 with my family (6 of us) and we were enchanted by this hotel and the Albuferia area. The hotel staff were very kind and caring and took the time to explain things to us as we needed. The buffet breakfast had something for everyone and was a great way to start the day. The views were beautiful and the sunbathing was comfortable and soothing with the sound of the waves crashing at the shore below. My adult children enjoyed the gym and hiking along the beach every day and  the trip into town was short where bars and restaurants were plentiful. We will definately plan a return trip to this wonderful resort!"
Jan 2018,40,Lovely hotel,We stayed in room 305 as b&b. Fantastic huge room overlooking sea. Large balcony. Comfortable enormous bed and large bathroom. Cleaned every day with fresh towels and bed linen. We did however ask the maids to leave cleaning for 1 or 2 days as didn't need it. Only downside with this room was there wasn't tea & coffee facilities in room. Bit of a let down. There is a mini fridge and safe. My advice is to take a travel kettle as there is a supermarket 10 mins walk away. Breakfast is buffet style and was excellent. A wide variety. Staff in restaurant excellent. Staff in bar grumpy and we had to jump up and down to get noticed and served. Fantastic pools and plenty of sun loungers. Front desk couldn't do enough for you. Credit to the hotel. Good gym and spa facilities. Loved the hotel although quite a walk to bars etc. Taxi to new town 6 euros and to old town 7 euros.
Jan 2018,50,Visiting on 19th jan,"Im due to visit albuferia on 19th jan there is going tp be 6 of us just seeing what bars e.t.c are still open were there 4 nights, were not too fussed about the weather but wanted to see if there is still a few and bars and that open to have a good old drink!!!????"
Jan 2018,30,This is not a 5* service,"Almost 1 hour waiting in a line for breakfast! ImpossiblePoor maintenance mainly in our bathroom were it was almost impossible to have a shower as the shower wasn't directing water correctly and was always moving. SPA personal very unfriendly, not polite and gave mixed information about the unacceptable cost to use the jets pool (20€ for arround one hour), never seen in any other 5* resort around the world. SPA area should also be better maintained and cleaned as the water line was thoroughly visible."
Jan 2018,50,Excellent stay again,"its rare that a hotel can keep up the standards it has set when it started, but this hotel has managed to do exactly that. polite staff, fantastic facilities. ideal for families and couples. never seen a hotel where the housekeeping cleans the guests dirty plates, pots and pans as well. keep it up guys."
Dec 2017,40,Christmas Holiday ,"Solo TravelHotel in quite location about 15 minuets walk to the new town but hotel runs a free shuttle service Tuesday to Friday, hotel complex rooms and amenities are 5 star but the staff are shocking really bad manners not one bit friendly I asked the receptionist to order me a taxi on one evening and he TUTTED at me , cleaning staff asked me to leave room so they could clean not one bit polite or friendly a huge let down to the hotel. The beach is right in front of the hotel really private and a nice relaxing walk I would recommend. Rooms are massive nice king bed tv and big bathroom no iron or tea making facilities which is a let down. PS the chocolates left on pillows are a nice touch."
Dec 2017,50,Best Holiday Place,"Delicious Meals, Nice apartments, restaurants, bars and friendly staff. I would recommend this place for a family holiday. Good relaxing place for whole family. Kids entertainment on point. Looking forward to visit again."
Dec 2017,50,Christmas getaway resort,We are a family of four and we’re looking to get away for Christmas. A holiday rep recommended this hotel for our stay when we mentioned we were considering Portugal.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and even our kids (11 year old girl and a 9 year old boy) who are normally very fussy and picky had nothing to complain about.Will visit again soon.Many thanks to all the staff who made our stay a pleasant experience.
Dec 2017,30,good for older adults and people love to be quiet.,"Perfect room, view, location (In terms of scenes). Food and stuff are very nice, especially kids club staff really good, second to none so far to my experience. But night entertainment was nightmare. Guitarist after guitarist, boring! Really put us off,  night life in the hotel is 0 for kids or adults. Not good for young families. But love everything else. No mini disco or night entertainment no coming back. Sorry."
Dec 2017,40,christmas stay at grande hotel santa eulalia,excellent value for money sometimes food in restaurant could have been a bit hotter and wifi was unavailable   in bedroom otherwise excellent value for money.hotel staff in all areas could not have been more pleasant and helpful
Dec 2017,30,Christmas break,The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. There didn’t seem to be much ambience about the hotel. We stayed half board and personally found the evening buffet to be repetitive and the food luke warm. The room was clean and the bed huge. We didn’t class this as a 5* hotel
Dec 2017,40,christmas in grande real,"good hotel . spacious . a little expensive for drinks . food could be better . setting was really good ...success to a lovely beach . staff are  good and friendly . clean rooms but standard room is basic for 5 star hotel.,"
Dec 2017,50,Wonderful family Christmas,"Lovely Christmas vacation.  Beautiful location, great kids club, staff friendly, good value overall. Lots of local restaurants within 15 mins walk of hotel.  We didn't eat dinner at hotel but Xmas lunch was very good.Lovely spa very affordable for thermal pool & sauna etc.Outdoor pool is heated but still chilly!We asked for a sunny room 463 was perfect.We will definitely be back!"
Dec 2017,30,Condition of room does not justify 5 stars,"First of all the positives,  the hotel sits on the beautiful Santa Eulalia beach with breathtaking views across the ocean,  the reception is a large open plan area with bar and entertainment area, the staff are informative and welcoming, the food - we booked the gala dinner on Christmas Eve and the Brunch on Christmas Day, the food on both occasions was of a high standard with attentive staff.The negative, the condition of our room and the poor WiFi signal the lack of charging points for mobile phones tablets etc.We were in room 108 this room needs a complete update, the carpet was badly stained and in my opinion should be removed from booking until the problem is rectified, we had a problem with the bath not draining water, the solution was to remove the bath plug, this solved the problem when taking a shower but removed the option to take a bath, basic standards for any hotel nevermind a five star, overall the stained carpet detracted from  our stay in this hotel, for the reasons stated this places this hotel 3-4 star certainly not 5 star."
Dec 2017,50,December weekend treat,"Stayed before at least 4 times.  Friendly staff, welcoming front desk.  Clean and well maintained.  Beautifully appointed hotel.  Our favourite beach so clean and relaxing to stroll along pre breakfast.Would most definitely return and recommend to friends and family ."
Dec 2017,50,grand real santa eulalia top class hotel,One of the best hotel experiences we have had .location food rooms and staff all without fault. will definately look for vacancies when we rerturn to portugal.  Everyone very helpful and friendly. Very clean and smart
Dec 2017,50,Superb hotel,"This was a last minute spontaneous break for us after a trip advisor email and this hotel was more than we had anticipated. We have been in this area before and wanted somewhere peaceful and close to the beach and also within walking distance to local amenities. We arrived very early and receptionist was extremely helpful and as our room was ready we went straight there. The room and ensuite bathroom (shower in bath) was spotless and the balcony was a generous size and overlooked the beach. The bed was large and comfortable. We had booked breakfast which was fabulous, so much choice was wonderful and the staff were pleasant and helpful. There are a couple of restaurants and beach snack bar at the hotel. We had snacks at the beach bar - good food with reasonable prices with gorgeous views. We walked into the Strip (10 mins) at nights for food and one night to Olhos d'Agua (30 mins) so even off season great location. The hotel operate a return courtesy bus several times per day into Albuefeira which was a fantastic resource. The Spa is lovely and reasonably priced. The pools look lovely but it was a bit chilly in late November to swim! Great wifi throughout. Would certainly return and fully recommend. I guess summer would be a completely different experience but the resort is spacious, has car parking is at the beach and you could spend a whole holiday without leaving the resort."
Dec 2017,40,Beautiful setting : right onto the beach,"We went looking for warmer climes for a short break in Dec. Very well priced 67 euros for a double room for two with buffet breakfast, which was varied and of a good quality ,  and a solid 4 star hotel but not really a 5 : we have provoked and paid for a spa session for 2 ( not included🤔) but was disappointed that the water temperature was only 30°c and so we couldn't avail of the facilities ( sauna, Jacuzzi, jet pool and Turkish steam room). We were refunded the extra payment but it was one of the reasons for booking to stay there so disappointed. The layout of the hotel is pleasing with direct access onto a beautiful sandy beach. A free shuttle bus available but a car is perhaps recommendable though not essential. Booked directly through hotel's own website: supposed to have been given a room upgrade for doing so  but it wasnt provided."
Dec 2017,50,Very good,Lights  when in bed poor. Unable to do crossword or read paper. Tea making facilities in room would be very much appreaciated. Speaking from over 55 age group. Absence of complimentary bus service to old and new town on Saturday and Sunday can be a disadvantage.
Dec 2017,50,Lovely place for conference and family stay,Went for a conference and stayed on.Lovely and quiet overlooking beautiful sea. 3 pools (2 warm) at the front.  Good rooms with balconies and lovely food with a superb breakfast.Local area pretty with plenty to do.  Town is a short walk or free shuttle away.Friendly staff and lovely beach.Great kids club and playground too!  Plus a beach side restaurant.Definitely coming back.
Dec 2017,50,Superb Week In Self Catering Luxury Apartment,"We just had a great week staying in the luxury apartments of The Grande Real Santa Eulilia Hotel/ Resort in Albefeuria. The service, setting & facilities were superb. We really enjoyed ourselves & will definitely return. We got excellent value,as it was out of season in December,but the weather was a very pleasant late teens/early twenties & consequently we got excellent value."
Dec 2017,40,"Hotel is big, the rooms are large.","The hotel was basically empty because of time of year. It was still sunny and bright about 16-17 degrees during the day. The breakfast was a delight and would accommodate anyone’s needs.My biggest gripe was with this large empty hotel we were given a room on the cold north east wind side where the sun never shone. Not what was required after leaving a cold wet England. We could have had our wine on the balcony in the afternoon sun, instead we did not open our balcony door Incase we froze in the cold wind."
Dec 2017,40,Great location,Extremely comfortable hotel with plenty facilities . Breakfast was outstanding with both cooked and continental selections. Courtesy bus to albufeira was great. Surrounding area quiet at this time of year however still plenty bars and restaurants open. Hotel on the main bus route for faro and albufeira bus station. Excellent wifi .
Dec 2017,50,"Spacious, lots of restaurants,4 pools, Fantastic Spa facility","Huge apartment space, tv, lots of wardrobe space, kitchen facilities, hob, kettle, toaster, microwave oven, utensils, fridge...spacious balcony. Staff very helpful, Spa staff very professional. Private beach, palm trees.....lovely!"
Dec 2017,50,Great clean hotel with superb facilities and friendly staff,"Visited for one night only but were left with wanting more. The reception welcome was great and offered a sea view as low season. Fantastic room, clean, roomy and a very very comfortable bed. The breakfast was worth the room rate alone and so much choice. The grounds were immaculate and the walk to the beech Quick and easy. Thoroughly recommend."
Dec 2017,50,6 night stay in November with my daughters,"Thank you, for a lovely, memorable stay at your very impressive hotel. The apartment was spot on, loved the extra large bed and kitchen facilities. The staff were very attentive and helpful, looking forward to a return trip as soon as possible"
Dec 2017,40,Lovely resort with private access to a beautiful beach,"The staff and the resort were excellent. Any issues we had were resolved quickly and with a personal touch, made our stay that much more enjoyable. The apartments are spacious and have an outdoor patio area and large doors. The cooking facilities are useful and the staff will wash up for you, but I bought own cleaning equipment. Would have been useful to have condiments for cooking provided. The larger supermarket is a 10 mins walk with a slope so not the most convenient to get shopping. But still, useful for getting everyday items. The shuttle bus stops in new town and old town. I think this would have benefited from an extra stop at the Albufeira Shopping centre.I enjoyed Atlantico restaurant very much, delicious food and fabulous view. The gourmet burgers at pergula were delicious too but as it is just burgers, not a place to go to more than once or twice. The evening dinner in the main restaurant was, frankly, awful. Service was incredibly slow, the food was slow in coming out and incredibly salty. Did not appreciate the snobbery for refusing me a glass of tap water! I had much nicer meals on the restaurant strip 10 mins away."
Dec 2017,50,Best hotel,Verry nice experience. Best hotel. I will come back with first ocasion. The breakfast is the best. Wonderfull moments. Wonderful view on the balcony. I'll recomanded for familly and for friends too. Try burger on the restaurant. It's the best
Dec 2017,50,Fabulous stay,The whole resort had a 5star feeling to it. Our luggage was transferred to our apartment via golf style buggy. There was a free bus to the New and Old towns. There were no noise issues such as busy roads or loud music. I would recommend.
Nov 2017,40,Holiday,"The hotel's location is great, however i would not consider it as a 5* hotel based on the following.The hotel is old and tired, there is no indoor pool and the equipment in the gym are rusty and need attention. Spa is too expensive.However, the staff are very friendly, polite and helpful, also the rooms are very clean and specious.But, I found the food is blend and ordinary for 5* hotel. and the entertainment is poor.  But the beach and the view is great. We stayed 11 day and enjoyed it."
Nov 2017,50,Impressive site & excellent service,"Although out of peak season, the service was fully efficient, and everything was accessible end clean. The view from the room was outstanding. A pleasant stay in one of the best beaches in Algarve...."
Nov 2017,50,Beautiful and peaceful,Wish I could have spent another week there!! People lovely service great complimentary shuttle into old and new town. Apartment perfect.  Lovely relaxing week in November cant wait to come back hopefully before next November
Nov 2017,50,Fantastic experience and excellent leisury break,"We had a fantastic, professional service which added to the leisure break experience.  The location, weather and services were fantastic! Thank you! We will have a lovely memories from our stay. And we will be back..."
Nov 2017,30,Tired in all areas,"Having stayed at this hotel & the sister hotel in Olhao l feel equipped to give a reasonable assessment of the Real group. I rated Real Grande 4 out of 5 & Santa Eulalia as you can see lower.Building works (rooms being oak laminated) were generally unobtrusive, but dust was all over the corridors and carpets, even in areas. Going down to dinner one evening, I thought we'd been gas attacked! The stench was nauseating.Food is of good quality & my huge sea-view room was superb, but apart from the main bar all other public areas are tired, although the Aztec them does mask the problem a little. Attention to the little details is generally not observed....Flickering light bulbs not changed; guests being allowed to ""vape"" in the bar area is a disgrace.All in all disappointed."
Nov 2017,50,Amazing hotel.,"It was a really nice experience, with o good selection for the breakfast, with friendly staff. The hotel is very clean, like the beach as well. I will definitely come back on the summer time. This only disappointment was that I payed for a see view room, and it was not. I could see the sea only from one side from the balcony. But was nice."
Nov 2017,50,Superb hotel!,"My first time staying at this hotel and was very impressed with the outstanding customer service from all staff! I had a lovely holiday and would defiantly go back. Great location on a private  beach, very high standard of hygenie throughout the hotel a and good choice of restaurants in the resort. Overall very happy with my stay and look forward to going back. Even through it was out of season there was still enough options for eating out and day trips."
Nov 2017,50,superb hotel,"5 star well deserved!!!!. Beautiful hotel with a lovely private beach. Very attentive friendly staff. Nothing was to much trouble .All  areas were spotlessly clean, Good sized rooms and bathrooms.  Excellent food!!!! Freshly cooked and  a great variety. The best I have come across.  Can't fault anything about this hotel.  Had a  wonderful relaxing holiday. I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. Hope to return in the future."
Nov 2017,40,My stay in Portugal at Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa,"The apartments need some TCL. Sofa and centre table need cleaning or changing. Did not expect to see dirt/stain in a 5☆ hotel. The mattress is hard. My partner found it very difficult to sleep on. This was my 3rd time in Portugal and found all the beds in the 3 hotels I have stayed are hard.  I think this is a Portugal thing, not everyone has a bad back. Orthopaedic mattress. The cleaners do a good job of cleaning.  Towels bed sheets and pillows were very clean. No sweaty pillows. Overall I love this hotel. This is the best hotel I stayed at in Portugal. This was also my partners birthday trip and his first time in Portugal.  The hotel surprise us with a cake and bottle of wine. This was very lovely. The restaurant next to reception we had burger and chips on our 1st evening.  There was a long black hair in the chips. Kitchen staff need to cover there hair to prevent this from happening."
Nov 2017,50,Excellent 3 night stay,staff noticed when photocopying or passports that it was my husbands Bday & gave us a complimentary bottle of chilled prosecco & Bday cake to the room (complete with lighter to light candle on cake!) very thoughtful - & attention to detail second to none
Nov 2017,50,Super relaxed,"Was astonished about the friendliness and service in a relaxed atmosphere, although it is a big hotel.Maybe also traveling ""out of season"" helped.Many offers for relaxing, shopping, touring and an overall super beach."
Nov 2017,50,One of the best hotels,"Had a great stay last week. We thought the overall standard and service was excellent and will definitely be back next year.  The shuttle bus service is also very good, but the distance to main shops and bars is easily walkable and very enjoyable."
Nov 2017,50,alan &christine belfast,eat hotel in every way staff most helpful and courteous. excellent food and great rooms with great bathroom and hot water at all times. will be booking for a week in may 2018. we had a great holiday and cant wait to return . thanks to everyone for a fantastic holiday..
Nov 2017,30,Good but not five star.,"We went to Grande, in the middle of November with exceptional weather. The location of hotel is nice, but if it didn't have the addition of a private beach then we probably wouldn't of booked a stay. I can imagine this place getting super packed in peak season, so it was nice having the place quiet. We had our little toddler with us and we stayed in a self catering apartment, this was challenging when every light switch and some drawers were accessible and the front door wasn't lockable from the inside and found ourselves placing the buggy in front of the door to stop him getting out, the sliding doors across the cooking area was a good idea.The apartment was fine although some worn decor need some attention. The cleaning service was very good. The breakfast food was good if your'e not a fussy eater, for a 5 star you'd expect a better waiting service, and when sat by the pool it would of been nice to have somebody bring drinks,The heated pool wasn't that ""heated"" but bearable. They have a inside pool, but this is astronomically priced at $19 for just 1 hour. hence why no-one was in it. So not good. The beach being the main highlight of the resort, I thought at least having some recliners/sunbeds on the beach would've been the least they could have supplied. For a off peak price it was value for money but we wouldn't pay peak prices.The staff were friendly enough, and would visit again if it was the right price."
Nov 2017,50,Outstanding service :)),On arrival to the hotel we were welcomed by the friendly staff who provided us with all the information we needed for our stay. The rooms were fernishsd to a very high standered with a nice sized balcony with fantastic views. There was a huge variety of food at the hotel that was delicious and great value. The spa facilities added a nice relaxing retreat that you were able to endulge in at your choice not to mention the gym. Lastly the shuttle bus service that brought you to and from the old and new town was efficient and always on time. This was our first visit to portugal as a couple and are already excited to book out next trip. Not only is it a great romantic holiday it is perfect for families too.
Nov 2017,30,Not a Five Star,"We stayed as a family x 6 October/November 2017 and we were very disappointed with our stay.  It is not a 5 star - 3 to 4 star at best.  Our apartment was clean but definitely in need of an upgrade.  The hotel itself is welcoming and clean.  Reception were friendly.  We stayed on a half board basis - breakfast was very good but evening buffet was very poor in both quality and choice of food.  To make things worse the food was lukewarm at best.  In fact we ate there only twice.  There is an excellent shuttle service.  The pools are nice but when he stayed there, it seemed to have closed down for the season.  The outside snack bars were closed.  The kiddie club was excellent, however their playground could be bigger - we were there in the quiet season, I cant imagine what it must be like in high season with kids - very much needs to be bigger.  Will I go back to this hotel - a definite No."
Nov 2017,50,wonderful place to stay,"We stayed in November, and the weather was brilliant, warm and sunny every day. We spent our days on the stunning beach, lunches at the atlantico bar, which has to be the most picture perfect beach bar we have ever seen. Food and services were good too. We had a sea view suite which was very spacious, with 2 bathrooms and a very comfortable bed. It was spotlessly clean. Would highly recommend this hotel at this time of year if you want a very relaxing holiday"
Nov 2017,50,Great Hotel,"great hotel, friendly staff, lots of restaurants, nice pools although only one was heated. overall a great experience. the location is secluded but thats what i went there for. lovely venue though and the breakfast was well worth it"
Nov 2017,50,Excellent customer service,"Just back from amazing stay in Grande Real Santa Eulalia. The staff at reception are so helpful and friendly and really go out of their way for you. The hotel and apartments are the cleanest I’ve ever seen, the cleaning staff do an amazing job. I would highly recommend this hotel as it is so secure for families and is the nicest hotel in Albufeira by far. We will definitely return some day!"
Nov 2017,50,excellent,beautiful hotel will visit again professional service and excellent staff very clean and serviced hotel great location shuttle bus was very nice service into town very relaxing will visit again thanks for everything family visit
Nov 2017,50,Excellent,My Husband and I stayed last week on a bed and breakfast basics and we were delighted with our stay. Hotel is in a beautiful setting. All staff very helpful and professional. Room amazing with a great sea view (213) Comfortable beds.  Breakfast amazing. Our stay was perfect and we would highly recommend this hotel and area. Many thanks to everyone who provided an excellent service and made out stay wonderful. All staff should be very proud of their high standards of service provided.
Nov 2017,40,Lovely resort,"Hotel was in good location 10 mins from shops restaurants, the rooms were cleaned daily and cleaned well, outside pools very cold but then is was November but the pool areas very nice, well equipped gym, lovely beach, would stay again"
Nov 2017,50,The best apartment ever !!,"What a fantastic place to stay! Everything in this place is just first class. We are currently staying in one of the apartments and could not see any single fault in this place. Rooms are being cleaned every day, the place is so relaxing , very quiet at nights and we always had a good night sleep. We will be sad to go later today but will definitely come back next time. My son who is 7 haven't been to the kids club so I cannot comment on that but the stunning beach and surrounding areas are more than enough for him/us getting entertained. The staff who cleaned our room deserved a massive thank you and recognition, not only it was Cleaned but also a personal touch was added to it. It was the way my sons toys were arranged, how lovely! It made my son so happy , so thank you so much."
Nov 2017,50,Honeymoon,Couldn’t fault our visit from start to finish. All staff were very friendly and helpful. The room we got was a suite and it was beautiful. An excellent place to spend a honeymoon or special event as a treat .
Nov 2017,50,Excellent Location,"Fabulous location right on beach, hotel very comfortable and having an upgrade to the rooms when we were there, so maybe better again in future - have stayed before and will return again. Bus into Albuferia very handy and adds some varaiation to the stay. Food in hotel good and bars offer good service. Beach side bar good value and pleasant addition to hotel. We stayed in November (weather was excellent) but cant verify how busy the hotel is in mid summer - but has pool sidecafe/bars and nightclub also, so could be good fun for all ages."
Nov 2017,50,Disabled Access,"The hotel definitely needs to upgrade access, ie flat routes to compliment the cobbled areas, the route to the beach was horrendous all cobbles also no disabled access to the paths in front of the beach bar or to same"
Nov 2017,40,summer/winter holiday,Surroundings and beach was fantastic and weather for time of year could not of been better.Apartment was very suitable but would been better with a balcony facing the sun.Hotel was very accessible to all Patrons had a nice time might come back sometime in the future.
Nov 2017,50,Fantastic stay at a fantastic hotel!,"Overall, fantastic stay at this hotel. Its 5 star rating has truly been earned! Our best trip to Portugal to date! Special thanks to Rafael at the hotel bar for his friendliness and attentive service during our stay."
Nov 2017,50,Lovely resort,Lovely resort our 5th visit. Close to local bars and restaurants about a 10 min walk left out of the resort. A 15 min taxi ride to old town. We stayed in an apartment which has a small kitchen. The food in the local bars and restaurants is relatively cheap so not really worth buying food in the supermarket.
Nov 2017,50,Another great stay !,"This has to be hands down the best Hotel in the Algarve This was our 9th or 10th visit.Why look for anywhere else ,They have everything here .....Access to the beach plenty of pools .Great food ,wonderful staff,beautiful rooms,There is nothing else anyone could wish for and we have travelled a lot.I travelled with my daughter and granddaughter and there was plenty of activities to suit all tastes.We had a suite this time and it worked out very well.We will be back in the Summer"
Nov 2017,40,Honeymoon,"Fabulous hotel , location. Not ideal for young people in October not a lot going on! Albufeira is a very relaxed place this time of year. The natives are extremely nice do everything they can for you. Overall it was a well deserved, relaxed break  👰🤵"
Nov 2017,50,Great holiday,Great hotel. Went self-catering. Quiet location. Ideal for a relaxed holiday. All facilities available if required. Staff there to help if needed. Nothing too much trouble.Apartments well equipped. Cleaned every day. Maintenance staff very efficient.
Nov 2017,50,Beautiful hotel with great staff.,"This beautiful hotel is very impressive and their staff are so friendly and helpful that it’s a pleasure to stay there. We had a sea view room and the sea is so close you can hear the waves washing onto the beach. Lots of places to sit and enjoy the 3 pools and the bar. We enjoyed it so much we have already booked to return at Easter, can’t wait  Hotel really is 5*"
Nov 2017,50,Can’t get enough of this place,"Have been 3 times and coming back in April.  This hotel ticks all the boxes for us.  We are a family five, 2 adults and 3 children between ages 2 and 9.  Would like a little more ambience at the restaurants and more entertainment, but aside from that we love it.  Incredible location and very helpful staff."
Nov 2017,50,TOTAL REAL RELAX,Hotel and location 1st Class!  Hotel and all staff make this a very relaxed and calm place to spend a holiday.   Great facilities and lots of very kind and efficient staff.   Excellent food and lovely restaurants.
Nov 2017,40,WKC World Championships stay,"Very nice hotel, with very helpful staff, prices in bars and restaurants are reasonable for a hotel of this category. Had a great stay during the event which my son took part in. Nice pool area to relax after the competitions, lovely beach. Loved the free shuttle bus into town.Rooms could be a little bigger."
Nov 2017,50,Just as good as ever 6th time round....,Some places change over the years and no doubt there have been subtle changes here and there with this hotel but the important stuff has been consistently good if not better each time we visit. Very reasonable bar prices. Excellent kids club staff.
Nov 2017,30,Lovely hotel but staff seem demotivated ,"We were at this hotel for 2 weeks, half board. The food was lovely and the facilities very good especially the kids club. However, the staff were generally grumpy. Hardly a greeting and never a smile even though we were there eating everyday. The main building was lovely but the apartments need some modernising. I think some staff training would go a long way into making this hotel a true 5 star resort."
Nov 2017,40,Relaxing Long Weekend Break,"Very nice hotel set in extensive, well maintained grounds. Although rated as a 5 star, I feel that some areas could be improved to a 5 star overall level compared to some 4 or even excellent 3 star previously stayed in. We had a suite in the main hotel with sea view that was very clean and spacious size, but feel that a fridge would be much better in the room rather than mini bar and also tea/coffee facilities should be standard in each room (not having to request if desired). All towels are provided, including pool/beach, and toiletries - handy when only travelling with hand luggage. The resort sits overlooking the beach at Santa Eulalia but is not private to the hotel. Sun beds etc are no longer available for hire in the winter season. The fish restaurant on the beach is also out of season. Numerous areas/restaurants/Le Club of the resort are closed for the winter, although Atlantico Cafe overlooking beach was excellent for lunch with an extensive menu. Cocktails in the main bar, highly recommended.The pool area is very pleasant and enjoyable to have breakfast if desired. Breakfast was super with lots of choice. All staff were friendly and polite.Numerous bars, restaurants, supermarkets are within walking distance - turn right when leaving resort towards Olhos de Agua or left takes you to Santa Eulalia/Oura/ New Town and The Strip."
Nov 2017,40,Wedding Stay.,The hotel was fabulous - the food in the hotel bar was very expensive - I ordered 5 toasted ham and cheese 4 fries and 4 cokes 2 beers and it cost 101.90 . . outside bar was very limited in drinks but I guess it was end of season so its to be expected - But they new we were a large group coming for my wedding they should of stocked it better. the Beds were so uncomfortable I didnt sleep much but thats just me maybe invest in proper mattresses for the apartments the hotel beds were lovely and comfy. over all it was a pleasant stay and I would return but maybe to the hotel part not the Apartments. Wifi was non-existent in the main bedroom due to the thick walls might be a good idea to install a repeater to boast signal. my phone bill will be huge :( . . defo coming back though.
Nov 2017,30,5 Stars should be better,"...for a hotel with 5 star classification: Kids club ok, evening entertainment very poor, breakfast and lunch in a noisy atmosphere with poor ambiente, staff friendly, to many hotel-facilities closed, no timeslots for kids in the SPA area (shall be published before), hotel and resort areas very clean, the rooms too."
Nov 2017,50,On holiday in Portugal.,Went to see the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort Hotel as our daughter is getting married there next year. Must say this is a quality Hotel staff were really nice. We told them of the wedding and they showed us apartments and rooms and then treated us to a drink out on the main veranda.Really good thanks Grande Santa Real.
Nov 2017,40,Enjoyable stay,"This was our 4th time we have stayed here in the last 4 years which I think speaks for itself. It is a beautiful hotel with good facilities in a good location but the rooms are becoming a little ""tired""  Having said that work has recently started to refurbish them . The carpets are being replaced with laminate and the rooms are being redecorated . Cant wait to return next year to see the finished product."
Nov 2017,50,Fantastic Hotel for all.,"I stayed here with my pregnant wife looking for a nice relaxing holiday and overall was not disappointed. Expecting our first child we were looking for a special holiday as it would be our last as just a two. This is the reason we chose Santa Eulalia, the 5 star rating, excellent reviews and reasonable price. First of all the journey from the airport is not bad at all, roughly around 40 mins. We booked transfers prior to the journey, which I highly recommend as we got a great deal, so I'm not sure how much it would cost in a taxi. When we first arrived, we were amazed by the look of the hotel. It resembles a gated community with the apartments near the entrance and a drive up to the main hotel building. Stunning decor inside with nice big comfy couches to sit and relax. Check in was quick and easy, our room was ready before the stated time and alot of information was given about local attractions and excursions, couldn't fault the staff at all. We stayed in a double / twin room with a resort view (I think the cheapest room), although the least expensive in price it was spacious and very much up to the standard of what you would expect from a 5 star rating. Plenty of wardrobe space, fridge, shower/ bath, TV. The only fault I could find was the signal on the TV. There wasn't a variety of channels and more than half had poor signal, this didn't bother me however as I wouldn't come on holiday to watch TV! The location, in my opinion, is absolutely perfect. From what I gathered the resort had its own private beach which was quite big, there was alot of space to relax and wasn't crowded. Access to the beach is through a gate where you scan your room key (this, quite embarrassingly, puzzled us until we see someone do it as no one told us this information!) The sand can be abit stoney in areas but there's nice soft sand in most areas. The hotel provides shuttle transfers to both the New Town and Old Town around 4 or 5 times a day although the last one is before dinner, 6.25pm, maybe a cunning way to get you to eat and then stay in the hotel for drinks after! A taxi to either is inexpensive, walking is possible to the New Town which we did a few times, although up a Hill!  Onto the food. We were half board so had breakfast and dinner included. I thought a nice touch was to allow you to use your dinner voucher for a 3 course lunch meal which was delicious with alot of choice. Breakfast was a buffet style with a wide variety which would satisfy anyone and everyone, I discovered the pancakes and Nutella on the very last day which I was devastated about! Everything you would want in a good old fashioned English fry up apart from the sausages which I don't think anyone liked! Also, free champagne at breakfast? Wow.Dinner. Different everyday and never your typical burger and chips, which I find a good thing. Alot of fish, vegetarian and meat dishes to satisfy everyone. Desserts were fantastic, definitely impressive. The only issue was with the temperature of the food, it was never hot, always lukewarm. Maybe it was due to there not being many people at dinner or the time we were going but it definitely needs looking at by management as I've seen it mentioned in other reviews. A nice hot meal would make it 10/10 for food. As both the breakfast and dinner were served in the Real Corzinha restaurant I can't comment on the others, I did have a few drinks in the bar in reception, (Perugula) I think? This was very nice, cocktails were fantastic, staff, excellent. Facilities and entertainment. There were a few different pool areas which meant they were never crowded which was nice, this time of year meant they were absolutely freezing though! There is a spa and gym there but with the gyms old rusting equipment and the charge of 20 euros for 45 mins in the spa pool, I can't see how anyone ever uses either! I don't know if the spa is run through a separate company but the prices are absurd, some treatments and massages were nearly 150€, maybe most guests have more money than I do but I definitely wouldn't want to be ripped off, spa's we found in the old town were half the price. However, more positively entertainment was fantastic. There's a kids club and an activity schedule for children and adults to enjoy. Live music every evening was up to a high standard and a nice way to relax after a meal.Despite a couple of small moans we very much enjoyed our stay here and would 100% return. Thank you to the excellent staff and hotel for making the holiday a memorable one."
Nov 2017,50,Excellent stay,"Excellent facilities with a multitude of bars, restaurants and pools. Great for family stay. Slight issue with broken bath plug and tired balcony seats but staff were quick and kind to fix.Went for nippers birthday and delighted with the unexpected surprise Happy Birthday cake and champagne really sweet touch to top a nice short getaway! Staff friendly and attentive, would highly recommend, full of families with young children this time of year which was nice for our nipper in the great pools. Awesome views from the hotel of the beach, sea and green landscape."
Nov 2017,40,Good,"Polite reception, quiet and clean room, but I strongly recommend that if you want to reserve online, just choose ""free cancel"" I did a mistake while choosing the dates and I had to cancel my reservation with payment"
Nov 2017,50,Photosynthetic championships,"O stayed her for kickboxing world chapionships , hotel was lovely and staff friendly not a long walk in to town but they do have a free bus running. I would stay here on a proper holiday, room and apartment are grate and clean. Quick walk to the beach which has a cafe along the way with dose amazing ice cream"
Nov 2017,50,Valentyna,"Excellent brake, every time i go to this hotel i enjoy my stay very much .Real 5 star hotel.Think rooms getting a bit dated but even so this is miner things over all. Will for sure come back again and recommend all my friends to visit too."
Nov 2017,50,Fantastic hotel,"This is our second year in October to visit and the hotel is fantastic, with great food and facilities. It is scrupulously clean and the staff are great. The hotel is nicely situated to visit Alubeferia and Vilamoura, plus many local areas. Cant wait to go back again. 😀"
Oct 2017,50,Surprised by lack of security in this day,"The Hotel and Staff were great , our apartment was of a beautiful standard and the housekeeping staff do a brilliant job , We found every part of the hotel is kept to a beautiful standard including the pools and outside terraces , My Only concern in the day and age that there is no security checking who is going in and out of the facilities"
Oct 2017,50,Relaxing family holiday,"Second visit to this hotel, service and food is always excellent, stayed in a suite both times so that our teenager has her own bedroom and bathroom.Half board option is excellent for a buffet breakfast and buffet evening meal, with lots of choice and quality food on offer."
Oct 2017,50,Sister Abroad,"Wonderful hotel, can't fault a thing. Staff friendly. Food and service excellent.Rooms very clean and spacious.Views and pool areas excellent.Good for all types, families, couples, young and older travellers. Wouldn't recommend for Stag or Hen holidays.Beautiful setting in a quiet area but not far from the buzz of the main strip. A small taxi journey or the free shuttle bus to the Old Town Area."
Oct 2017,40,Generally a very pleasant stay,"Pool was a bit cool, environment was excellent, beach easily accessible and beautiful.  Few external restaurants close to the hotel.  Everything was very clean and the hotel was good in taking care of luggage on the day of check out and offering an excellent shower and towel."
Oct 2017,50,October 2017,"This is a lovely resort. It has private access to a beach just a short 5-10 minute walk from the rooms (there are a lot of steps though). The drinks were cold, the suites were incredibly comfortable and spacious. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We went towards the end of the season so the club was not open. Everything was very clean.The internet only worked in your room - and sometimes on the balcony. You did not have wifi throughout the resort unless you were in the main lobby/area of the hotel. The beach restaurant was a bit pricey and did not have as many options as we would have liked. With the price you pay, it would be nice to have breakfast included."
Oct 2017,40,4 Star Review of the 5 Star Hotel,"Firstly, we love this hotel and apartment complex and have visited it for the 5th time last week. I'll list, in no particular order the things that draw us back and areas I think need improvement. Location - everything from an easy flight from Belfast, short drive or bus trip to Albufeira, the hotel perched above the best beach on the Algarve, close proximity to Albufeira if you like that type of town. Villa Mouira is just a short taxi also. Accommodation - we love the apartment area we normally reserve, close to a pool, with beautiful Portugese sunlight (normally) waking you up on your private terrace. That said the apartments are dated inside, but comfortable, spacious, superbly cleaned by good staff daily, attentive to any requests for missing items etc. We have always found the cleaning staff to be top class.Kids - now we only have one child so like many, our little lady is the most important part of any holiday. The Kids Club staff are simply fantastic. Marta, Jessica and the guys looked after our little lady every day for a little while (longer if you want to leave you child morning and afternoon but we only choose and hour or two in the morning). On our last trip this was the highlight of our holiday seeing our little angel so well cared for and taking part in their room based activities. This is all amazing. Now I do have to comment on the hotel making an investment to bring this facility into a more modern acceptable level - the room is very warm and the playground is very limited. I've read others reviews of this and agree the hotel needs to invest heavily here. You have the most fantastic staff, please make some investment in the facility. You have the best staff, now you need the best Kids Club area so we can all shout about it. Bar Atlantico - this is another reason we go to this resort. Its location between the hotel and the beach is stunning. Its also open to the public. Now versus last number of times we've been I have to say the standard of food has dropped, the staff are not as friendly as they used to be, with one exception. I am not concerned about staff but seriously disappointed in the quality of food for lunches.Hotel Food - we only used the hotel on one occassion, the last night for the buffet dinner. I really enjoyed it but as one other reviewer commented they have not mastered the art of keeping carvery style food warm. This is a concern but for me I really enjoyed the meal and inclusive drinks. Logistics - there is a superb free bus service to town running though the day and evening. Also the Front of House guys who manage luggage and drive you around in the buggies are great, always with a smile and very professional and courteous. There are some other aspects of this hotel that bug me - why in a 5 star hotel do you not have access to the indoor pool free of charge, as a paying guest? Happy Hour, now removed for no good reason? Look, I do love the Resort but I now face a dilemma - have we become too familiar with the GRSE, without having another 5 star resort to compare it against. I promise you this is a great place to vacation and with beautiful sunshine you can have a great time BUT versus UK&Ireland Hotels this would definitely only be a 4 star. So it comes down to Value for Money and thats all in what deal you choose !!"
Oct 2017,50,high quality hotel at the sea,"Grand hotel directly at the sea, nice beach. The rooms are big with nice balconies to the sea. Unfortunately the carpet is old and not clean, this could be better. The mattresses are very hard.Breakfast was great."
Oct 2017,50,40 years marriage,"maybe consider coffee in the room?location :on the beach. seavew: beautiful very kind crew spa great and massage gorgeouslocation: away from ,and yet not too far from town centermaybe suggest not to many dance partys near swimming pool?"
Oct 2017,40,Holiday,"Expensive holiday but hotel clean and staff friendly and polite. Very helpful on the reception desk. Carpet in the hotel room very tired and discoloured, bed comfortable. Buffet food not very hot, kept lukewarm. Relaxing break by the pool and very close to the beach. Shuttle bus useful as not much nearby."
Oct 2017,40,Good,More breakfast en dinner choise. The minibar is missing. The airconditioning could not handle.Service in restaurant was to late and food not to warm. With service Will hopefully be better.Otherwise the stay was very pleasant.
Oct 2017,50,a weeks holiday,"Had a great time here, nice, clean, excellent facilities and staff, the only niggle was the water pressure in the shower in my room, the rest of my stay was excellent.  I didn't want to leave. The beach and pool were excellent, the bars and restaurants were good with good service, I would stay here again."
Oct 2017,40,Half term Family Holiday,"Just come back from this hotel, we had a lovely stay! Hotel is very clean and staff are friendly.Location is amazing, direct access through a card controlled gate onto a brilliant beach for kids, snack bar/toilets close too!Pool area was nice shame not all the pools onsite were heated though.Restaurants were ok but a bit more variety would be good for evening meals as the buffet is expensive and doesn't really cater for kids and the burger restaurant is limited. Breakfast was great though! Loads of choice kids loved it! We were b&b so it suited us. New town is walkable lots of restaurants there, old town is easy to get to on the free hotel bus, although if your thinking it's a quaint old fishing town it's definitely not! Very similar to the new town!The self catering appartments are nice a bit dated but the internet access is poor and the TV channels weren't good, no English kids programmes or films, if you have to put kids to bed relatively early I would download some films to the iPad from Netflix before you go!!All in all a great family holiday, the weather was amazing! Pool good, beach brilliant! Food fine, rooms good, location great and the kids had a great time. Happily go back."
Oct 2017,50,Great Hotel,"Our most relaxed holiday so far. The hotel is big, clean and staff are all very friendly. Only one pool was heated which is a bit of a downer as it can be quite busy but the access to the beach was very handy and one of the reasons why we picked the hotel. The food we’ve had were all excellent. The view when having a drink or having a meal was fantastic. We will definitely go back again."
Oct 2017,30,Hotel nice ..... let down by the food,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights as part of Costa Del Folk.The hotel itself is very nice, clean, expansive, lovely beach, couple of nice bars and pleasing decor.We had a 1 bedroom apartment at the back of the hotel near the (very busy) main road — very comfortable, well equipped and spacious. The main road was not a problem for us as the windows were double glazed and kept shut. Air conditioning was effective and not intrusively noisy.The staff were largely quite pleasant and friendly .... although there were 1 or 2 exceptions .... particularly one or 2 of the dinner waiters were a bit surly and couldn’t be bothered with smiling or being pleasant.In our opinion the food let this hotel down badly ..... the cooked bacon at breakfast was inedible and the other ‘hot’ breakfast offerings were cold and uninviting. The bread and pastries were ok but nothing special— fruit juice was nice and the coffee hot and strong!The food at the dinner buffet was unimaginative, bland and with limited choices. Queuing for a table in a 5 star hotel is not on ..... we had to do this on 2 of our 3 evenings. The food was never ‘hot’ and I did worry a bit about food poisoning, but thankfully we had no problems with illness at all.On the positive side, the waiters were quite generous in refuelling our wine glasses when they ran low!!I expected more quality from a supposed 5 star hotel......we would not book this hotel ourselves for a holiday, but we would come back to the hotel for another Costa Del Folk if the performers suited us."
Oct 2017,30,We were in room 224 and it was ery narrow & not enough hanging spade in the wardrobe,"The rooms could with updating & should never be five star. The pool sinloungers should have mats on them as they are very uncomfortable. We travelled with Enjoy travel & was very disappointed with it all as we paid allot of money for our trip, I would not go back again"
Oct 2017,40,Short trip,The hotel was very nice; unfortunately we had very few time to exploit all its potential and also the season was not the best. Notwithstanding we had a very pleasant stay and we consider this property with a very high value for money
Oct 2017,50,Very relaxing family Hotel and apartments........perfect,"A great location with lots of swimming pools and a short walk to the beach. We stayed in a self catering apartment, these are a class and more above some of others we've stayed in. They were cleaned every day to a very high standard. The cleaning team deserve some high praise for their work.The hotel has good facilities, friendly and helpful staff. It was a perfect quiet location which is what we needed as a family."
Oct 2017,40,Very good but not 5 star,"I have stayed at this hotel previously and couldn't fault it before.... this time however I found the staff to be ""just doing their jobs"" they did not go out of their way to be friendly or helpful as on previous stays at the hotel. In general it is a fab hotel, very quiet and a bit out of the way on a lovely beach if you like that sort of holiday!!"
Oct 2017,50,Enjoyable Holiday- Would like to re-book a different apartment preferbably apt 508.,"Hi , i stayed in apartment 401,( a 1 bedroom apartment). I liked the apartment but i thought the wardrobe in the main bedroom was musty. Also the apartment was right beside the exit of the underground and there I was a bit of noise in and out.I would v much like to stay in the complex again but like the ground floor apartments no, 507 , 508 and 509 near the pool.I would be interested in 10 nights from the 23rd of July 2018. Can you confirm price and availability,We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at the hotelThanks,Mary Clinton"
Oct 2017,40,Little corner of calm and sparkling cleanliness,"Had a lovely 10 days here with caring, professional staff, and a beautiful, quiet room. The pool is fabulous (although I like it fresh!) and the breakfasts are good and wholesome if a little predictable.We were half board and found the dinners a bit uninspiring and weren’t very keen on eating in the basement every evening but overall we would recommend the Eulália. A lovely place for a relaxed holiday."
Oct 2017,50,Perfect venue for a wedding!,"We got married here on 21st May 2017, the day was perfect from start to finish. I wouldHighly recommend this venue for having a wedding abroad. Our guests could not praise the staff and food enough and said it’s the best food they have had at a wedding. We stayed for 3 nights in a suite which was lovely. Very spacious and clean. We also had a lovely surprise on our wedding night coming back to our room / bee decorated. Special thank you to Angela who was great from the day we met her right up to when we checked out of the hotel. Once again I really can not praise this hotel enough and would love to return for a holiday one day."
Oct 2017,30,Not quite five-star,"""iIt's just like a liner"" I overheard one visitor say as they walked into the double height reception area with sweeping staircase. And in many ways it was with large areas for dining and relaxing, a bar that opened out onto a (sun)deck, and in the main hotel long corridors off which the cabins (sorry, bedrooms, were placed. It also, as other reviewers have noted, has apartment buildings in pretty garden surroundings. Plus of course, swimming pools and a beach.Everything was more than adequate, but places could do with a bit of freshening-upand at times service was slow. There was always a good choice at the breakfast buffet, a tendency for some dishes to run out at dinner (also buffet). The food was pleasant enough, but nothing to get excited over. Fortunately with a fridge in our room we could supplement the bar service with items from the supermarket, although the cocktails were certainly worth the price.Probably, because it was the end of the season not all the cafes and bars were open, but the beach bar was a lovely place for lunch, with prompt service and freshly cooked food. Pity it wasn't open in the evenings.It's advertised a five star resort, in my view it only just reached four."
Oct 2017,40,Nice place just avoid cooked breakfast ,We stayed in one of the apartments which was very well setup for family use. The baby cots had mattresses and they left out smarties for the babies when we arrived 😊 which went down well. The staff where all very friendly and helpful. The place was really nice and there was plenty of space. The bed in the apartment was hard but really big. There is a free bus that goes several times a day to Albufeira old town and new town. Handy - but Uber is quicker and more flexible option 😉So lots of positives - however I spent most of the holidays with an upset tummy / being sick. Can only put it down to the fried breakfast - as both mornings I had it i was sick for day and the next day 🤢 my family stuck to the non fry option and they where all grand.  On reading some other trip advisor reviews from people who stayed at the same time as us they seem to have got the same tummy bug issue 🤔
Oct 2017,40,Grande Real Santa Review,"Very good resort for a family holiday. The pools were clean and good (although it would be nice to have another heated pool), the staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Location was excellent and very close to the beach. Would happily stay again at the resort."
Oct 2017,50,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, good value and so close to the beach.  I was there for the folk music festival which was great fun and the hotel were very accommodating and perfect hosts from what I could tell.  I especially enjoyed the breakfast pastries!"
Oct 2017,40,Costa Del Folk 2017,"This is a bit of an odd review in that we were here for a folk festival and so that nearly everything we did was based on that premise.The travel company (Enjoy Travel) booked out most of the hotel to festival guests who either had an apartment in the grounds or a hotel room. I am personally glad we had an apartment as we had living space, a couple of tv's, a good sized bathroom, kitchen with fridge and microwave,air con (which stayed on when you left the apartment), easy to work safe and a massive (if a bit hard bed). There is a patio outside the room leading into a garden area.There was a pool and lounger area in our part of the complex (the bar and toilets not open during our stay). The west side formed part of the festival and so there was a stage set up there (bar and toilets open)The pools were all circular outside and either heated, seawater or chlorinated fresh (the latter 2 were really cold!!!The heated pool and seawater pool were between the hotel and the beach and this was another area of the festival where another stage was set up. Meals were taken in this area (we were on half board basis and so breakfast and evening meals were taken either inside or outside (it was unseasonable warm during our stay).Everything was key carded in the complex, so you could access the beach (through gates) and the same card used for your room or to leave the complex to visit the small supermarket 5 minutes up the road (under a hotel) or 20 minutes walk to a larger supermarket.We also used large conference rooms for the folk club (late night music) and for the main music auditorium where evening performances were held.There is a spa here with a large internal pool but we didn't use it.The hotel provides a bus (for us anyway, so you will have to check with the hotel to see if this the case normally) to visit Albufeira but we didn't use the service.I only have one gripe here and that I got a bad stomach here (it just made me feel really sick on the last day (I passed out on the plane home) and for the next 5 days when we returned home - my girlfriend didn't get it but she ate different things to me at breakfast and evening meal. Other people came down with similar complaints to me either while they were there or the day they arrived home. The meals were served under hot plates inside and in steel serving tureens outside. I can imagine that mass catering at hotels is full of problems in that the food has to stay safe to eat for 3 to 4 hours a day and it only takes one dish to make people ill. The drinks prices are standard for a 5 star hotel anywhere, in that beer was about 3.5 euros and spirits 4.5 euros. The unfair bit was that the hotel charged 2.5 euros for a glass of soft drinks or a splash, making a vodka and coke 7 euros - a bit of a rip off and people learned quickly not to order spirits from the bar.The staff here made us feel welcome and the ones we met were friendly with a good standard of English. We are looking forward to visiting this festival next year - hopefully with the same great weather."
Oct 2017,50,Excellent all round,Excellent hotel and facilities with free coach pick-up to the old and new town and back.  Food is excellent and so is the staff.  Very clean and spacious bedrooms and the restaurant facilities are very good with a wide choice of food.
Oct 2017,40,A week long stay for Costa del Folk,"This hotel was excellent on so many levels: cleanliness, facilities, comfy beds, good service and lovely views. Sadly, the well cooked and great choice of food served in the buffet restaurant at breakfast and dinner was ruined by the failure to keep it even vaguely warm. This obviously spoiled our enjoyment and also caused us to worry about how safe it was to eat. We noted the lamps above the food were LED - this would not help. If the hotel could address this very fundamental problem, it would deserve a very high rating. We specially enjoyed the access to the beach, the saltwater pool and the nearby Fatima bakery!"
Oct 2017,50,A wonderful experience.,The hotel was beautiful and the staff were very kind and helpful.My stay at your hotel was a wonderful experience and I look forward to returning in the future.The hotel ground's were well maintained and the hotel was spotless.
Oct 2017,50,Great hotel,"Excellent location( right on the beach), great service and the staff were very helpful. My wife is gluten and dairy intolerant and the staff did everything to accommodate her needs. Very happy with our stay, will definitely be back."
Oct 2017,50,Can't wait to come back,"We came for Costa del Folk and everything about the hotel was excellent.  The room was air-conditioned and very comfortable.  Breakfast and dinner were both excellent with plenty of choices.  Above all, the staff were all cheerful and helpful."
Oct 2017,50,Costa del Folk 2017 festival held at this hotel 9-15 October,"Fabulous holiday, one of our best ever. The festival was the main reason for going but everything worked wonderfully - flights, hotel, food and the festival. We had an apartment in the hotel grounds which was excellent and well equipped. Although we were on breakfast and dinner basis we could use the kitchenette facilities for tea and snacks whenever we wanted. The grounds were lovely and we had a pool near us that was virtually unused, like having a massive private pool. The staff were all very good and the buffet breakfast and dinner were both excellent. A very good hotel that I would be happy to recommend."
Oct 2017,50,Beautiful hotel in beautiful surrounding,Stayed here as part of the Costa del Folk festival. It was excellent all round. Food cleanliness and courtesy bus into old town. The pool area and grounds are lovely and right beside the beach. Different restaurants to suit different tastes and a lovely children’s play area. The balcony was large and private. The room furnishings were on the worn side but clean.
Oct 2017,20,Not a five star  Hotel !,"Stayed at this hotel for one week on a half board basis. Firstly and the only positives is the location and it is on the beach but you do have to pay E15 per day for sun beds for two people . The food at this hotel is below average and definitely not even four star standard. No Fresh grill area which you would expect.Buffet restaurant limited and  food constantly cold and when we complained we were offered to get it microwaved and subsequently we asked to speak to management but they didn’t seem to care and didn’t even offer a complimentary drink. Customer service or customer care not a priority at this hotel. Lunch time menu very limited and again food was cold . We ended up eating outside hotel for most of our trip in some very nice local restaurants. Rooms are old fashioned and in need of refurbishment. We did upgrade to seaview for the last four days for a cost of E120. Rooms have carpets which are stained and dirty.There was a Folk music tour staying at the hotel while we were there but apart from whatever music run by this tour group, entertainment at the hotel is non existent. Have stayed in many good hotels in Portugal and this is probably the worst for restaurant options and customer service.Very disappointing and we definitely do not recommend and would not return."
Oct 2017,50,Special Holiday for a Special Occasion,"Booked hotel for my wife's birthday and our 30th wedding anniversary. From the second we entered the hotel we had a 5 star time. The reception staff where so helpful and attentive giving us all the information we could possibly need. We had booked a suite with sea view and we were blown away with the rooms when we entered. For us it had everything we needed and more. On our first night after arriving late we had walked down to Martins just down the road to have one of the worst experiences we have ever had in a restaurant. We arrived to a half full place and be told they would see to us in a minute. 10 mins later after watching waiters running around looking busy to be told if we were looking to eat it would be 40mins wait!!!! Our experience lead us back to the hotel and onto the terrace to eat at the burger restaurant. Totally different experience. Treated so well and the food we had was first class served by lovely staff,Sleeping was great in a really large comfortable bed with no noise at all. Everything you need is provided in the bathroom. Also there is free use of a safe in the room.Breakfast for us was a really enjoyable time, Met every morning by pleasant staff who always had a smile. It was also great to have breakfast round the pool. Again for us there was a great amount to choose from and Prosecco provided every morning was a lovely touch. We spent our week on the beach  connected to the Hotel, Although when we stayed you could have got a sunbed at midday round the pool no problem, No people at 6 am putting towels on beds. The hotel provide you with Beach towels free of charge everyday which again is great also. You have to use your room key to get onto beach from Hotel and back in again.On the night of my wife's birthday we came back to our room to be met with a birthday cake and a bottle of Sparkly wine. It was a very unexpected surprise and we here both so pleased with the kindness.For us the holiday from the first second to the last was a 5 star experience. It will be a holiday we will not forget . Thank you to every member of staff in the hotel for making our holiday special."
Oct 2017,50,Costa Del folk week,"Good music,good company,good service. Air conditioning was good in the room.(248). The bed was comfortable. The food was very good,although I didn't care for the bacon and sausages in the morning. However there was plenty of choice. A healthier option was chosen. An all round wonderful experience."
Oct 2017,40,R Turner,Overall hotel was let down by the food.Hot food needs to be hot and late dinners need to be as good as early dinners.Have 2 queues for the dinning room - one for outside dining and 1 for inside dining.Have an egg chef for breakfast.We stay a lot in the Riu Hotels - their food experience is better than this hotel.
Oct 2017,50,"Good location, good service","We stayed here to attend a folk festival.  Rooms were comfortable although we found the air conditioning a bit problematic.  Restaurant staff were excellent, food, even though they were mass-catering via a buffet, was great.  There's a good beach attached the hotel."
Oct 2017,50,Amazing holiday,"Stayed here for 6 days with Costa del Folk. Hotel was fantastic. Beautiful rooms and great food.  Highlight was a heated outdoor pool, such luxury.  Free bus service into town also a great addition to the holiday. Really wonderful, we will return."
Oct 2017,40,Beautiful venue,"There were one or two issues (paint peeling off the wall of the apartment, phone not working, hot water not working, but these were dealt with very quickly and efficiently. The venue was located in a beautiful area and  we appreciated the transport into the nearby town. Everyone was welcoming and friendly."
Oct 2017,40,Ticks Most Of The Boxes!,"A nice hotel in a great location. A four star rather than a five in my opinion. Whilst the public areas of the hotel are smart and in a good condition, the room we stayed in was clearly in need of refurbishment. Our garden view apartment was last decorated many years ago (in garish colours)  and we didn't use the air con as it smelt so badly when it was switched on (an awful 'damp' smell). We loved the swimming pools, especially the heated pool, and there were plenty of sunbeds. The staff were good, except the older wine waiters, who studiously avoided our table most evenings. In the restaurant the food was OK, buffet style, but we weren't keen on sharing tables with other guests during busy times (anti social people like us should avoid eating at peak times!)."
Oct 2017,50,Costa del Folk Festival - Portugal 2017,Brilliant location for the festival. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and the free wine at dinner was a great bonus. Looking forward to returning to this hotel for Costa del Folk - Portugal 2018 in October next year
Oct 2017,50,Great Experience,"Stayed here for Costa Del Folk 2017. Provided a near-perfect venue for this event with excellent locations both indoors and out. They coped very well with the mass catering (although 'hot' food was sometimes fairly cold, even just having been served)."
Oct 2017,50,Costa del Folk,Enjoyed a great weekend of folk music here. Fabulous hotel with great service and lots of room to relax. The variety of pools and open spaces offered opportunities to be part of a crowd or to seek out somewhere quieter.
Oct 2017,50,Excellent Costa del Folk Location,"We stayed at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia for the 2017 Costa Del Folk festival and had a great time! The hotel is luxuriously equipped, with wonderful rooms, extensive restaurant options and friendly staff. It was a superb location for the Costa Del Folk festival and has already been booked again for the festival next year."
Oct 2017,50,Package stay for a folk festival,"Excellent choice for this type of event. Probably the best venue chosen by Enjoy Travel for their Costa Del Folk holidays, but would also be a good choice for a couples or family holiday without the added benefit of the folk music."
Oct 2017,40,Costa Del Folk,Great location for the festival! A lovely hotel with access to a great beach. The room was very comfortable and well serviced. It would have been better if tea and coffee making equipment had been provided.  Only minor gripe was the lack of choice of food for vegetarians at the main meal.
Oct 2017,50,Lovely stay,"We stayed for 6 nights with Costa del Folk in an apartment - half board. Staff were exceptional and the apartment was very well serviced every day. Good beds, shower, blackout curtains. Plenty of space for relaxation in the hotel lobby areas and outside terraces. Overlooks a gorgeous beach. Spa with gym machines and pool.Breakfast and dinner buffets were good, food could have been hotter.We had a great week and will be returning."
Oct 2017,40,"Friendly staff, wonderful location, fabulous breakfast","Really great stay here, lovely location, spotless, friendly staff, great choice at breakfast, it would be even better with a greater range of non-meat and fish options at dinner time. Lovely pool areas, wifi was mostly good but a little patchy in the mornings. Helpful staff, good free bus service into the old town. Firm bed, lovely beach area."
Oct 2017,50,Highly recomended,My husband and I stayed there for a week with the Paul Claffey tour. It was our 4th time staying here with our friends. Staff in hotel were excellent. We were well looked after. Music and entertainment were top class.
Oct 2017,50,FUN IN THE SUN,"Had fab stay in hotel.  Was on Paul Claffey Country Music Week.   Staff and hotel were great.  stayed in apartments, and had hotel provided a  buggy, to get us back to apartment.   First time visiting hotel, but going back next year."
Oct 2017,50,Costa Del Folk,The Jigantics playing Costa Del Folk and we were looked after very well.The hotel definitely deserves its 5 star rating. Food excellent and the location to the beach is really easy to get to. Very clean and lovely to walk along. Hope we are back sometime
Oct 2017,20,Dancing @ music ,"Great to be back in ireland after one week in this hotel it was very poor for a 5star the bed was just a wooden box with mattress  on top ,The smell in room of damp ?.the carpets was dirty stains very bad , Breafast was poor not hot at eny time ,we did not eat at the evening as we had a look at it and we was not impressed so we had meal at night out , sorry to say we will not be returning we have been on the music weeks with Paul claffey tours for years this is the worst hotel every sorry to say"
Oct 2017,40,Event Week,"Very nice hotel, unfortunately their main restaurants had closed for the season so we had to eat out in the evenings after our week of entertainment. If we'd known this prior to booking we wouldn't have stayed so long and just taken the advertised 1 week trip with Paul Claffey tours."
Oct 2017,50,Holiday )ct 2017,"We really enjoyed our stay with your hotel. It is our third year. Check in was superb this year and the rooms were ready when we arrived. I have to say your staff are excellent, friendly and most of all trust worthy, which is something I like. We will be back."
Oct 2017,50,Wonderful holiday,"Fabulous apartment, very spacious for the two of us. Well maintained. The resort grounds are lovely and you feel straight at home.The staff are so helpful nothing is too much problem.Will be going back there no doubt about it!"
Oct 2017,50,Fairy hill,"Stayed here for 8 days. Excellent staff,  friendly, courteous  and hardworking. Rooms very spacious.  Food and service excellent. Variety of places to eat all with great views and within walking distance to beach for early morning walks.  Would highly recommend this hotel"
Oct 2017,30,Certainly not 5 star,"Staying here for Costa Del Folk run by Enjoy Travel who are a fantastic company and well done to them for sorting out flights after the collapse of Monarch Airlines. They are fantastic at the festival and can't fault their service.  None of these comments are directed at Enjoy but at the hotel, Room spacious and great sea view but don't really like carpet in a hot country and the carpet is dirty and stained and the shower is pretty rubbish.Not 5 star.  Breakfast is OK but no egg chef for omelettes etc; which you normally get in Portugal or Spain in a 3 star; unbelievable in 5 star! Typical buffet dinner but 1st night in the inside restaurant food was cold and no live cooking which is normal in a 3 or 4 star.Unexpected bonus was free drinks with dinner, alcoholic or not and the waiters were very good serving us water, wine and beer. Next night managed to get an outside table and the food in the containers was much hotter. But.... the tall waiter who seemed to be in charge was awful and seemed to resent people getting drinks either soft or alcoholic. It was busy and many people were asking for drinks so it made sense to to give them a decent measure I asked for ages for water and when he finally came I got a third of  a small glass and small wine.  Because it took so long to get a drink I asked for a larger glass of wine and water but he said I had to finish the one I had first. We finished our mains and on asking for another drink he asked if we had finished eating as if he couldn't serve us: we had.'t even gone for deserts!! Other people were also trying to get a drink without success!! The other waiter was giving people decent glasses of wine and water!! This waiter's attitude made me feel very uncomfortable and quite upset when I left especially when the rest of the hotel staff have been fantastic and very helpful Also I have never ever been in a hotel (especially 5 star) that doesn't have ice cream at dinner. I live in Spain and often saty in hotels and ice cream is standard in a 3 star hotel."
Oct 2017,50,Dream come through,"Our stay at the Grande Real Sante Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa was a dream come beginning to end, from the Staff, Service, Accommodation, Food, Comfort Location to Location. I highly recommend the Hotel and will definitely be back for out fifth visit soon."
Oct 2017,40,Hooley in the sun  first time visit,Amazing hotel  very clean  well run  Top marks to the cleaning staff  who came to our apartments   Really polite  and courteous 👏👏Bad lay out for breakfast ...toaster in wrong place which caused  big delays Food  some times looked tired and like it had layed there for hours
Oct 2017,50,Paul Claffey Music Tour.,"My stay was excellent. From arriving, reception staff friendly&helpful. Food great, suggest omelettes by Carla for breakfast superb. Function room & jiggy jiggy staff interaction with guests fantastic. Overall top marks for service given to all 700 guests. You deserve a Gold star!"
Oct 2017,50,Great for babies,"We have 8 month twins , cots were there ready. We had a room on ground floor close to the pool with everything we needed! Staff were lovely and really made effort! Would recomend to anyone with children! Lovely clean pool and enough shade to keep babies out of sun"
Oct 2017,50,Great stay,We had a great stay here. With our 1 yr old daughter. Great apartments and good service. Spectacular beach front  Nothing but praise for this place and great value for money. Surely recommend this place for families.
Oct 2017,50,Very nice hotel,Hotel was really nice and would definitely return.. was near the strip of bars and then just a short bus ride to the old town which is really nice! my only comment would be that the spa treatment prices are a bit too much.. other than that really nice hotel!
Oct 2017,40,Lovely hotel . Large and abs spotless,Beautiful hotel and service great. Food at breakfast was abs fine. Super clean pool areas and all areas of hotel. Bar was a bit expensive... Courtesy bus to Albufeira got full very quickly leaving people with babies to hire a taxi. The bus could have ran throughout the day.
Oct 2017,50,Week in the Algarve ,"We stayed in the Algarve for one week at this fabulous resort. Initially we thought to use it as a base from which to explore Portugal's sunny southern region. The resort was so lovely we ended up spending 3 days lounging around the pool, walking the beach and getting some rest and relaxation. The resort is centrally located, so day trips to the interior, Faro and Sagres were easy to do. We did have our own rental car, but there were many tours to choose from. The staff were warm and welcoming. Never intrusive but very helpful if you requested something. The hotel was very clean, beds were comfortable and the rooms were generously proportioned. We had a lovely patio outside our room which was great to sit out and enjoy a drink. We did have a view of the ocean but it was partially obstructed. Booking rooms in the upper floors is recommended if that is important to you.We ate at the restaurants (there are four) on site and the food and service was very good. We would have preferred more selection for dinner options as there were only two restaurants open for dinner, but going into Albufeira was not a problem and there was much to choose from in town."
Oct 2017,40,very nice property on an amazing beach,"Spent 5 nights at this hotel in late September.  The rooms was nice with a balcony, and fridge, though would have preferred a sea view.  Very clean and modern, though how about replacing the carpets with a hard surface flooring??..Courteous service including chocolate on bed each day!  Buffet breakfast and buffet dinner very good with lots of selection.  Pools and deck great for sunbathing.  Beach is long and sandy with chairs and umbrellas to rent.  Water in the ocean was cold but still swimable.  High red cliffs surround the beach.  Enjoyed the spa for a massage.  Grounds were well kept on the whole, but the front of the hotel could use some gardening tlc as lots of weeds.  The adjacent apartments had grounds that were very well groomed etc.  The food in the bar restaurant was uninspired and actuallybelow standard in terms of presentation and taste. it's hard to go wrong with natchos and a burger but they managed to do so.."
Oct 2017,50,Fantastic resort,"Great hotel, thoroughly enjoyed our stay, fantastic location, with stunning views & direct access to beach. great restaurants, fish restaurant with open fire grill was amazing although a little pricey. Superb buffet breakfast"
Oct 2017,30,Room for improvement,"A lot of room for improvement, especially considering this hotel has a5-star rating.Facilities and location were very good.Excellent breakfast choice and quality.Staff appeared demotivated and they lack training. A lot of them seemed unhappy and it was hard to get a smile or even a greeting. More understanding towards children and their needs.Entertaining should be more consistent and more variety (a few nights the performances were cancelled and games rooms closed even though we were there in Sep).Dinner must improve, considering this hotel is 5* and price paid.Apartment was spacious and comfortable, although it needs a bit of TLC and updating."
Oct 2017,50,Fabulous resort,"We stayed end of September , staff and hotel was fantastic  near a beautiful beach , breakfasts were superb,  lovely room with a beautiful sea .The weather was beautiful throughout our holiday .Would definitely return to Grande Real .Thank  you for everything"
Oct 2017,50,Fabulous Mini break with friends,Just had a wonderful few days here with friends. The weather was perfect. The position of the hotel is wonderful right on the beach. We stayed bed and breakfast  .The breakfast was great. Everything you could want. Even cava. Hotel is spotlessly clean  and the staff are charming. We will be back. Thankyou
Oct 2017,50,Excellent family hotel with everything you need.,"This hotel was perfect for our first family holiday. We had a studio apartment which had everything we needed & had breakfast in the hotel which was excellent. Staff are so friendly & helpful. The lady that cleaned our room was so nice & was so mindful of waking the baby! Our room was overlooking the pool area but we used the pools at the main hotel as one if them is heated. Great atmosphere, lots of families. We did eat in the burger restaurant which was nice but you pay a little bit more however the terrace is lovely with beautiful views out to sea. Would recommend & would like to stay again in this lovely hotel!"
Oct 2017,50,Beautiful hotel and great staff,"My husband and I stayed for 10 nights and 10 very relaxing days. From the moment we arrived the staff were very friendly and welcoming. Our room was perfect, clean and we loved the blackout curtains, normally we are up from 6am, but some mornings on holiday it was 8 due to quietness and comfort. Breakfast was fantastic everyday, but we were not so keen when the staff started to direct you to a table, to avoid this and the queue do get down early. The poolside is brilliant and so peaceful with fantastic views over the beach/sea. We were delighted with the additional towels that the hotel supplied and really appreciated that you collect a fresh one daily.We found now faults at GRSE and will definitely return, only thing I would recommend is to take your own transfer,our bus took 1hr20 mins"
Oct 2017,40,Based on a B &B stay in an apartment in the hotel grounds.,Apartments were very clean and well kitted out but not quite in the same 5 star class as the main hotel. A quiete location away from the main centre of Albufeira with a lovely beach and lots of on site facilities. Family friendly. Buffet breakfast very good with large selection. Evening buffet worth a try but plenty of other restaurants in Albufeira .Be prepared to use taxis or hire car as shuttle bus to / from Albufeira does not run into late evening.
Oct 2017,50,hotel,"hotel was lovely. however would have liked tea/coffee facilities in the room. also in the washrooms downstairs the mens hand dryers were not working, would have liked a clock by the pool. liked  the fact there was a bus that took us into town and was plenty of resteurants to choose from. likes the pool although one of the pools was very cold"
Oct 2017,50,Faultless,"Been here before, the hotel is faultless, great with kids , the manager sorts any problems straight away.  The staff are so friendly and helpful.  The guys on the beach with the Jet Skis were great with my 23month old helping him on with his dad."
Oct 2017,50,A fantastic holiday experience,First impressions were very good. A pleasant and informative welcome from the reception staff which included an offer of an upgrade on our booked accommodation. The accommodation was first class with the garden terrace opening out  towards the swimming pool.  The daily room service was excellent and is to be commended. We thoroughly enjoyed this our first holiday at the Grand Real Santa Eulalia which will not be our last
Oct 2017,50,Excellent hotel,"The reception and all staff were top class, plenty sun beds , food was excellence   especially the restaurant served lunches, the only down side was the evening and day time entertainer which was not worth watching  one evening there was 6 guests watching the  ""show ""out of maybe 200 guests.stayingthe shuttle bus to the town worked well.Would we go back certainly"
Oct 2017,50,What a view,"This is an ideal location to stay. Just outside Oura. Fantastic staff, rooms, food, views. We are going back. A short walk down the steps to the lovely beach. The pool area was very clean and they had a nice bar service."
Oct 2017,50,Hotel Review,"We have had a wonderful time at the hotel and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Enjoyed the rooms, the food, the location, the beach, the spar, the bars, the reception guys for all their help and Of course, the free shuttle service to the old town!!"
Oct 2017,20,"Poor Customer Service, Over priced accomodations, Unfortunate Beach Management","I stayed here with my wife for our honeymoon.  The compound itself was nice, however not a single staff member showed an ounce of care when handling our questions, requests, etc.  Specifically, one member of the staff at the beach bar rolled her eyes at us every time we made a request.  I asked her for a simple bag of ice and she acted like I was insulting her.  She couldnt be bothered.  The food was poor at best, and way over priced.  Additionally, it was unfortunate that your hotel does not manage the beach and chairs.  To pay 15 euros simply to sit on a chair is outrageous.  This may be customary, however, we felt that our experience was hampered by the fact we were giving money away just to sit on a beach chair.The towel card policy is stupid, when the live music would be cancelled there was no notification.  Shuttles were cancelled with notification only in the form of a small sign at the front desk.  How would I know a shuttle is cancelled if I didnt go to the desk to find out?  The shuttles should have run later than 720pm.  This is just a scam to partner with cabs and make money for them.  The staff would only provide recommendations that were located in Old Town and New Town.  As someone who travelled very far for a good experience, I would have hoped that your staff would offer some options outside of the tourist trap where every single restaurant had the same exact bland menu and overly aggressive staffers pulling you into their restaurant.Lastly, and while not a major issue but would have been nice, your staff could care less that we were on honeymoon.  We shared this with multiple staffers in the hopes that maybe they would stop treating us so poorly, but not one person cared about that.Outside of the location which I believed through my research was good(and now dont believe so knowing that I would not want to go to old town and new town ever again) I would not recommend this hotel based on the above as well as some additional frustrations.Paying to sit on a beach on our honeymoon and being treated poorly by your staff were primary concerns, but only one layer of issues."
Oct 2017,50,Amazing Resort with excellent Beach,Stayed at the Grande Real apartments for 5 days last week and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The location was perfect and the beach was just a short walk from the rooms. Always managed to find a decent spot in the beach no matter what time of the day we went. The apartment was cleaned everyday during our stay which was very nice. We arrived a bit late for the check-in but faced no problems as it was all ready for us when we came in. Got a free late check out as well (until about 2.30pm) which was a life saver as the little one wanted to take a nap that afternoon! There is still room for improvement though - Kids Club - even though the temperature was decent (mid 20's) it was quite warm inside the club. With the sun beating down on the play area it would have been helpful to have the inside more cooler. In fact considering the place gets an average of 3000 hours of sun shine a year it would be good if the management can put some sort of cover for the play ground to help the children through the heat. Swimming pools - probably due to the low season it was not very full. Most of the crowd inside the pool were with kids and all of them used the heated pool. It might be a good idea to have all the kids pool heated too. Used room service once and was good. But there are lots of restaurants nearby if you wish to fancy them. Also it would be good if they changed the decor of the apartments and made sure the curtains covered the windows well and let very minimal light through. Had to use a dustbin to hold the curtains in the bedroom in place so it would cover the entire window!Will certainly return if we wanted to go to Algarve again but would advise against visiting during the peak season as I am sure the pool will be quite crowded.
Oct 2017,30,Definitely not 5-star quality,"I guess it's a nice hotel for families but I would certainly give it a miss if you are friends or couples. It definitely isn't a 5-star quality hotel. It might tick the boxes for the things you need to have to be a 5-star hotel, but it definitely lacked the 5-star mentality. Pools are small and there are A LOT OF KIDS!! We went in Sept and they had closed the bar/resto at the other pool area because it was out of season... although the hotel was booked out?!The mattress cover has a plastic coating and was MOST uncomfortable. Every time you moved you could hear the plastic rustling. I've NEVER had that in a hotel before, let alone a 5-star one!!!You are only allowed one towel per person. What's THAT all about?!?No concierge - 5-star?!?!?!Staff weren't overly helpful in recommendations. Food was OK... food for the massesLocation was a bit out of town, which was good for me because town is a little crazy. Only 8-10 euros (including tip) taxi ride.Overall I felt like a number. The hotel was just a place to lay my head."
Oct 2017,50,Idyllic hotel and location,"From start to finish we enjoyed a wonderful holiday here. Service, location, food, ambience.....everything was wonderful. Go for a room overlooking the sea if you can. Beach was lovely and never crowded. Would recommend Atlantico Restaurant and bar overlooking the beach. The only negative things I could say was that our bed was extremely hard but that's personal preference and that all the bars and restaurants including Le Club weren't open during our stay but this did not detract from our enjoyment. Will definitely be returning."
Oct 2017,50,Fantastic,Our stay at GRSE was as fantastic as ever. We have been coming here for the last 6 years and also got married in the hotel and our expectations have never failed! We had our 2 children with us (2& 7 months) and it was so well equipped for them also.  The only thing I might recommend that the rooms are a bit dated(never dirty) interior wise and they could do with an overhaul and also it would be very handy to have washing machine facilities at apartments side!
Oct 2020,30,Disappointing,"I was moved to this hotel as the one I had booked was closed for Covid 19. With it being 5 star I expected the best. Sadly, this hotel is more like a 3-star in terms of comfort and facilities.Here are the shortcomings:Two tiny outdoor pools with hardly any space to swim. So disappointing.Doors bang shut when guests come and go.They put me in a room with a balcony overlooking the car park. Needless to say I did not use the balcony!All guests during Covid put in same corridor meaning a lot of noise. Guests should have been spread out as hotel was almost empty.Thin walls in rooms meaning I was frequently disturbed by people in next room talking.Breakfast service was uncoordinated and inefficient. Breakfast was poor for a five-star establishment. Bread and croissants not fresh at all. Hot food mediocre. No menu so I had to guess regarding what was on offer. Orange juice was excellent. Coffee average.Kids allowed to run around, approach guests and scream during breakfast.Hole in towel.( See photo)You pay extra for everything. I could not use the indoor pool or spa because you pay extra for this! The original hotel I had booked (their sister hotel) would have allowed me to use the indoor pool facilities for free but in this place you pay extra for everything.Noise is someone dragging things along the floor every afternoon on floor 3. This disturbed me immensely in my room on floor 2.Shower facility in room was like that of a 2-star hotel. Just a shower in a bath that you stand in. Water pressure pretty poor.Room decor was acceptable but the curtains were hideous.It was October and the heating did not work in my room. A technician had to come to switch it on! Why was it not on in the first place?Positives:WiFi goodBBC1 availableEasy access to beachFairly genuine welcome on arrivalBed quite comfortableOrange juice good"
Oct 2020,50,Lovely Hotel,"Stunning hotel in an amazing location. All the staff were helpful and friendly and food was varied and delicious. The spa is wonderful also.It was very quiet which is a real shame however all staff were very attentive and friendly, and the hotel worked out ways to accommodate all needs even with certain areas closed. I just wish the pillows were bigger."
Sep 2020,50,Beautiful hotel,"This was our first holiday during the pandemic. We booked our holiday about 9 days before we left.Our flights we booked direct with Ryanair and the hotel through Expedia.We were able to get a direct flight from Aberdeen to Faro and the flight is just over 3 hours.What to expect at Aberdeen Airport.  At the time of writing this the only things that were open was Duty Free and The Tippling House restaurant. The airport felt very safe and there wasn't a lot of passengers going about even with two flights leaving at the same time.Our flight was about 80% full.  They are still serving food and drink on the plane.  You are not allowed to wait in line for the toilet.  You have to press your buzzer to let the air steward know that you need the toilet, they take a note of your seat number and let you know when the toilet is available.  Which worked well.At Faro Airport they will ask you take your mask off at passport control then you put it back on.  They never asked for the passenger locator form that we filled out. Getting through Faro airport was very quick we were out and cleared within 15 minutes.We took a taxi to the hotel which cost less than 50 euros.You can either turn left or right when you leave the hotel and there is plenty of restaurants, bars, pharmacy and supermarket.We stayed in room 108 which was clean, comfortable and spacious room which looked onto the beach.  In the room you given two bottles of water if you want more water then you can order it through room service.  There is a coffee machine.  There is also toilletories in the room.  You can also get your room cleaned daily.  We just hung the sign outside the room. There is a hairdryer in the room. Breakfast is served from 8am to 11am.  You are taken to your table and served a continental breakfast but you can also order a cooked breakfast.  The food was delicious.There is 3 swimming pools.  The sun beds are santized. You are given two cards when you check in to collect your towels at the pool.There is a pool bar where you can order food and drinks.People don't wear masks when there sun bathing but do wear them when there walking about.There is a steakhouse. We didn't eat here but we did enjoy watching the sunset here.There is the Atlantis restaurant which us located on the beach.  You can't charge anything to your room from this restaurant. But all other bars and restaurants you can charge to your room.We ate at this restaurant 3 nights in row.  The food was delicious.Also when you check in you are given a key card to access the beach.You can hire a sun lounger on the beach which cost 10 euros.The beach is beautiful. The beach is not sectioned off for social distancing and people are not wearing masks.I would recommend this hotel."
Sep 2020,50,Incredible hotel with perfect ocean views,A great hotel right by the beach. The outdoor pool is great and we loved the ocean views from our balcony over the ocean.The staff is extremely kind and always ready to help.We had dinner with friends at their Steakhouse and we truly loved it. Delicious food and the sunset views over the ocean was probably the highlight of our stay.Highly recommended hotel.
Sep 2020,50,Great stay by the beach,"We stayed at Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort for 2 nights and we love it! They have an amazing outside pool perfect to sunbathe and relax during those hot summer days. The beach is located right in front of the hotel and we could see it from our balcony. There's plenty of restaurants by the beach  but our favourite was the steakhouse restaurant located at the hotel. We had one of the best meals  ever, the meat was very tender and juicy and the chocolate caramel mousse was the simply amazing. We loved our time here  and we can't wait to be back again."
Sep 2020,50,Excellent Holiday,"We were moved to this hotel by our holiday company as our original one was not available for some reason.We were not disappointed. This hotel was excellent. On arrival we were allocated a ground floor room which i did not fancy and asked if we could have a higher floor, no problem as the staff at reception fixed it for us in minutes. All the staff took the Covid rules in a very professional manner so no worries here. Every one we came into contact with were very pleasant and nothing was too much trouble for anything we needed. A big thank you to them all.  I did like the idea of going for breakfast, sitting at your table and the staff fetch anything you want, Brilliant service, food was excellent. We did go to the beach club and found the private beach a big bonus. However just a bit of advice to newcomers you do have to pay for the sun beds. It costs 10 Euro for half a day or 20 Euro for a full day! Nice little earner if you have fifty beds!! All the staff again at the club were very efficient and friendly. Hotel is spotless which is a credit to all the staff involved. Thanks again."
Sep 2020,30,The closest to the beach you will get,"What I loved in this hotel was that it was really close to the beach with easy access if you have kids or elderly people traveling with you. If this is important for You, then this is the best hotel in all Algarve for it. All other hotels are more Distant to the beach or have lots of stairs to access the beach. Another great thing is that they serve food and drinks in the sand if you rent some chairs. The service and the food are just ok (don't expect a 5 star service), with little variety and everything is a little bit outdated (what is ok for me)."
Sep 2020,30,Hotel in good location but some issues. ,"We were in the self catering rooms which were a bit dated.  The hotel is in need of some renovation .Some issues with staff service  who appear to forget they work in a 5 Star hotel. I particularly did not like being told to get a towel myself from the other pool some distance away, when stocks were exhausted despite there being a phone beside this attendant. And having just walked from there as there were no sun beds. Not enough sun beds or towel placement control round the main pool at all. When numbers in the hotel declined this week beds were then removed making the situation no better. Room not cleaned on last day, yes mistakes can happen but we called at 6.0pm and were told an hour later a cleaner would attend while we were out. Returning at 11pm no room clean and had to call for fresh towels. Service in all bar areas slow and having to repeatedly ask for service, or bills is not good. Covid controls very good and all staff adhering. Health suite staff excellent. The hotel is in a great location but falling short of 5 star status unfortunately."
Sep 2020,50,Perfect break despite difficult times.,We are coming to the end of our week here. We felt anxious about travelling but needed a break. This is a quality hotel. We had a sea view room. Spacious and well equipped. The hotel is ideally positioned on the beach. Pool areas lovely. I also paid a small fee to enjoy the amazing spa pool- pre booked and only me there. We are on full board. The lunches by the sea are excellent particularly the fish and the breakfast and dinners in the restaurant also. I particularly wanted to post now to say how impressed we are by the hotels response to the current situation. The staff are meticulous in wearing masks and keeping everywhere and everything spotlessly clean and disinfected. We feel safe and will cared for. Thank you we hope to visit again when masks aren’t needed.
Aug 2020,20,Ok but the worst 5 star hotel I’ve visited ,"Slow expensive room service, rubbish cleaning and lots of excuses things were closed due to the dreaded. I’m sorry but at this price you expect a shower post check out and a decent cocktail. The staff were friendly but I’m sorry €12 for an sandwich on rubbish bread"
Jul 2020,40,Family holidays,"Very nice hotel with an excellent service in restaurants and bars. The rooms, in your case, the suite was clean only the air conditioning is from time to time no working very good. Pools are very nice also the beach is only a step away. The animation is very excellent."
Apr 2020,40,family holiday,recently visited this hotel. with location being key we loved it. private beach access & within walking distance to beautiful restaurants  The only disappointing factor about this holiday was of course the corona virus was hitting portugal & places were going into lockdownTo us where the hotel fell down was lack of information they started closing down the hotel bit by bit without notifying the guests. Rooms stopped being cleaned. Had to go to reception to replace towels & get toilet roll etc. Spa was closed kids club closed beach bar had reduced hours.As I said all of this was happening around us with no communication from Hotel Mgt. This is not what you would expect from a five star hotel. I work as a travel consultant and I would be very upset if I had sent clients to this hotel to be treated in this manner  Obviously all was done for the staff & guests welfare but communicate to your guests. We had travelled fm Ireland  Saturday to Saturday & by Wednesday we were.looking for flights to go home as the reception staff weren't able to tell us of the hotel was going into lockdown & if we would be able to stay till the end of our stay. We were travelling with 2 children so needed some reassurance which we never received. I would love to visit this.hotel again & for them to prove ot is a 5 star.
Apr 2020,50,Our 3rd Visit for winter holidays,"My Wife and myself along with two friend returned here in Febuary 2020 we stay in the aparments in the grounds of the hotel.Thanks to the hotel staff we have had apartmeny 591 on each visit,but slight problem with damp in bedroom wardropes,we did imform the hotel on our last visit,not a big problem we used wardrope in other room.Shower gel and hairdryer in bathroom,small kitchen great for self catering everything you nice even dressing gowns.We all enjoy walking so we are out most days the weather this year was reaaly hot for the time of year,hotel right on the beach,great beach bar over looking the bay.Lots of pools around between apartments and main pool is heated,beautiful paceful place,,we will return,,Enjoy the geordies"
Mar 2020,40,Holiday,Enjoyed our stay which was interrupted by ther coronavirus infection which caused us to not take tours and move about freely.  Since this has nothing to do with our stay at your holiday which was very enjoyable certainly would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a lovely place to stay while on vcacation.
Mar 2020,50,Great hotel but Virus shut most things down!,"We were part of a group package for a longstay in this splendid property. For the first two weeks we enjoyed the grounds, the fun shuttle to town, our wonderful self-catering apt, the fabulous beach, the pool, the views, the great staff at reception and the brilliant staff and ambience of the Atlantico where the female servers were so friendly and capable-thanks Sara and Loiza and all the rest.When the virus fears hit all of Europe, we were quickly left without. Tour Manager and service after service shut down( understandably). Going home was a series of missteps and changes. We wonder if the hotel might have communicated a little more and offered some special take-out options. To be fair, this was a new experience for all and our memories of thenhotel staff are very positive,"
Mar 2020,50,very nice stay in the resort,"very friendly people, many thanks for the big surprise you granted me at the occasion of my birthday one week after arrival, especially remarkable and very usefull is the shuttle-bus-service to New Town and Old Town"
Mar 2020,50,wonderful trip,"This hotel is lovely for staying on holiday, it's near the sea and very silent, for people who search a good service is it excellent, we will stay again in the next time, you must have a car, because the hotel is outside"
Mar 2020,50,Hard to please,"We spent 5 nights at out new home from home. Honestly Grande Real Santa Eulalia is a great hotel, excellent  location and with great facilities. Right on the beach and amazing pool area. My partner and I stayed in a sea view room with a terrace. We had breakfast every morning which was excellent value for money.Staff all very friendly and helpful. Rooms very clean and cleaners are in every day even on days we're we wanted to chill in our rooms they came later to clean. Towels are provided for the pool area so no need to bring towels with you. As someone who isn’t easily impressed. At first sight, my partner and I were impressed with how stunningly beautiful the resort was. But we’re both on reserve on a few things. I told him my initial impression was a 7 out of 10 and he was a little on the fence and scored his initial at 5. Within moments of going through our luggage and discovering missing items we soon increased our scores to 8 leaving room for improvement. From the moment we woke up the following morning to the day we checked out it was safe to say the scores remained a firm 9. We would’ve scored a 10 but I’m hoping to experience this on my next visit. Well done to the Amazing front of house team (who genuinely look like they enjoy their job and working with each other), cleaning ladies (who were always so friendly and said hello in the hallways) and lastly the breakfast team, two of which really stood out for us. Caita Mota and Mario Lurking made breakfast enjoyable every morning.  I took the time to personally take down their names as they were both consistently warm and engaging with us. I will most certainly be staying at this resort every time I visit Portugal."
Mar 2020,50,Wonderfully relaxed,"My husband and I booked this hotel through a tour operator as a last-minute bargain and what a bargain we got! It's a really lovely hotel. Staff are fantastic and nothing is too much trouble for them. We had a one-bed apartment on the grounds and it was very spacious and spotlessly clean. We booked breakfast only meal plan which was a full buffet. There is direct access to a beautiful, quiet beach. We were there at the beginning of March so it might not be quite so quiet during the summer period :-)"
Mar 2020,50,Luxurious and stress-free babymoon,"We visited early March. The weather was sunny and perfect, so we could enjoy the swimmingpools and the beach at the hotel. The hotel, appartments, pools and beach are all very beautiful and clean. It was low season, so we enjoyed a quiet stay without the mass tourism. All the employees were very friendly The appartment/studio was lovely, the beds very good."
Mar 2020,50,Amazing stay at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia,Amazing hotel with great quality of breakfast. Staff all very friendly and helpful. Rooms very clean and cleaners are in every day. Towels provided for the pool area so no need to bring towels with you. Overall a brilliant stay and cant wait to go back again!
Mar 2020,50,Lydia from Canada,Great location and facility. Right on the beach and amazing pool area. Easy access to historical excursions   Accessible to town with free bus service. Apartments and hotel rooms so meet the needs of family and singles. Great breakfast   Excellent value for money. Free parking and can walk to restaurants and grocery shopping out of complex. Stayed for 2 weeks and no complaints at all. Staff in all areas accommodating
Mar 2020,50,Five-Star Luxury in Abufeira,"The Grand Real St. Eulalia has a stunning beach location just east of the town, with great ambience and friendly, very professional staff. We stayed for the month of February in the self-catering apartment complex of two-story 'fisherman's houses' set in attractive, quiet laneways with their own pools and easy access to local restaurant and attractions. The hotel provides a full range of concierge services, and made excellent arrangements for tours, excursions and restaurant reservations. We had a wonderful month and can't wait to return!"
Mar 2020,50,Winter Sunshine,"Excellent stay with requested Seaview room without charge. Birthday celebration acknowledged with cake and bubbly delivered to room. Excellent breakfast choices staying on B and B option. Enjoyed evening meal also at extra charge at 29euro per person, nice for special occasion. Excellent direct beach access location. Overall Excellent value and would not hesitate to return another time."
Mar 2020,50,What a beautiful place!,"I felt welcome from the moment I walked in, my room got upgraded, which was also really really nice (though my suite was now so big I don't even think I used half of it!).Lovely location with a beautiful beach and quite a few pools!"
Mar 2020,50,Brilliant,"We had a great time here our little boy loved the heated outdoor pool and the playground area, the breakfast is phenomenal and their dinners are delicious too, would highly recommend staying here, we stayed here as a couple last year also so our return visit says it all, the staff are very friendly and welcoming and helpful"
Mar 2020,50,Excellent facility,"We thoroughly enjoyed our month at the Grand Eulália. Staff were always pleasant , polite and very helpful. Our apartment was excellent and very clean. Shuttle service was reliable and dependable. We would come back in a minute and will highly so we had our meals elsewhere. We would highly  recommend the facility to friends. The only complaint we have is the quality of the food at the hotel. We were not impressed but the food and service at the beach cafe was superb. Our vacation in Portugal and our stay at the Grand EULÁLIA was one of the best we have ever had. The entire facility is immaculate and service from all employees was prompt. Your employees are very polite and helpful . A wonderful experience for both of us.Jim and Joan Moore."
Mar 2020,50,Highly Recommended,"We stayed for 1 week as a newly wed holiday with my wife and our little son. The hotel has a great location in Albufeira, with a beautiful beach in front. You can reach the old town easily as they provide a free shuttle bus several times a day. Facilities and accommodation are very good.I can make 2 recommendations for improvement: our room had some walls cracked opposite the bath probably from old humidity. A new wall painting will lift its look. In the main restaurant during the dinner some of the foods are served in pots or pans. You have to lift the lids and so every guest will do so which is not hygienic. Moreover those lids you have to put somewhere around while you help yourself thus damaging the while covers around. The standard practice in restaurants of this class is to have warming tools with small flames underneath which should keep the pots warm but without the need for lids. Alternatively some staff serving from them. My sound minor but these days is a matter of hygiene Our trip was lovely and the staff worked hard every day. Thank you."
Mar 2020,40,Nice Hotel,"Very friendly staff, apartment was clean but could do with a little updating. As could the decking around the pools, would rate this 4* not 5*. I would return to this hotel again out of season. Could do with a few less steps down to the beach as this was difficult with a buggy. Was a bit of a walk to the nearest supermarket that’s open this time of year, all local restaurants were closed, would be good if this is mentioned and then maybe some better deals to include food with a room only booking, as this did turn a cheap stay into a more expensive one."
Mar 2020,50,"Excellent hotel,food and staff","Excellent service and quality,good food friendly and helpful staff very clean the rooms and the rest of the hotel the beach is cleaned regularly also the buss who takes you to albufeira is a very good idea I will definitely return and recommend the hotel AAA++++++"
Mar 2020,40,SHORT STAY,Hotel was clean and on the beach. No tea or coffee in room.Our room was a bit dated and in shade nearly all day. Bed was excellent size. A few extra touches needed before been a 5 star hotel.But all in all a good hotel and excellent beach location
Mar 2020,10,I wish I had known.,"Just going to do bullet points . . *Nothing much going on* No onsite shop , nearest 1 a good 15 minute walk , not good with a toddler* Beautiful views* beach nice* Staff at Atlantico Surely dont smile or even react to you .* Maids good , rooms cleaned daily* 15 minute walk to nearest civilisation * Rooms need updating,  good luck self catering dont even get any pans, but there was a hand blender !* beds quite hard * not many of the onsite restaurants open out of season."
Mar 2020,40,our family stay in santa eulalia,"we had a great stay, 6 days of sun shine (not very common for this time of year), we loved to have lunch at the beach bar, the Atlantico salad here is fabulous (fresh shrimps and great cocktail sauce). Also for the kids they have nice food options. Too bad that there is no indoor swimming pool available for kids (the one at the spa is only for adults). Outside there is one heated pool which is still a bit cold when the temperatures are around 18-20 degrees with wind. The girls had a great time though. The breakfast was also great, lots of choice, and fresh fruit (juice)! The chairs in the restaurant were not that comfortable and some were unstable. If you have doubts about where to go for dinner, ask the reception staff. We went to two of their suggestions and had a great experience and good food."
Mar 2020,30,Not a 5 Star,This is not a 5 star hotel. I spend around 120 to 130 nights a year in 4 and 5 star hotels all over the world so feel I am able to recognise a proper 5 star hotel.The rooms are a good size but need a refurb. Beds are very hard which may suit some people. They have a crazy system with tea and coffee in the rooms. You get a kettle and a few tea/coffee bags on arrival but no milk. Milk can be bought from the bar at 2 euros a small jug. Once you have used your tea / coffee bags you have to buy replacements !!!The breakfast selection is quite good but the hot items are never more than just warm. The evening buffet is overpriced at 29 euros per person and again the hot items were never more than luke warm.I suppose as a holiday hotel it is OK provided you did not spend too much on your room.It does offer a variety of sports facilities.
Mar 2020,30,NOT A REAL 5 STAR HOTEL,This 5 star hotel seems poorly maintaine. Poroblem with the air conditioning and refrigerator.in our room. No ice cube facility having to ask at the bar for ice cubes and get in a small glass instead of what it should be in a bucket for a 5 star hotel. Only one complementary bottle of water. Only 2 coffee packages in the room that are not replaced each day unless I pay; room not well cleaned until I complained. Bathroom sink a bit damaged. Elevators doors worn and seem dirty. ALL I ALL DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A 5 STAR HOTEL.
Mar 2020,50,Fabulous Hotel,"Thank you for a wonderful weekend spent looking at wedding venue. WE will be booking another stay very soon.Great location and beautiful facilities, Staff wonderful. Wedding planner gave great information. We have booked my sons wedding for May 2021."
Mar 2020,50,Wedding booking,Had a wonderful stay and was fully satisfied with services provided and like it so much we booked our wedding here. My partner and I took our parents here and every single one of us thoroughly enjoyed it.
Mar 2020,40,4 night stay,"Great hotel in lovely beach side location. Friendly efficient helpful staff, comfy beds. Too cold to swim in sea or unheated pools at this time of year, only one outdoor pool was heated and it was small. Would be better if another outdoor pool was also heated. Spa pool felt overpriced considering the temperature, it could have been much warmer.Otherwise a great stay!"
Mar 2020,50,Vantage beach location,"Great hotel for a relaxing break, good food, lovely front desk reception staff (very helpful), decent gym & amenities, not too far from restaurants & town centre, ample free parking. Would visit again"
Feb 2020,50,Great hotel for families with kids!,"The hotel has everything you need to keep your child entertained for a week. Staff were very kind and helpful. Albufeira itself is not the most beautiful town in Portugal, but the hotel has everything you need, and therefore you can have a great holiday just sticking to the area around the hotel."
Feb 2020,40,Fine,Please make the water in second piscine so warm as the other!Please be more clear about the price of coffee/thee/water in the room!Please show the prices of the restaurant on a brochure in the room.
Feb 2020,50,Excellent hotel,"Enjoyed a lovely week here during February half term with my 2 daughters and my mum. We had a one bedroom apartment with sofa bed in the lounge. The one bedroom apartments are all on the ground floor. I requested to be as close as possible to the main building as my mum has walking difficulties. This was honored and made a big difference to our stay. The site is huge so worth requesting this if needed. I agree with some of the other reviews that the decor is slightly dated, but this is only in style rather than state of repair. I personally loved the brightly decorated rooms. Who cares if it's not the latest style! The apartment was spotless and cleaned daily unless you put up the 'do not disturb'. It's not 5 star by UK standards but you are still comfortable in clean and pleasant surroundings and I had no complaints. We had a little patio with table and chairs and clothes airer. This overlooked the car park but the grounds are planted with such lovely trees and plants that it was no issue. We were able to watch little birds and other wildlife from our patio.All the staff we encountered were so pleasant and helpful and we felt very welcome. The breakfast is out of this world! So much choice and all so fresh and delicious! We didn't eat at the hotel at other times so can't comment on that. We enquired about the evening buffet but at €30 a head we gave it a miss! We ordered in takeaways through Uber Eats and Gato Gordo and I met them outside the main building. This worked well and were always delivered on time and with a smile. We also cooked in the apartment. All utensils were there but we could have done with a peeler! We noticed on the last day that the microwave was in fact a combi oven so we could've cooked more! If you want a supermarket with a decent amount of choice it's worth taking a taxi to the Albufeira shopping centre where there is a good sized supermarket. The Intermarché (about 15 minutes walk) was OK but a bit pricey. We used a lot of taxis due to my mum's mobility difficulties and found them all pretty reasonable (especially as there were 4 of us). All the taxi drivers were very pleasant and helpful. I sometimes used Uber which were very competitive but called Real Transfers (I think they are linked to the hotel) when I couldn't get online. The pool and beach were both lovely. The heated pool was just about an acceptable temperature for maximum half an hour (February) before feeling chilly. The other pools are not heated. The beach is beautiful. Nice soft and clean sand and great views. Towels are provided for pool and beach use so no need to pack any! I wish I'd known that before bringing loads!It is rare that I return to the same holiday accommodation but I would definitely return to the Grande Real Santa Eulalia. Gorgeous holiday!"
Feb 2020,40,Beautiful location,"We stayed in an apartment close to the hotel. It was very spacious and had all the amenities we needed - 2 bedrooms, 2 bath, kitchenette. Shuttle into town a few times a day.Food was adequate, but found to be pricey compared to the quality and selection you can get in town. All staff were friendly and sincere - very helpful and relatively prompt service. I had 2 teen boys with me. It would have been nice for them to have a games room or sports equipment, but we were only there for a few days and they enjoyed exploring the beach. We also did the surf lessons through a private company organised by the hotel - and this was amazing. Totally worth it and more beautiful beaches. Trip exceeded my expectations!"
Feb 2020,50,"Paul from Stratford, Ontario",Excellent Hotel! Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Morning buffet and service was the best we experienced in Portugal. Room was large with a balcony overlooking the ocean. Very clean hotel. Free shuttle service to new and old town was added value. Will definitely return.
Feb 2020,50,Homely and pleasant accomodation,"I ´ll be back for sure!!! I chose the hotel because I am familar with Acoteias, Olhos de Auga and Albufeira. I appreciate a relaxed atmosphere instead of snobbistc behavour. The location is absolutely top."
Feb 2020,50,Perfect holiday,We come every year.My son love the Kids Club!I love the burgers. We like everything there. We will come back!!!!!!!!!Everything was perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thank you for your services!!!!!!!!!!!!!See you next year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Feb 2020,40,First visit to Portugal ,"Returned yesterday from this hotel in Portugal, on the whole it was a lovely holiday but there are a few things that we felt could be improved upon.  Whilst there I celebrated my birthday, on the afternoon I was very surprised by a knock at the door and a tray with a cake and a bottle of bubbly was delivered, from the management and staff, it was a lovely surprise and very much appreciated. The Pro’s - the hotel is lovely as are the staff, the situation of the hotel right on the beach is beautiful.  The shuttle bus to the new and old town are a definite plus.The meals generally were quite good, but it did seem that a large majority of the meals in the evenings were very heavily flavoured with garlic.  The breakfast was excellent and the choices vast.The cons - Whilst we were there there was a conference at the hotel for 3 nights, the guests of the hotel were not advised this was going to happen.  On the second two nights there was a burger/hot dog stall positioned next to the beach wall.  The noise from the conference attendees was horrendous, shouting and singing till 4.00am & 6.00am,  there was no consideration at all given to paying guests who were hoping for a restful & peaceful holiday.  We initially had to ask to move rooms as when sitting on the balcony the people on the next balcony appeared to be chain smokers and it was impossible to sit out and enjoy the view.  As non smokers this was a real problem for us, we had upgraded to a sea view room to be able to enjoy sitting out during the day and the evening. Reception staff were excellent and moved us very quickly.  This again became a problem on the last 4 nights of our stay as the people underneath our room were also smokers and this again impacted upon us being able to sit out. The smell was disgusting and wafted into our room, not a pleasant experience.Would it be an idea to have one side of the hotel allocated to smokers and the other side to non smokers then everybody could enjoy their little bit of space.The second week was much busier and there were a lot of children of all ages in the hotel, I know the hotel is not adult only but I wonder if it might be an idea and perhaps safer to have a separate time for families to use the dining room, the concern was that there were a lot of small children milling around when people were getting their meals and making their way back to their tables, the chances of accident was very real. A lovely hotel, the weather was amazing whilst we were there, Portugal as a destination and the people make it a great place to visit.  We have already booked for next year."
Feb 2020,50,Really good,"Have been to the beach bar here today,we are staying at the hotel and spa across the road.We had the vegetarian lasagne,steak sandwich and spaghetti bolognese. Service is rapid,food was really good and very reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend."
Feb 2020,50,Excellent hotel,"Just back form a long weekend stay and had brilliant time. Hotel grounds very impressive and well kept and with private beach access. The room was huge, clean with lovely sea view. Breakfast in restaurant was plenty, loved the fresh fruits and there was even prosecco :). Free shuttle to old town in Albufeira few time daily and loads of bars/restaurants 10 min walk away. The staff all around the hotel was very kind and attentive, always smiling. I did not like the idea of having to pay for each teabag or coffee sachet I use in the room, even for the sugar ( that would be the only negative point I have), so I just got my own supplies from nearby shop and there was a fridge in the room to store the milk. Overall great relaxing stay and would love to come back."
Feb 2020,50,Excellent,"Excellent service, beautiful location, delicious food , friendlig personal.Design of the hotel is very attractive and stylish, beach is perfect. Breakfast included a lot of fresh fruits .I had a lively week to stay."
Feb 2020,40,Great Location and Service,"We enjoyed three nights at this resort. Weather in February was excellent with sunshine everyday. Spouse loved our stay so much she wants to spend full month next year. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment with kitchen, and a patio and it was very suitable to our needs. As it was the off season, the whole complex was very quiet. Food in the main restaurant was very good and staff attentive. Couple of things to note: the kitchen has all appliances but has no provisions (even coffee and sugar) and there is no dish soap for washing up. Beds are very hard as others have noted. Lastly, management should design and print a map of their property detailing all restaurants, bars, etc and easy access to the beautiful beach. Would definitely stay here again inspite of minor issues noted."
Feb 2020,50,Very nice resort in a quiet surrounding,"Like this resort because of the friendly staff, it was very clean and quiet. And the most important; the location and the view. The food was delicious and especially the breakfast was excellent and a large variety !!!!!!!"
Jan 2020,50,Grande Is a Real good Hotel,"My Wife,Granddaughter,and myself  enjoyed our weeks Stay at this Hotel.From arrival at reception,suitcases taken to room,warm and friendly welcome from staff.then getting our room witch was as described, with a beautiful sea view.We all enjoyed our meals at both restaurants(and burger bar at the beach) and the staff were always warm and welcoming,especially the head of restaurant who said I looked Like Santa(I do) had a laugh.The free shuttle bus mon.to fri. was very welcome,to visit new and old towns.The outdoor swimming pools were great,but very cold (I am Scottish so did not bother me)but once in was great.I had 2 sessions in the Turkish bath,at only 5 euros per session was fantastic value for money,and highly recommend it.So to sum up,I give this hotel 5 star rating,and thank them for a perfect week."
Jan 2020,50,Lovely resort,Beautiful hotel with very big space .has a good view towards the sea ..with lovely beach side ..excellent for walk during sunset. Been here with my two friends enjoyed alot .the high street is 10 minutes walk .good places around to explore..............................................
Jan 2020,50,We couldn't fault anything,"My partner and I stayed for a week, and were swept away by the hotel itself and how friendly and helpful the staff were. We can't wait to go back. It was one of the best holidays we've ever had. Everything was amazing."
Jan 2020,10,Beware shady practices,"Do not book here, they overbook the rooms and cancel on you! Having booked and deposited for a room over two months ago we received a message saying our room was to be cancelled and we were no longer welcome to stay. Be very wary of booking here as there is a good chance you will never make it to your room!"
Jan 2020,50,Great resort - will come back with pleasure.,"Great hotel resort - well-situated directly on the beach, comfortable, quite modern building, friendly staff. Free parking. Each room has a balcony and a kettle. English TV channels. Would love to come back in summer to use outdoor swimming pools, beach, and a variety of restaurant/bars/disco. The only minor improvements I suggest are free tea/coffee in the room, some renovation of the furniture and a little special touch at breakfast."
Jan 2020,50,The best for January,We enjoyed our sea view room a lot. Even during this time of the year the climate is real nice. Location of the hotel is perfect. Staf is very kind & helpfull. Breakfast with the variety of fresh fruits is outstanding. Price/Performance (January 2020) almost impossible. They will see us again!
Jan 2020,50,Birthday get away ,What like to say a big thank you to all staff at grande real Santa eulalia for our amazing stay with them was there with my wife for our birthdays my 40th my wife ordered room service and I received a birthday cake and bottle of prosecco complementary the room was large and the sea view totally amazing rooms cleaned every day very friendly staff would do anything for you even for January the weather was great for the time of year old town well worth the visit very beautiful not much open but still shop and bars open for things to do just a beautiful place to visit with be back again thank grande real santa eulalia
Jan 2020,50,Great beach,We stayed here last year with 2 friends had a great time nice staff very helpful room very nice cleaned every day three pools we were self catering so did not use the restaurant but have booked again for June and we are going bed and breakfast looking forwood to getting back beach is fantastic
Jan 2020,50,Fabulous 5 Star,"This hotel is everything a 5 star hotel stands for. From the moment both my boyfriend and I stepped inside the hotel to the moment we departed, we were treated with top of the range 5 star service. We requested a sea view, quiet room and a kettle - all to which we received. The room was so spacious. The attention to detail from the hotel was admirable. The private beach is a gem, we spent quite some time here, very peaceful! There is 3 pools, one was heated so we could spend time in it. The majority of the people in the hotel spoke English or at least tried to which really helps! There was a large selection for breakfast which we really enjoyed each morning. Our room was cleaned very well each day. There’s a shuttle bus to new and old town for free which was very handy! (only during weekdays however) We did have to use taxis a little bit, however the taxi service “real transfers” which we used each time was 5 star service also!! The taxi driver we had was so friendly and gave us lots of information on the areas we went to! Nothing was ever an issue. We preferred vidamoura a lot more than old and new town it’s a 20 minute taxi but well worth it. A lot was open and it has a greater selection of restaurants. Highly recommend the restaurant san martino (Italian) 5 min drive from hotel - it was delish!    We would absolutely return to this hotel as it ticked all boxes for a fun relaxing holiday with zero stress."
Jan 2020,40,Beautiful location,"Lovely hotel in nice area on the beach  weather was warm and sunny for January very cold in the evening.hotel set in lovely gardens ,staff were fantastic very friendly and helpful ,breakfast was excellent good choice and room kept well .had a room with sea view great balcony view was lovely but rooms were clean but dated pillows definitely need changing  but a very spacious room had a lovely week and a perfect week in sunshine would recommend the hotel in a quieter area of Albufeira"
Jan 2020,50,Superb Hotel,"Stayed here last year as a family with young children and cannot recommend the hotel highly enough. The staff are wonderful to deal with, nothing was too much trouble. I had a requested a self catering house in a certain area, and got exactly what I request. The hotel breakfast is the best I have ever had while travelling, the restaurant staff especially were wonderful. I am looking forward to returning again this year, for a longer stay."
Jan 2020,40,Très bien situé!,"The close proximity to the beautiful beach and general layout of hotel and facilities. The location on the beach is outstanding. Very friendly staff, spacious room with spacious beds. We went there in January so it as really calm ! The only minus was the bed, old mattresses.... The rooms are a little old fashioned and could need an update but overall it is more than ok. Thank you !"
Jan 2020,50,A True 5 star!,"A True 5 star! All of the best, facilities but most of all very nice and efficient staff. I surely recommend. I didn't took breakfast at the hotel once I find it somehow expensive for a continental breakfast."
Jan 2020,50,Visit To The Algarve,The hotel was situated in an excellent position for convenience to local entertainment and beach facilities. The staff were always available and all enquiries were dealt with speedily and in a friendly manner. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family. The only reservation I have about the room was the lighting which was a bit low when you were reading.
Jan 2020,50,Great Break,"We had a fantastic week stay here in a self-catering apartment in Dec-Jan. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the facilities were excellent. Located next to a great beach, and in easy range of Albufeira, but secluded and peaceful as well."
Jan 2020,50,I love Portugal and the Grande Real Santa Eulalia,"2nd time to stay, last minute trip.  New years eve in old town amazing fireworks.  We stayed in the self catering apartments. The receptions staff and porters so helpful, the ladies who cleaned the room every, all the staff are so nice and genuinely helpful and patient.  It is a dream to work on the beach in sunshine on the 1st of January, 2020.  Such a wonderful hotel.  Its heaven.  Thank you."
Jan 2020,50,Excellent Stay,"Excellent location, close to beach and so relaxing. Staff were excellent everywhere, from the reception , the cleaners, bar and restaurant to the beauty and spa. A great place to chill out. Escellent bus service to the new or old town."
Jan 2020,50,Great Xmas getaway,"Good value for money for a great Xmas getaway in beautiful Albufeira. The apartment was very clean with all the facilities you could ask for, the restaurants very nice and with a good variety of food, and the kids club very recreational for the kids. But for me, the star of the resort was the Thalassotherapy Spa!!!"
Jan 2020,30,Needs a complete refurbishment,"Not a 5 star hotel.  The lobby is quite impressive but as soon as you walk down the hallway to the elevator, you start to see the problems.  The paint effect on the walls resembles mildew.  The carpeting in the hallways is dirty, not to mention ugly.  The lines on it would make you dizzy.  The rooms are clean and spacious, but so out-of-date and worn out.  There was a rather large area of damp on the bedroom wall (Room 217).  We believe this is from a possible leak from the bathroom shower/bath.  The sea view from our room was spectacular, but was slightly ruined by the dilapidated tennis court which needs total refurbishment - the astro turf is worn and faded and the paint is peeling off the boundary walls. The tea making facilities were a bit of a joke.  You have to boil the kettle on the floor which is a safety issue.  Then, the hotel does not explain that the first batch of tea, coffee, sugar, and bottled water are complimentary, yet you have to pay for each individual tea bag, etc. thereafter and you don't supply milk.  The dinner (we stayed half board) was A la Carte on one night and buffet the rest of our stay.  We were told A la Carte Monday - Thursday with buffet Friday to Sunday, but this didn't happen (we stayed Thursday night to Thursday afternoon).  The food the first 2 nights was delicious and fresh and we were really impressed but it started to decline the following nights.  The hotel information booklet states that the water is safe to drink yet you did not supply a pitcher of water on any of the dining tables and charged us nearly 4 euros for 1 bottled water.  Room cleaning was varied - cleaners sometimes forgetful but I'm sure they have a large amount of rooms to go through.  All staff very friendly and helpful but at the end of our dinners, we were met with slightly aggressive staff at the computer when it came to paying for our water.  The Atlântico and it's staff were great!! There is one thing I want to strongly complain about....the bird show....unacceptable.... the birds were brought in to the hotel lobby late at night to 'entertain' the hotel guests.  They should be in their natural habitat and not in a hotel!!  We went to our room, rather than watch but were told the following morning that one of the birds got frightened and flew straight into the glass door!!!"
Jan 2020,40,Christmas in Portugal,"We stayed last year and enjoyed the Christmas Gala though it was chaotic, this year was more organised but not as good! Food average too much fish for me, even fish soup !! Entertaining last year very good, this year poorRoom cleaning varied, but mainly poor, pillows constantly mixed up and often left on top of my sun hat which was on the case!! Night dresses thrown into the chair ( not by me) and left thereOverall a very nice hotel but room to improve"
Jan 2020,30,Not for me,Lovely hotel but in the middle of nowhere . Reception staff amazing . Lights in reception always too bright for entertainment . No little shop so forced to pay ridiculous price for a coke . Not decorated enough for Christmas
Jan 2020,20,Not a 5 star experience,"Beach was lovely and structure of building good. Food excellent however things that go to make a 5 star experience were missing in there place were chipped and unstable dining chairs, worn and stained seating in bar area, workman style tea mugs in bedroom, non functioning air conditioning, spa out of commission, charging for tea, coffee, milk etc in room (1.5 Euro each tea bag), the use of a voucher system for meals (very humiliating experience) a very large complex no map or instruction given for guidance around site the first evening in the dining room we had to sit with outdoor jackets on as it was so cold. Initial request to speak to a manager brought no response."
Jan 2020,40,Lovely stay,"Lovely hotel, we used as bed and breakfast to explore the Algarve. Our first visit to Algarve.  Hotel fine and breakfast was all anyone could ask for.A small comment is that the bed, we found to be too hard to be comfortable."
Dec 2019,40,Room was clean and comfortable.,The dinner buffet was not a good value for 29 euros. The meat dishes of veal and pork were of poor quality and lacked flavor. I would recommend eating in town for a better food value. The hotel was situated in a beautiful area and the service stall could not have been more helpful. I don’t know why the hotel would put out such a poor quality of a buffet when everything else was of high quality.
Dec 2019,50,"Very good Stay, Probaly the best service ever","Best service I have ever had, excellent facilities, very good spa, a little pricey but you expect that from a 5 star, rooms where cleaned everyday and maids where brilliant even waiting when we wanted a laying would defiantly recommend for children as kids clubs where amazing. Literally the only thing wrong was TV channels and Bed Firmness but out of everything would rate the hotel out of this world"
Dec 2019,50,Great Hotel and great service,"Stayed with family for seven nights. We had a great time there. Kids(9 and 5 years old) really loved the kids club. Food was superb, customer service excellent.They try to provide best in class personalized service. My wife's b'day was during our stay, she was provided with complimentary champagne and cake delivered to our apartment. We had bit to trouble with water heating, we were offered options to choose from: stay in same apartment and get it fixed, move to different room(with upgrade to pool side apartment). In addition we were again given champagne for inconvenience. That gave the impression of the hotel trying to provide best in class service and experience."
Dec 2019,50,Fantastic!!!!,"Stayed here in may 2019 with my mum, the food , the room, the cleaness everything 5 stars!!! staff very friendly and helpful. theres a free bus that takes you into old town and new town and theres designated pick up places. 100% recommend. i am already looking at my next trip away!!"
Dec 2019,50,Great place,Very good experience Love to stay at Hrande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa. Very nice location and it was very good weather. Very good facilities at the resort. Friendly staff members. Very helpful
Dec 2019,50,xmas hols,"I thoroughly enjoyed our xmas stay with yourselves from start to finish.  I cant fault any of it.  We were extremely impressed with the xmas eve banquet, it was out of this world and so unexpected. The staff are so friendly and helpful and I strongly recommend anyone to go to this hotel.  also, the bus into the old and new town is an added bonus."
Dec 2019,40,Very pleasant stay,"The staff couldn’t be more helpful, all lovely. We went at a very quiet time of year so there wasn’t much to do in the hotel but the room was great, very clean. They have free shuttle buses from the hotel to the old and new town. We had an event on at the hotel while we were there so the shuttle buses couldn’t get in, but they had staff taking us to the bus stop at the top of the road on golf buggies which we found was brilliant, couldn’t be more helpful. Pools were clean. Private beach access, the beach is beautiful too. The food wasn’t amazing but there was enough to eat. We only went bed and breakfast and the breakfast wasn’t fantastic. Room was cleaned every day but I don’t think the sheets were changed very often. Chocolate was put on your pillow everyday. When we arrived, there was slippers and gowns for us which was great. Everybody was friendly, the burger restaurant in the hotel is absolutely lovely. The burgers are to die for! Overall nice place to stay, would highly recommend but it’s not really for kids as there isn’t much to do. Would recommend it for friends and couples."
Dec 2019,20,Very bad fourth experience,"very angry about this 4th experience: bad checkin, my suite was noisy and in bad conditions (parquet to be renewed, bathroom in bad condition, ...)Diner was bad: bad quality of salads (I asked a salad with asparagus and only a little asparagus was offered); Thalassotherapy not functionning, fitness with old machines)Too many ""fiestas"" in the night until 4pm!!!etc.etc"
Dec 2019,50,Wonderful ,This was our third winter break  stay at the Grand Real and it was wonderful. The location beside the beach is fantastic and the facilities are superb.On arrival the guys on reception were so helpful and welcoming changing our room when we asked. Breakfasts are superb and the rooms spotless.Wonderful break.
Dec 2019,40,"Good hotel, great kids club. Winter menu needs more option","We arrived as a family during the winter months. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel if you can get it at a good price. Here are the pros:Great kids club staff. Although only the small wood hut is open in winter they did make the stay enjoyable for our kids. Frequent cleaningGood reception very helpfulAmazing beach which is very close to hotelMain consWe are vegetarian and went full board. Options were too limited. We could only choose from a cheese baguette, gnocchi and pizza. For the kids it was pretty much pizza and chips. Would advise you go in summer when buffet is open for more variety. Cannot use the vouchers anywhere but main restaurant. They will not provide tap water so you are forced to buy drinks. Strange as this was fine at breakfast.  Because of this we cannot give the full 5 starsRooms were clean but there were alot of ants.We are a family of 4. The sofa bed is very hard and uncomfortable.No access to indoor pool for kids in winter. Outdoor heated pool is too cold so we didn't use pool at all.Overall as I said for the low price we feel it was good however would question it not being a 5 star hotel and it being more like a 4  star at a pushfor reasons mentioned above.We would not stay in the winter time again here and will explore something in the canaries but perhaps summer we would look back here if the deal was right."
Dec 2019,40,December break,Resort and staff are amazing and can not fault this hotel.I wouldn’t go back to Albufeira in December again though as most things were closed and my Children were bored and there was nothing to do weather also a factor in that. Kids club could of been better and for a broader audience
Dec 2019,40,"Great Hotel, Great Beach",Great location and views of the beach and ocean.  The room was very comfortable and general facilities were very good.  Staff on reception very helpful and informative on what would be good day trips.  Overall a great hotel!.
Dec 2019,50,Awesome!,Must visit . Awesome location. Nice service. Nice and spacious rooms depending on your choices made.Best for solo and family trips. Good sea food and Burgers. Breakfast and dinner are with variety and quality
Dec 2019,50,Fabulous stay I would highly recommend,Our stay from start to finish was amazing I couldn’t fault the hotel the staff were so helpful. We booked the anniversary dinner to celebrate me parters 30th birthday while we were there I would highly recommend anyone that’s staying at the hotel that have a celebration Occurring to book this the staff went beyond themselves to make sure the night was one to remember. We are already looking into booking a return holiday in the summer
Dec 2019,50,Lovely,Lovely location hotel We went as a couple with friends and we loved it Would be even better if we went in season which is why we will be going back 😂 recommend this hotel and the beach is nice tooSpacious room we had a studio The only problem I had was they didn’t put a complementary coffee in our room I would have appreciated that although there is a kettle and everything you need in your room I wish I would have taken my own coffee to make a cuppa like I usually would lol but Apart from this everything is ok 👌
Dec 2019,50,Amazing,The staff went above and beyond for my husbands birthday with no request or prompt.Very clean and comfortable Beautiful location and a stones throw from the beach.We will come back again with the kids. Thank you so much
Dec 2019,50,Great Hotel,The hotel made every effort to make sure we was comfortable.Hotel is a way out from the main town of Albufeira but a taxi costs around €6-7 and the hotel also runs free shuttle buses.Very quiet and relaxing holiday!
Dec 2019,50,Short stay,"Excellent hotel set in a beautiful location there service was excellent there food was very good  . A good variety, and there staff where very helpful will be back again In the near future brian murphy @ Rosemarie"
Dec 2019,40,Winter break Algarve,Very good choice  for a winter break. Great location with easy access to Albufeira and the rest if Algarve. Big free car park in front if the hotel is an added bonus. Sales staff very helpful to arrange a room upgrade.
Dec 2019,50,Wonderful Hotel,"The hotel is perfect for a quiet getaway with stunning views, great service and winter sunshine.  The sunsets are spectacular and the staff are excellent.  We have stayed here a few times now and always leave wanting to stay longer."
Dec 2019,40,Rooms,"The rooms are old, the furniture and  chairs are stained and they require work, the bathroom is outdated. The balcony is falling apart with chunks of plaster about to fall on the floor. The spa is over priced."
Dec 2019,50,Great hotel & Location (RUDE STAFF AT BREAKFAST),"Beautiful hotel, parking available directly outside, extremely polite and professional front house staff, spacious room with a sea view. Beach is a 3 minute walk away. Breakfast staff extremely rude cleared plates from all tables around except ours (deliberately avoid us) turning up their noses and make us feel very unwelcome.Dinner service was much more professional, food was exceptional. Lots to do local would recommend hiring a car."
Dec 2019,50,Fabulous Location,"Booked the holiday through Loveholidays! Have to say our expectations weren’t what we expected the hotel was fabulous in a beautiful location! Waking up and seeing the sea view was fab! All the staff were very helpful, couldn’t do enough for you! Would highly recommend! Thank you for a lovely stay at your fabulous hotel!"
Dec 2019,40,Short Break,Hotel is located in a very good location rooms are available with sea view.and has lot of facility but this time of the year they are limited and good breakfast and the dinner only limited choices as buffet service was not available.  I dont mind visit again with family on summer time to see the most.
Dec 2019,50,Great stay,Great stay and perfekt Location... Breakfast overwhelming and very nice staff. Good Pizzeria just outside the Resort If the Restaurants are good expensive. Recommendation for Business and Families Aline.
Dec 2019,50,Perfect Hotel,"The hotel was gorgeous, the staff where friendly, cleaner cleaned every single day. Beach right on your door step. I would take marks off for this issue but I just want to let other people know if you are staying in the grand real it’s a little bit more expensive to eat in the hotel restaurant and burger place but the food is worth the price. It was one of the best places I have ever stayed to be honest. Beautiful and Quiet. I recommend to everyone to stay."
Dec 2019,50,Very nice resort with beautiful beach,"Beautiful resort for couples or families. Friendly personal, delicious breakfast, beautiful beach,bus service to town centre,every day clean rooms, nespresso coffee machine in each room, activities for children"
Dec 2019,40,Return visit to Portugal,"Usually stay in hotels but thought we would give a studio apartment a try, this was not the success we hoped for. Felt like we were away from it all. Having our own holiday home in the UK, West Wales, which is very well equipped, we found the studio apartment at the Grand Real lacking in this regard.The apartment cleaning staff were lovely and friendly and did their best. But due to the air conditioning and overall apartment environnement my partner and myself developed bad chests, in fact my partner had to see a Doctor who prescribed antibiotics. Whether staying in the hotel would have been better, remains to be seen."
Nov 2019,40,Algarve resort,"Nice beach, apartment not kitchenette not well equipped,patio had NO shade- not covered and no umbrella and no privacy. No soundproofing, so difficult to sleep when noisy. Kids were up until midnight.Free bus service to 2 town locations was efficient and necessary and appreciated.Lots of room in apartments, but furniture was worn and tattered."
Nov 2019,50,Great stay,"Lovely hotel with great amenities. Very friendly staff who can't do enough for you. My stay was full board and the food in the main restaurant was excellent, particularly breakfast and the a la carte menu at lunch."
Nov 2019,50,Superb,Most enjoyable trip highly recommend paul claffey tours and  hotel 🏨   Loved every minute & staff so friendly and helpful no matter what hour you needed assistance.  Highly recommend and can’t wait to return in 2020
Nov 2019,50,Fantastic,"We were away for a short break with our 1 year old, who fell ill whilst we were there. I really can't fault any of the staff enough, they helped to keep our son happy and called a doctor for him when requested. We really can't thank them enough."
Nov 2019,50,Excellent break,"We couldn't have asked more from the staff they were helpful and courteous at all times, nothing appeared to be too much trouble.Our apartment was clean tidy and of a very good standard.We took advantage of the spa having a treatment and time  in the thalasotherapy pool which was amazing.The only disappointment was when we booked it did say indoor pool which we had intended to use daily, the only indoor pool was in the Spa and not for general swimming.The only other negative was the lack of choice for vegetarians, however the certainly would not deter me from returning for another break."
Nov 2019,50,Amazing,"I loved every part of the hotel, definitely worth staying in the summer time or any time of the year, absolutely amazing. A must when in Albufeira. Go Books  now .. you’ll won’t regret any of it at all."
Nov 2019,50,resort stay,"Extremely good rating for this accommodation, location and services offered, facilities excellent and helpful staff.  The bar, lounge, pool areas, dining rooms and reception are very bright and decor is pleasing all round."
Nov 2019,50,Hotel stay,When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the staff who took our suit cases to our room while we checked in. The staff where really helpful and friendly. The view from the hotel to the sea was really good and the walk to the beach was nothing. You have bus in to albufeira like every hour for free which was really good.
Nov 2019,50,Would highly recommend,"Enjoyed every bit of our stay, planning to return to this hotel with the kids next time. Everywhere was accessible and local. Service was great, resort and hotel room were lovely. Facilities were great, all in one hotel couldn’t ask for anything better"
Nov 2019,40,Beautiful beach,"The staff are amazing, the a la carté meal in the restaurant was excellent and the amenities are plenty. The hotel is on a fabulous beach and it’s gorgeous to walk along and relax. The pool area is okay although we didn’t venture into the water.The bus to the town is handy.We didn’t realise how close the hotel was to the town when W walking until closer to the end of our holiday. It seems longer on the bus but in fact when you turn left and walk for 5 minutes, your in the heart of the bars and restaurants.The bedrooms are in need of a little updating and a few small things would really make a huge difference such as more and better quality shampoos, conditioners, etc. Any other 5 star hotel we have stayed in would have toothbrushes and cleansers, and maybe a razor or other nice little extras but here it was shampooing conditioner and shower/bath gel and body lotion. A coffee machine would make a nice modern addition too. But lucky our room had the most amazing balcony with a view that we could watch all day and night! So really the room being a little outdated didn’t make any difference. Unfortunately we had to cut our holiday short due to a family emergency back home and the staff at the hotel, helped us to arrange taxis and printed train time tables and were very supportive at a very difficult time so many thanks must go to the staff, thank you and well done."
Nov 2019,40,Nice hotel but need a bit upgrade,Me and my friend went there for a long weekend staff of lovely they upgraded our room to 1 bedroom apartment . When we got in the apartment was a ground floor lovely little apartment with kitchenette so the bad hub but no pots and shower had curtain still what I find very old and unhygienic also not many option for vegans.spa was ok but didn’t feel like a relaxing spa more felt like swimming pool gym area  for a 5* hotel was expecting bit more but overall was nice
Nov 2019,50,Fantastic hotel thoroughly recommended,"Excellent customer experience, this is our 2nd visit!! , large, clean accommodation, really lovely staff and the evening entertainment was brilliant, beautiful setting with private beach we highly recommend this hotel to couples families and buisiness travellers for a relaxed personalised stay."
Nov 2019,50,Lovely hotel in a great secluded location,"If you are looking for a luxurious quiet retreat with a really nice Spa then this hotel is a great choice.Very clean, lovely beach right in front of the hotel. Rooms are well appointed and clean. Food is of good quality and variety."
Nov 2019,30,Not 5 star very disappointed,"Returned yesterday from our 5 night break this was a last minute booking due to unforseen circumstances. 1 leaky kettle, 2,wrong info on instructions when using the safe which made it difficult. 3, Maid does not refill tea/coffee when asked for extra coffee and milk was told it will be 15 euros or go to the bar as it may be cheaper? Buffet hot food lukewarm. Lunch when ordered is very good as is cooked fresh. Staff friendly and helpful although you have to ask for excursions as not told there are any,? Nice hotel we have stayed in better 3 star across the world."
Nov 2019,40,My Review,"I think only a few  things were lacking in the room  - the poor quality of the toilet paper, the facf that coffee, sugar, milk etc had to be purchased and there was not an irob/ironing board available in the room."
Nov 2019,50,holday,enjoyed our stay location was perfect  room was big clean  and comfortable. staff were polite and helpful. breakfast could of been better if the food was hotter and there was English sausages. bus service  to old town was great. beach was clean at all times. hotel was nice and quiet at night time
Nov 2019,40,NIce resort,"We stayed at the end of the season (November 2019). We were lucky with the weather...sunny and warm each day. The resort at this time of year was quite and calm (just what we needed). The heated pool was ideal for the afternoon or when is was a little cloudy. There was enough to keep us (two adults and kids 12 & 9) entertained between the excellent meals. We were full board and all came away having gained a couple of kilos! The array of options for breakfast was excellent. Lunch quality was good but the same options each day became a little boring. This was made up for in the evening when each day a different and wide variety of good quality options was available. Breakfast and supper were buffets so quantity was up to you. The sports facilities could do with an upgrade but were functional. The beach is public but has private access from the hotel. It is a lovely sandy, picturesque beach and was quite while we were there. The rooms were nice and a good setup for a family like ours. Our two kids shared the lounge which was well equipped with two sofa beds. There was also a nice kitchen area if you wanted to self cater. The bedroom for the grown ups was a good size and comfortably set up. I word of caution. When we visited a few years ago, our son, then aged 5 was able to open the patio door in the lounge and make a bid for escape. We had to put the kids in the bedroom while we slept on the sofa bed in the lounge.Overall a lovely resort with nice friendly staff that is well setup and appointed. I'd go back."
Nov 2019,40,Great Place,"Lovely staff and location, great amenities available, only negative we encountered was that our room smelt of cigarette smoke and decor looked tired (marks along the wall, desks heavily scratched, mirror scratched up etc.), apart from that, had great time, breakfast was fantastic with a good variety, the beach bar is a top place to hang out, would come again but maybe get a different room"
Nov 2019,40,Not any more a 5 stars,"Built 15 years ago, the hotel  shows now its age., mainly  the rooms.There was mold around the bath, the water flow is low; old type faucet should be replaced; refreshing would be a good move. Otherwise everything was OK.Nice and vast lobby; very good breakfast  as well as the  evening buffet; good service from the personal. Beautiful beach well maintained."
Nov 2019,50,Great stay,Surpassed expectations.  Stunning setting. Stayed with wife and 2 year old. Stayed in two bed apartment. Was huge. Got upgraded on arrival from a one bed. Delighted. Staff friendly.  Couldn't say a bad word
Nov 2019,50,Amazing holiday 😎,"Me an partner came here on the 5th of November until the 12th we came home yesterday 😢. This hotel is beautiful in every way. It’s located on a stunning beach where you have such amazing views from the hotel an the pool area. The staff cannot do enough for you and cater for your every possible needs. The weather even for this time of the year was really nice some days up to 26 degrees. There’s not a lot outside the hotel so if your looking for a quiet relaxing holiday it’s perfect, although there is a free bus into new town and old town from outside the hotel lobby where you have a lot of bars an restaurants. Overall this holiday was amazing an I’m already looking to book again for next summer but for 2 weeks instead of 1. Thankyou to all the hotel staff who made our stay that extra special."
Nov 2019,50,Irene McCabe,"Stayed in Grande Real Santa Eulalia recently,from the moment we arrived we were looked after so well staff could not have been more helpful nothing was too much trouble have to mention Irena she was brilliant, beautiful Hotel breakfast was amazing view from room 327 spectacular! would definitely recommend this Hotel and would certainly stay there again."
Nov 2019,30,3 night break,"The hotel must only have 5 stars due to the private beach, after paying nearly £900 for a 3 night stay for 1 adult and 2 children I expected more. The rooms were rundown, I expected a proper bed and not a lumpy pull out sofa. He 2 bathrooms were clean but running green water in one and brown water in the other. There were chunks of plaster missing out of the walls and the tv only worked in Spanish. The food was appalling and most of the bars and resteraunts were closed and no evening entertainment so had to walk into town on an evening"
Nov 2019,50,Great Stay,"Excellent stay in late Oct/early Nov - the staff were incredible and went so far beyond normal duty to help out guests at all times (desk/breakfast/room-cleaners, everyone involved). Breakfast was excellent and there is a frequent bus service to both the new and the old town. Night time music was also excellent. The beach at the hotel is exceptionally clean. Although a little bit outside of the town I would highly recommend (Taxi to new town approx €4 - old town approx €6). Plenty of privacy and all food/bar options were terrific."
Nov 2019,50,Just Fabulous ! ,We visited the Grande Real Santa Eulália resort for a week in October as a family holiday. There were 2 x Adults and 2 x boys (7) & (4) in total. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we had the most fantastic experience. Every member of staff we met could not have been more helpful and the resort facilities are fantastic from the numerous pools scattered around the complex to the ultimately brilliant location on the beach front. We had a one bedroom self catering apartment which was massive with an open garden outlook and it was cleaned each and every day by the maids to a very high standard. Albeit we did not use the Spa facilities we did use the gym on occasion which is free for guests and it has everything you would need for a decent workout. The star of the show for our family had to be the free kids club which our boys absolutely loved. There were different activities every day and the staff there were just absolutely brilliant with all the children. This facility really made our holiday and allowed my wife and I for the first time really since the boys arrived to spend some relaxing quality time together. I long for our afternoon stroll along the beach to the most fantastic little elevated beach bar where we would enjoy some light refreshments safe in the knowledge our boys were being looked after properly and importantly having fun. Our routine was to collect the boys from the club after that and then spend our time body boarding in the sea. Honestly it was simply fantastic. In addition the position of the hotel is such that if you do not wish to take the courtesy bus into the resort centre then more local (and more cost effective) alternative bars/restaurants were literally only a few minutes walk away. This was honestly one of the best and most relaxing (well as relaxing as you can get with a 7 and 4 year old in tow!) holiday we have had and I would return to the Grande Real Santa Eulália resort tomorrow if we could. We have recommended this resort to all our friends and I would highly recommend it to all reading this review. Well done to all the staff at this amazing resort. Top job 👍
Nov 2019,50,A Great Family Sports/Activity Holiday: October/November,An excellent hotel in a fabulous location. The staff are excellent and friendly. Breakfasts are great and I would book half board next time as alternative restaurants were not really available. Surprisingly it was quite difficult to get seafood as the seafood restaurants in the resort seem to close in September! It is not so easy to go off resort due to a busy road. Apart from this problem for us as seafood lovers we had a great time. We used the gym session which were excellent and highly recommended. We also used the tennis courts which I am afraid needed repair as they were very tired. One court (out of two) was unplayable because the net was set too low and this was not adjustable. The Bar Atlantico was in an excellent location with great friendly service but the menu was too international for our liking with no Portuguese seafood dishes which was a surprise. Overall a great place and highly recommended.
Nov 2019,40,Very good,Great location for the beech and to relax great shuttle bus service great choice of food for breakfast some areas could do with upgrading for a 5 star hotel. Staff very friendly and most helpful. Showers in bedroom could do wit an upgrade but overall nice place for relaxing holiday.
Nov 2019,50,Nice hotel on the beach,"Nice hotel by the sea, very friendly and helpful staff and wonderfully spacious rooms. We had a room with a sea view, beautiful.! Due to circumstances we had to leave a few days earlier. When checking out, the booking was made without any problems and we only paid for the nights we stayed. What a good service!"
Nov 2019,40,Wonderful location,The wine in the bar is far too expensive; the variety for lunch in pool bar is poor.Hotel location and rooms are very good. Value in this period is good. We advise to remove the outdated plastic curtain at the shower (move to glass).The survey is too long :(
Nov 2019,50,Family mini break,"Great hotel with professional friendly staff, very clean, nice pools and beach area to relax with family.  We enjoyed the beautiful beach bar overlooking the sea with food and drinks, we will definitely be back"
Nov 2019,50,Great family holiday over mid term,"We stayed in this hotel for a week during mid term.  Our 3 children aged 6, 7 and 9 absolutely love it as did we.  We went half board - breakfast was lovely with a great selection & although dining room for dinner was very quiet, we felt there was a great selection of food.  The hotel is in a stunning setting overlooking a beautiful beach.  The staff at the kids club were so kind to my children.  We will be returning :-)"
Nov 2019,50,Lovely relaxing holiday,"Really lovely hotel. We stayed in an apartment, which was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. The private beach is glorious, and the kids loved the pools. Staff all very friendly and helpful, particularly the guy who handled the luggage and the room cleaners. Would not hesitate to recommend."
Nov 2019,40,Another nice visit,"Our third time here, and as good as ever.  We tried self catering this time for the first time, just for breakfasts as there's lots of choice locally to eat out.  The room was well equipped, the cups were a bit small for British tastes and we had to buy washing up liquid and sponges, otherwise it was well furnished.  The staff were courteous as ever, and we ate in the Burger and Buffet restaurants which were very good.  We'll no doubt be back again soon, although the prices seem to have increased a lot on the previous year. Breakfast is 20Eur too which seems a bit steep."
Nov 2019,50,just beautiful,"excellent hotel great facillities breakfast was fab, the beach is the highlight just beside the hote. The hotel is a little quiet so you do have to go out at night but thats the not a problem with lots of places to go close by. the staff were lovely and could not have been friendlier, the hotel is clean and well managed I would definitely return.  It was my birthday during the trip and they sent a cake and bubbles to the room which was a lovely touch"
Nov 2019,50,Fantastic hotel,"Just back from a self catering holiday here at this fabulous hotel,staff were really lovely from the moment we checked in to checking out,food was fab,apartments were spotless and the views were amazing,the private beach is just a little slice of heaven and we will definitely be returning here as a family the next time."
Nov 2019,50,Best of the Best,"Best service and excellent food. The service staffs were very friendly and helpful. The only issue for me is the gym timing, I could prefer to do fitness eraly morning before my breakfast, but thats not an issue as I ran on the beach which was awesome too."
Nov 2019,50,Beyond Expectations!,"We stayed at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort hotel at the end of October. Everything about the hotel was excellent. We had a Seaview family room (recommended), which had 2 bathrooms, and 2 balconies. It was really quiet - no noise from other guests, and pool. The rooms were nicely cleaned every day to a very good standard. Fresh towels, and toiletries provided every day. The food in the restaurant was excellent. We stayed full board, and found the food quality and choice second to none. Really impressed with everything. The drinks we found were very pricey. Our son had his birthday during our stay, and we were blown away by the service - the hotel provided a complimentary cake, and the staff sang happy birthday to him! Couldn't have asked for more...it was just wonderful. Thank you so much for making this a memorable birthday for him. The free shuttle to town was fantastic, and very prompt, and the tour of Old Town done by the hotel staff very good. Kids even enjoyed it! The heated pool outside was perfect, and a really nice in November when the air temperature was a little cool. The gym, which we used every day was excellent. The equipment really good, good selection of free weights, nicely air conditioned with a water fountain and great music on the TV.But the best thing was the Kids Club. We visited during Halloween, and the staff dressed our kids up, face painted them and they all went trick or treating round the hotel. The staff were fantastic, and our kids asked every day to go to kids club. They absolutely loved the variety of activities. Thank you! We had an absolutely magical trip, that has given us beautiful memories of Portugal! The hotel, staff and everything about the hotel was perfect!"
Nov 2019,50,"Fabulous, relaxing family friendly hotel","The magnificent setting of this hotel was only bettered by the friendliness of the staff - I have never been in a hotel where the kids club was as well staffed with kind, interested staff who made the holiday a pleasure for parents and children alike! The options of trips out to a nearby adventure center (at a small cost) was a hit with both our younger and older children as was the fact that you could get diving lessons in the hotel pool (again at a small cost). Can't wait to go back here!"
Nov 2019,50,Autumn Break,"This was our fourth stay. Rooms comfortable and with everything you require. Very clean, comfortable beds. Rooms cleaned daily. We always go self-catering and cannot fault the equipment. Everything you need is there. Staff very accommodating and go out of their way to help from the moment you get there until you leave."
Nov 2019,40,Halloween Break,"This is our 2nd stay here and we enjoyed it very much. The hotel is situated on the beach and the weather was fantastic. There is a variety of restaurants and bars near by and a large supermarket about a mile away. My only complaints would be that our bed was very hard and would appear to be 2 single mattresses pushed together to create a double. Also on the second day the pool bar was closed and when we approached the staff who appeared to be cleaning and clearing out all the stock. We were told the bar was closed now for winter and we should go to the inside bar to get drinks. We did this on several occasions but it was quite a bit away from the pool and you had to climb 28 stairs and order you drinks and then come back down again.  My friend and I thought this most strange being a 5 star holiday and if the pool bar was closed surely they should have had waiter service! On our last day a waiter appeared out around the pool and took drink orders, which we did use.  I wonder did the hotel catch on that there was still a need for this service around the pool! Or had someone complained ??"
Nov 2019,40,Very good facility in an excellent location.,"Super friendly staff, excellent food choices, relaxing pool areas, clean facility. Lovely nearby beaches to explore and lots of dinner options in new and old town Albufeira. Just needs a few touch ups to make it a 5 star experience."
Nov 2019,50,Beautiful place,Just back from a relaxing stay at grand real santa eulalia. On arrival the staff were wonderful and helped us with our bags to our room. The room was spacious and immaculately kept. We had a stunning view of the beach. The breakfast was good lots of variety. We loved every minute of our stay. We would highly recommend and will definitely come back.
Oct 2019,40,Hotel to return to,Well worth a visit. I have stayed at this hotel 4 times with friends and family and all have loved it. Good for a relaxing break. It has a complimentary bus into Albufeira and also the service bus to Vilamoura stops right outside the hotel.
Oct 2019,20,Five Star? What decade?,"The tired looking wooden entrance sign told me all I needed to know. First impressions.Talking of firsts this is the only 5 star hotel that I've stayed in that didnt greet us with a welcome drink.The decor is tired,the pool side has a general ""don't care"" attitude. No sign of maintainance and no sign of a pool bar. Certainly no waiter service. Pool towels off colour and threadbare.The room is clean but ill designed in terms of sockets, As others have said kettle has to be plugged on the floor. The coffee/tea sugar offering hadn't been replenished . No attention to detail.The food offering is not as described. No Al a carte restaurant. Just a burger restaurant (pretty good) and a buffet - spectacularly bad! I've never eaten in a worse one in a hotel. The starter offering was made up of this mornings breakfast. This was not skillful recycling. Cold scrambled egg set in a pastry case with a slice of sausage. Really poor. No fresh fish or meat cooked to order so everything stewing under lights. The final straw? Stale cheese biscuits and no grapes to sweeten the sour taste of this experience.Having stayed many times at the nearby Porto Bay Falesia I recommend the manager here takes a look at how its done."
Oct 2019,20,Not recommended,"For a 5* hotel is totally disappointing.Rooms are old, no inside pool facilities for kids. All closest have a mold smell. Direct access to seaside compensate a little bit, but not to an 5* expectation."
Oct 2019,50,Fantastic place,"This is a very excellent hotel..We stayed in the self catering appartments, the rooms are very Portuguese in decoration, very clean and tidy and cleaners come in every day and do an excellent job. The staff in the main hotel and restaurants are very helpful and friendly and  cannot do enough for you. We hve enjoyed our stay here and at some point will return. I highly recommend this hotel."
Oct 2019,50,Lovely hotel,Good service and spotlessly clean. The food was very nice although the queues at breakfast were irritating as a little reorganisation of the position of the cooked food would have reduced the queues considerably.
Oct 2019,30,Poor vegetarian food choices during evening buffet,"The hotel generally is clean and tidy. Staff seem friendly and helpful. Vegetarian choice each evening in the buffet has been dreadful. It was tofu stew tonight, it was horrible, stewed vegetables last might equally as bad. It's a shame as meat eaters seem to have plenty of choice."
Oct 2019,50,Costa del folk,"Came for Costa del Folk music festival. Hotel was very good. Music (which was why we came) was excellent. Decent buffet breakfast and supper. Bed was comfy, room was clean. We will definitely come again."
Oct 2019,50,Excellent,Looking forward to 3rd stay in 2020.Found the sea view suite (247) just what we required.  Mattress in couch bed could be more comfortable. Maybe a second mattress or a  duvet over mattress would improve.
Oct 2019,40,Lovely holiday,My husband and I had a lovely time at the hotel. The bathrooms could be updated (new tiles as many broken) but the service is excellent and friendly and the hotel has everything! Staff are lovely. The mini bus is very handy.
Oct 2019,20,Poor customer service. No drinking Water in the room. Rip off!!!,"Am at the hotel right  since 3 days. Booked full board. (breakfast, lunch, dinner)Buffer breakfast and dinner only DRINKING WATER IS NOT INCLUDED. 4 EUROS FOR A SMALL BOTTLE!!!They don't even allow to carry your own water. Lunch menu at the real cozhina  limited, always empty. This was the only one we could eat in the full board.But the meal we had was very delicious but again had to buy expensive drinks and water.Coming to dinner. Never I had such TERRIBLE MENU.Me my wife had to rely on just fruits and desserts which were good. Again had to buy water.Not much for the kids. We only stayed in the beach.Beach is superb.tje famous golden sand. October and had sun burns. Again No sun beds given. Another company had sunbeds which you only had to hire. 15 euros per day per person. Such a rip off money extraction.These guys are only there for money but  don't think of customer care. DRINKING WATER AT LEASTI am giving 2stars only 1. Powerul wifi2.superb beach and lunch menu. Beware customers!!!"
Oct 2019,50,Another great visit,"Had a lovely time again at this hotel. Friendly staff as always, and clean and spacious apartment for a few days. Love the beach snack bar just to sit and watch the world go by.  Staff and food great.   Will be back."
Oct 2019,40,Lovely break,So lovely to be in the sunshine in October! Beautiful hotel with beach access. Service from staff excellent.  Everywhere clean.Courtesy coach into town. Breakfast excellent.  Other restaurants expensive and not the best quality.  Drinks expensive too. Could do with a happy hour!
Oct 2019,30,Food :(,"The evening meals were never hot! It's not hard to achieve so why is this hotel failing? I've stayed with a large group three times and there's been no improvement in this area at all. I heard numerous complaints regarding food temperature, some people said they won't stay here again."
Oct 2019,50,Costa del Folk Festival 3rd visit - see you again next year,"Fantastic Hotel, super design and layout, great food, and wonderful helpful staff.  We had a Garden View Room this year, it was comfortable, clean, and the daily service was impeccable.  Giant and really comfortable double bed, and we could even sea the sea.  Amazing breakfast buffet and a good evening dinner buffet although the main dishes were not very hot.  As a vegetarian I had no trouble finding enough to eat without having to ask for any special treatment. I very much appreciated the vegetarian dish added to the buffet this year. Sometimes I pinched the vegetables from the meat dishes as well ! The choice of fresh fruit at Breakfast and Dinner was excellent.  Good choice of desserts.  There were queues for the restaurant at peak times but it's difficult to cope with 700+ people all wanting eat at the same time in the break between the various activities and the evening concert.  We didn't mind sharing a table as we met some interesting people this way.  The young staff manning the pool bars spoke excellent English and were very extremely friendly and efficient.  A real credit to the Hotel and the image it gave of the Portuguese people.  We are already booked for Costa del Folk again next year."
Oct 2019,50,Costa del Folk,"Great festival in this lovely hotel. Plenty of space for everyone, music by the pool or quiet spaces if you prefer. Highly recommended. Helpful and friendly staff and amazing facilities all add up to a great holiday if you like British folk music."
Oct 2019,50,Costa del Folk,"I am looking forward already to our week at your hotel. Thank you, lovely food and wine in the sunshine with a comfortable room and leisure tim by the pool. This is our third visit to your hotel. We enjoyed the opportunity to listen to great music whilst swimming and sunbathing by the pool."
Oct 2019,50,End of season break,Travelled from our B&B for an end of season break taking in Costa del Folk.  This was our 2nd visit to this hotel and we will certainly be back.  Staff are very helpful and friendly; everywhere is kept clean and tidy;   rooms very comfortable and good choices at mealtimes.  Overall an excellent place for a holiday.
Oct 2019,50,"This is just heaven,,,,,,","Me and my partner  stayed here for 1 week ,weather was good ,we had a free bus to take us to old and new town ,the food is fantastic,  the beach  but the only thing is the water in the beach is freezing ,otherwise  fantastic hotel ,would recommend  to anyone ,the food is amazing , all we ate is fish , the rooms are cleaned every day, staff are Brill and helpful😁😁😁"
Oct 2019,50,"Grand Real Santa Eulália, offers easy beach access, with a choice of restaurants and amenities, near Old Town Albuferia","Stayed in the Main Hotel, but self catering options are also available. Lovely hotel with direct beach access. There are 5 restaurants offering a varied choice of menu, and excellent food. Rooms are decorated in typical Portuguese style, and beds are exceptionally comfortable. Staff are friendly and helpful. Although slightly outside the old town of Albufeira, there is a shuttle bus into the town daily. There is also a hairdresser, spa, gym, and small shop on site, supermarket however is situated outside of the complex approximately 10 mins walk away. There are two excellent restaurants just outside the main gates, and a would also recommend a visit to the village of Olhos del Água which has some great quirky bars."
Oct 2019,40,Good location on the beach,"We were disappointed that there was no free indoor swimming pool .To be in the heated pool is still cold .There was no entertainment in the hotel .itself .There was no activity on the beech.We ordered from with ocean  view ,we got pool view but finally beacaus it was on the first floor we prefer to stay in the room ."
Oct 2019,50,Nice hotel,"Good value for money, nice people and good location.The service of the front desk was really friendly. I’ve enjoyed my stay with the family, and would recommend it for families with small children. The kds club it great for them to play."
Oct 2019,40,Very good hotel,"Very good hotel - ideal for pleasure, business (conference facilities) and weddings ...Though I stayed here with a group of friends we all said we could return again with our children as the facilities and menu of activities on offer during peak season looked great...lots of pools across resort and the beach is at the front of the hotel(golden sand). Party strip is a short 10 min walk away. Cant fault the experience...breakfast (hot and continental) was great too!"
Oct 2019,50,Value For Money,This is a fantastic hotel set in a beautiful location. The apartments are fantastic and big. The customer service was excellent and the sea views were just stunning and the price was very reasonable for the quality of the hotel and the service you get. I'll defiantly be returning.
Oct 2019,50,Folk festival,"Very impressed with this hotel.  We are here on a package with Enjoy Travel for Costa Del Folk Portugal.  All inclusive.  Lots of choices for both breakfast and dinner.  It is my husband Peter’s birthday today and when we returned to our room this afternoon there was a trolly with a cake and a bottle of bubbly from the management waiting for us.  I had not mentioned anything to the hotel so don’t know how they found out.  Extremely impressed.  Our room is on the 2nd floor in the hotel.  Plenty of room - huge bed - large bathroom and balcony.  Overlooks entrance to hotel.  Would certainly recommend this hotel, staff very helpful and very friendly.  Oh and the weather is just right for us."
Oct 2019,50,Happy Holiday,"We had a great time staying in the hotel resort. We enjoyed every minute of it. The hotel had a high standard in terms of serving the customers(always quick response) and answering our queries. However, we would like to think that if the rooms in the resort can be more modern and less dated. The cooking facilities were generally good but if you can provide the guests with a sharper knife and washup liquid would have been much better. The shower head was a bit let down but the water pressure was fantastic. Overall we had a lovely stay . Thank you very much."
Oct 2019,50,Happy Holiday,Great Place for a nice stay. only 20 min walk to the strip if that where you want to go. Great facilitates at the hotel. staff all very friendly. when you need a cab to go out just pop in to reception  tell them and they phone for you. cabs arrive within 5 mins. Overall very enjoyable holiday here for then week. 10/10
Oct 2019,50,Amazing family holiday destination,We had a great stay. It was so convenient and luxurious. Perfect for families. Everything you needed at resort. Our baby got sick while we were there and the hotel staff had a doctor there in 20 minutes and gave us a late checkout to make it easier. Every interaction with staff was great. Would highly recommend! Loved the pools and the beach. Excellent
Oct 2019,10,Would give it zero if I could,"My friend and I booked this 5*  spa hotel as a relaxing break. It was supposed to be a much needed treat for us which we’ve never done before but it ended up in a row in the foyer with the manager who left me in tears. To set the scene we arrived on the Thursday and we were Initially told by reception that we could stay in the hotel on the day of departure (Monday) and use all the facilities and keep our luggage in the concierge room. This was also written in the guest book in the bedrooms as a standard policy as it is in most hotels. We purposely booked a late flight on the Monday home so we could get every last bit of benefit from short break. After checking into our room the young receptionist Jerome (who was the loveliest person at this hotel) sadly advised that they’d made a mistake and we couldn’t stay on the Monday as the hotel had been booked exclusively for 4 days for an event and we were informed that we would have to vacate the hotel at check out straight away but could leave our bags at the gates near the road where cars enter the grounds and we couldn’t access the grounds / restaurants again at all.  We were very disappointed to say the least and were not offered any form of recompense as an apology. To add to this initial upset the holiday continued to go downhill. We also had many issues with the restaurants. My friend can’t eat in buffet restaurants due to sauces on the food etc and this wasn’t a problem any other night as they had at least one of their other restaurants open but on the Sunday they closed all of the restaurants and used to main one to put the luggage in it from the conference guests (we were told this by the guest liaison lady) and we saw the bags stored there (we have a photo of this). This meant only buffet restaurant was open that evening. When you go to a hotel advertising a selection of restaurants you don’t expect to be left with one option on site at 32 euros a head which unfortunately isn’t actually an option due to dietary issues. On the first night we ate at the main restaurant near the foyer. I asked for a tea and was give a luke warm jug of water and t-bag. The t-bag wouldn’t do its thing as the water wasn’t hot enough so when I asked if I could have another t-bag and boiling hot water she reluctantly gave me some but then tried to charge me for two teas. At the end of the meal I asked if I could take my leftover milk from my tea to my room in the jug and she said I could take it if I paid 2 euros for it but I had to explain I’d already paid for it as it was from my tea and I only wanted to take it as i didn’t have milk in the room which is something you’d expect at a 5 star hotel. Also in the room there was only 1 of each sachet of tea/ coffee / green tea etc. Unusual for 2 guests staying. Maybe an oversight. As it turned out while we were on our “relaxing” holiday there were two conferences going on. One over the weekend with the foyer being overtaken for corporate drinks and I assume (possibly wrongly) chefs being dedicated to them which may be why the restaurants closed and the late bars being closed for those  corporate guests to enjoy. Then another conference overlapping arriving Sunday onwards. Some of the people from these events were swearing and drinking around the pool like a club 18-30’s in front of children. The staff didn’t clean up the empty cups and rubbish that were left lying around for over an hour while we were there (photo below). We were also told by the spa staff (which has a premium if you want to use it) that there was usually Pilates classes or similar on weekends but he couldn’t find them on the new sheet which the spa guy seemed confused about. Again possibly because of corporate guests being there and the classes not being needed. I can’t be sure. The “heated” pool outside was cold. The bus was only running once while we were there and hadn’t been running all week before we arrived-they said this was due to technical issues. We decided to bring up these issues with the guest liaison manager Jerome (I think that was his name-not to be confused with the receptionist Jerome) on the Sunday morning to tell him how disappointed we were with our overall experience. He talked to us like he was doing us a favour by letting us stay there and not like we’d paid money to stay there. He spoke down to us, he shouted at us, he refused to apologise to us for any inconvenience. He told me I wasn’t telling the truth about the letter on Saturday that was apparently slipped under people’s doors (I had to swear on my children’s lives we didn’t get it). This letter advised of the issue that people staying on Monday would need to vacate at check out. He made excuses for everything we brought up.  When we mentioned the restaurant being closed he said “just go to the buffet or go to the one on the beach”. He wouldn’t listen to our reasons why we couldn’t go there and the one on the beach was only open til 6pm and not open at night so he missed the point. The conversation in the foyer was recorded by a gentleman sat close by who came up to me later in the day after he saw me crying and sent me the video recordings. The highlight of the video has to be me saying “Are you not even going to apologise? He shrugged. I said “You could have offered good customer service here and offered a goodwill gesture of a bottle of wine or something as that’s what I’d have done in your situation . His rude response was “so you just want something for free- is that it?” Totally missing the point.In the end when they saw me in tears his female colleague gave him a signal that he needed to calm down. He then saw fit to apologise albeit not genuinely at first. I pointed that out and he softened. He offered wine but only sent it to our room 9 hours later when we’d been out for a meal (off-site) and we were going to bed. We ended up putting a note on the wine and leaving it for the lovely guy at reception who spoke to us on day one. Back to the conversation with the manager...I also mentioned to the manager that we’d seen previous (recent) comments on Trip Advisor about these conferences taking over the bar and foyer were they’d gone on to write that they will take comments on board but obviously that wasn’t true. He didn’t have an answer for that. The hotel in the end agreed to transfer us to their sister hotel on the Monday morning (we suggested this solution to them on day 1). Unfortunately that hotel was not in the best location. It’s not on the beach but I must say the staff in the sister hotel are lovely. All very friendly and helpful unlike Grande Santa Eulália. The people who we shared a taxi with to the sister hotel who were also turfed out like us told us that they too were shocked and even more so when Grande Santa Eulália refused to help them sort changing their airport taxi pick up from Grande Santa Eulália to their sister hotel. They’d booked it privately and having been given little notice they didn’t feel comfortable ringing the Portuguese taxi firm to explain and just wanted help but they refused. This isn’t a 5 * hotel -is it run down and it’s all about making money and not about looking after its guests unless they are corporate ones.Avoid this place at all costs. Please don’t reply to this review with “we will take your comments on board” as I know first hand that will not happen. You wouldn’t when we spoke to your manager directly and he made us feel like we were worthless hence this scathing review."
Oct 2019,50,stunning,"rooms clean, staff very helpful and knowledgeable, self catering apartments were spacious and well stocked for the kitchen. no complaints what so ever.  hotel has private beach for use by customers, absolutely 5 star treatment"
Oct 2019,50,October break,Booked this last minute after our holidays was cancelled with Thomas cook failure. We were very pleased with the hotel.top quality from the minute we arrived of the coach. Free bus was great. Taxis back were only 5 euro from new town and 10 from old town. We ate out each night so can't comment on the food. Would go back again.
Oct 2019,40,Great hotel,"Lovely hotel - we had an amazing stay. We would definitely go back 100%.  My 2 year old son had a great time. The 2 bed apartment was spacious and clean. Only downsides of the hotel: (1) food variety was severely lacking at the restaurants - this was a real problem for us; (2) they should heat all pools (not just 1), especially the kids pool; (3) loose paving stones everywhere - this is unfortunately quite dangerous when you have a 2 year old running around everywhere - please can you sort this out.Like I say - we had a wonderful time and the items I mentioned above are in no way deal breakers - we will definitely be back next year."
Oct 2019,50,Amazing hotel! ,"We recently stayed at Grande Real Santa Eulália for 4 nights and it was absolutely amazing. First of all, the staff were wonderful and super helpful! Nothing was ever too much trouble! The views from the hotel are incredible, it is truly beautiful and really is breathtaking. There a few restaurants near by which was great, and the new town, old town, Algarve shopping centre and zoo marine are just a short drive away. The free shuttle bus to the old and new town is a fantastic service! Thank you thank you thank you for an amazing holiday!"
Oct 2019,10,Awful sib standard,One of the worst hotels I've stayed in the whole place needs renovated  bed changed once no milk for tea or coffee cups never cleaned how did it get a 5 star rating I will never k now moisy the list goes on
Oct 2019,50,Great location for music event,"Stayed at this property for a week for a country music event with approx. 800 others. The staff were so helpful and the location was ""spot-on"". I  would struggle to fault it and we are certainly going back next year  to this event at this location."
Oct 2019,50,Very good,I was there for Paul Cuffley tour. It was great. Will be going again next year. I loved every minute  of my stay with you. Hope to get the same room 015. When I come next year. The beach was lovely but the sea was a bit cold
Oct 2019,40,Beautiful location. Worth a visit,"We booked a self catering villa with 2 bedrooms. This is a beautiful location and the place is worth a visit. We are a bit disappointed though, specially with the kitchenette. I think the person's responsible should pay a visit to self catering accommodations in the UK and take a lesson from that.We are strict vegetarians and we need to cook most of our meals. There are enough pots and pans and crockery. There is no washing up liquid, scourers,j-cloth, dish rack, peeler, can opener. Little things that would not cost more than £10.00 in total, but would make life easier for the guests.I hope some one will look into these small things, and do something about it.Having spent 3 nights (4 more to go) I am seeing things that aren't what one would expect from a place of this standard. I have attached a picture of the 2nd bathroom with shower. A person who is on the heavier side, would not even fit in it. I have seen small shower cubicles in my travel, but this beats then all.I wonder if all the 2 bedroom apartments have this size showers?  There is also a smell from the drains as soon as you open the door,which goes off once the exhaust hits in.On the plus side, it's clean, the staff are friendly and the beach is about 5 mins walk. If you are going out to the beach for the first time, it's not clearly sign posted so ,you might wonder if you were going the right way!"
Oct 2019,50,PAUL CLAFFEY IRISH COUNTRY MUSIC HOLIDAY,"Two of us went to the country music week, we had a brilliant time hotel was a 5 star resort in ever way.The entertainment was fab from the miniute you arrived to the time you were leaving staff and everyone you met made you feel at home. I will be recommending this holiday to my family and friends and we will be back next year. can't wait. well done to paul claffey and all his staff."
Oct 2019,50,fun week in the sun,"excellent hotel will stay here again, rooms very clean and comfortable, great location ,staff very friendly and helpful  .very close to shopping and the hotel is almost on the beach .we had a wonderful week of fun and games."
Oct 2019,40,GREAT HOTEL AND STAFF recommended,THIS HOTEL IS ONE OF THE BEST WE HAVE STAYED IN. there is very little we can say about it than its perfection at its best. Only the staff are so polite and helpful immaculately clean and the food is second to non. Truely worthy of a stay here you won't be disappointed  I took my wife here to say how sorry I was after booking out of the santa susanna resort Hotel which was disgusting to say the least
Oct 2019,50,Holiday in Portugal.,"Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at this hotel. They are exceptional, as is the hotel itself.  This was my fifth visit to this hotel and I will return again. Exemplary in every single way. Thank you."
Oct 2019,50,Paul Claffey Tour 2019,Fabulous hotel with brilliant staff who fully entered into the fun of the week. The apartment was perfectly equipped with all the necessities. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back to it again.
Oct 2019,50,Music Week,Beautiful Hotel and fantastic staff great food and very comfy bed. Would highly recommend this Hotel to any traveller for value and service brilliant location. Beautiful beach and bus services for day trips. Mona Ireland 2019
Oct 2019,50,excellent,have stayed in this hotel for the past five years. cant recommend this hotel highly enough from the minute you arrive you are treated like royalty . check in is quick reception staff are very friendly and very knowledgeable no request is too much . rooms are bright spacious and well air conditioned and who can fault the panaramc sea views . food is first class with plenty of places to dine and great variety  . definitely will be back again
Oct 2019,50,GREAT LOCATION,Situated on beach side. Bus shuttle several times a day but not at weekend takes you to the new town strip and the old town fisherman's harbour. Apartments are superb staff very friendly and all spoke good/reasonable English. Only had breakfast in hotel as past experience of evening food in restaurant not good. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance.
Oct 2019,50,Wonderful gem of a hotel on the beach,"The Grand Real Santa Eulalia is a spectacular hotel, it location is stunning right on the beach. The complex is large but still feels very friendly. The staff are incredible; nothing is too much trouble. Prices of drinks are reasonable too!"
Oct 2019,50,Paul Claffey/Joe Walsh Tours,"Great week music,dancing. Fabulous hotel,clean, staff friendly, efficient. Top Mark's. Would highly recommend.  Children welcome.Exceptional variety of food from all restaurants in and around hotel come"
Oct 2019,40,"Pleasant Stay, Great View!","We stayed at the hotel for 5 days and the location was quite and tranquil. Our room had a great view of the ocean, beach and coastline. It was in a good location about 10 minutes drive from Albufeira and about a 10 minute walk to what they call ""Crazy Street"" (it is a party town you know). The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, but was a bit tired and not as modernly appointed as other hotels. Hotel amenities are good and appropriate for a 4 star hotel. Breakfast included with room is good value with an abundant selection of foods that will not disappoint. Hotel restaraunts are priced slightly higher than other choices in the area, some of which are walking distance. However, some of these restaraunts have fantastic views of the beach and ocean. The front desk staff were always friendly and helpful. The only negative was that the hotel shuttle that was supposed to be operating daily was not operating at all during our stay so we had to uber every time. Overall a great stay and a hotel I would recommend!"
Oct 2019,50,Visit is worthwhile,"Everything was very nice in the hotel, staff courteous. I just wanted more flexibility in vegan nutrition. The staff seemed to have a little idea what vegan food is. The staff may not know the difference between vegan and vegetarian.The rented studio was perfect. It was very large, close to the main house and the beach is so easy to reach. If you want, you have peace and quiet in this hotel and if you need help, you have an excellent service at your disposal. Would go again."
Sep 2019,50,Absolutely brilliant hotel,We have just come back from this hotel from start to finish we were treated like royalty the staff could not do enough for us our bags were brought over to our apartment and so were we on a car we also booked two excursions and they got us the best deal with transfers.The rooms are spotless they are cleaned everyday I could not recommend this hotel enough they made our holiday so enjoyable they even had water and milk in our apartment oartment when we arrived and sweets for my daughter which no other place I have stayed have done .We are even looking to book again for next year .👍
Sep 2019,50,Holiday to remember,"Everything a family wants in a holiday, only negative was shittle bus never ran and for some reason when we had to be gone by 10am , when they mean off premises they mean off premises completely .Even with this is mind I'd still go back in a heartbeat"
Sep 2019,30,No 5 star,"The building is lovely but not managed to it full ability. The self catering bars weren't used and pool wasnt cleaned and tidied at night. All the effort went into the large groups of corporate larger louts. Felt like a 18-30s holiday in magaluf. There was only 2 days out of 7 where the free bus into town was provided.!! And it's too far to walk, so cost 20euro every night in taxis"
Sep 2019,40,Not a 5 Star rating,"Was in Portugal for a wedding and this was recommended by the wedding planner amongst other Hotels. It is a lovely hotel but unfortunately doesn’t reach 5 stars for me.The approach, main reception and the front of house in general is very impressive and deserves its rating, what let’s this hotel down are the rooms and breakfast, we had a sea view room 209, and although very spacious with the biggest bed I have ever seen the room is in a very tired state and needs to be upgraded, the furniture seems old and quite tatty. The bathroom is also in need of some TLC, quite a bit of mould around the bath area and on the alarm pull cord.The breakfast had a huge choice of continental and English food, problem being is that the hot food was bordering on cold every morning, even on the last morning when eating at 07:00 the temperature of the food was no different. Must say the continental choice was amazing with very fresh produce.We ate at the Restaurant by the beach and I can highly recommend it for the food and great location.Credit to all the Staff, lovely people and very helpful"
Sep 2019,40,Lovely Resort,"The resort was lovely, rooms very clean, majority of staff very  friendly. The choice of food, along with opening hours of restaurants could do with some improvement. Rooms and hotel in general are very nice and kept very clean, but are due a bit of a refurb to really give that 5 star feel. Plenty of swimming pools, access to the beach, short walk to shops and restaurants. I would return here again, and would recommend to others."
Sep 2019,50,Greeting experience,"Special anniversary 40th  wedding anniversary (ruby anniversary)but no recognition at reception when mentioned,disappointed at this response to be told happy birthday by receptionist otherwise we were happy with our experience in your hotel"
Sep 2019,50,Grande real santa eulalia,Superb hotel with superb staff .we have been staying in this hotel for a number of years and are always welcomed back by all at reception including the people who bring our luggage to the room mario in the restaurant ilidio in the Atlantic . Jorge who takes us by coach to the old town and picks us up.looking forward to going back next year
Sep 2019,50,50th Birthday Weekend,Great hotel. We arrived early and not only was our room ready we were also given an upgrade. Lovely pool with a nice pool bar ( the two young lads were very friendly )Breakfast on a morning was good and lots to chose from. The hotel is away from old town / strip but only a short Uber awayWould defiantly recommend
Sep 2019,50,Ideal for self catering,Perfect for family and relations.Ideal setting for beach and pool.Great service and quality of food.The gardens and pools were very well kept and the whole complex was a delight.Coupled with good weather this was an excellent stay.
Sep 2019,40,Nice Hotel,"Hotel was nice, lovely setting. Some miscommunication around the buffet meal was not handled well. Value for money not great for the buffet meal. Food was average for that money and in comparison with wedding food which we ate there and was exceptional."
Sep 2019,50,Aishling scott,We got Married in your hotel in September and I could not rate them any better the staff couldn't do enough on the day and the whole stay we where there...I would highly recommend it..it has something for everyone X
Sep 2019,50,Happy guest,This is the second time I have stayed. Bed and breakfast. The staff are great and helpful. Rooms were clean. Breakfast has a really good variety of foods. Pools are clean and were quiet when we went. There was always sun loungers avilable.
Sep 2019,50,Fabulous stay here from check in to check out for a wedding with friends in September..We would highly recommend it.....,We had a fantastic time here in this beautiful hotel which had so much to offer..... We stayed in September for a friends wedding and found the staff so helpful and friendly.... nothing was a problem... We would highly recommend it and ate dying to go back again....
Sep 2019,20,Has potential but the hotel needs to double-down on the basics,"I stayed for 5 nights with my wife and 2 small children (1 and 3) in a sea view junior suite - room 341.  The room really was just two adjoining rooms with a small common walk-in area.  No microwave, but had mini fridge - two separate bathrooms.  The views over the pool and sea were nice as were the two decks (each room, separated) and double-wide sliding door walls to allow more open air in the room.  The hotel ultimately has potential based on facilities, location, and resort venue, however, the general service and maintenance is lacking for the price point.  Carpet in common area halls to room need cleaning, pools and deck area had visible heavy wear (missing tiles in all pools and wooden deck was faded and had multiple broken boards.  Trash from evening before were left in pool area the next morning (seemed staff worried about specific jobs as opposed to finished product quality - e.g., straighten chairs but leave empty bottles and cups for another person who was presumably responsible).  Breakfast services was not executed properly - very rushed/busy workers, cold food (near frozen potato cakes in hot area), and lack of quality of food left us waiting for lunch most of the days.  Silly stuff annoyed as well - for example, the staff were rude on several occasions when we asked for additional napkins.  Napkins!  We had room service twice - both times food was mediocre, especially for the price.  Walkways out of the resort to the main road were fine but needed some stones reset - havoc for baby stroller and certainly not 5-star grounds maintenance.  This is the ultimate feedback.  The resort is priced for 5-star but doesn't live up to the maintenance and service that such a rating commands.  The good news is, they can fix this and have a real gem."
Sep 2019,40,Nice quiet but family friendly resort,"Lovely accommodation, nice ambience and great views from the bar/main pool. Great if you have very little ones as rooms all have good AC, there are baby pools and staff are really friendly towards them."
Sep 2019,40,A bit overpriced.,"Great location but you pay for this. The breakfasts are very good, but restaurant very busy and there seems to be a lot of waiting around for eggs to be cooked, toast to go through the slow toaster, and queues for the coffee machine."
Sep 2019,30,Hotel review - September 2019,"Me and my partner stayed here for one week in September. We felt everything was reasonably good however the customer service side could be improved on. For a 5* expectation this was not that. We were ignored by staff and walked straight passed us without any sort of greeting and we had to ask if we could order a drink! The ‘free shuttle bus’ was great when it was actually running which was not every day even though we was told it would run all day, every day.Also on our last night they had a party of 50+ people which were having drinks & chatting however the staff had placed them and the drinks in the lobby area where me & my partner were trying to have a relaxing last drink along with other families but could not hear each other talk or think because of how loud this function was, which lead us to ending our holiday to go to bed sooner than actually wanting to. Other than all that happening, the hotel is lovely. Cleanliness is top notch and good variety of breakfast, views are superb and has easy access to the private beach."
Sep 2019,50,Trip through Portugal ,"Stayed in the main hotel for 3 nights while touring the southern region of Portugal. It’s  on the beach, although it’s a bit of a hike down to the sand area. There are various pools on the hotel grounds and plenty of umbrellas for shade. While we stayed in the main hotel, there are small houses on premises to stay in. Those are a bit farther from the pool, beach and main hotel area. The facility is beautiful, there’s a health club and tennis courts as well as a spa. The rooms are roomie, but our bathroom looked nothing like the ones pictured on their site. We had a room in the main hotel overlooking parking lot on 1st floor. Could not open curtains because there was no privacy. The internet worked well where our room was located. Breakfast which was included was wonderful. Great choices and lots of variety for everyone. Even champagne for mimosas at breakfast. There’s a restaurant for dinner, but it’s only buffet. Across the street from the hotel grounds is a great pizza restaurant “Portabella”where we ate two times. This hotel is not near the old city, it’s about a 10-15 min cab ride. Not many stores around the hotel. Great place to stay for a quite few days at the beach and if you have transportation."
Sep 2019,20,Needs Serious Upgrade Maintenance,"We have been coming to this hotel for 16 years and this is the first year we have considered not coming back. The apartments are in need of serious upgrades work, they are tired, mold on the walls, dated decor and in general just unkept. Its very disappointing as we love the location and hotel but the accommodation is letting it down now. Nothing has changed in 16 years !!!!"
Sep 2019,50,First Class Hotel,Truly the best accommodation we have ever stayed in.  Everything about the resort is 5* from the Reception Desk to the cleanliness not only in the apartment but all around the resort.  Lovely swimming pools.  Clean towels .  Free courtesy bus to the Strip and Old Town.  The breakfast is out of this world so much choice.  Our little boy loved his stay he cried when leaving.  Keep up the amazing standards .   Our paradise
Sep 2019,50,Weekend break,"Wow what a resort this was. Absolutely incredible, from arrival to departure. All staff were So friendly. Perfect location, beach, the bars service, food and accommodation. Would highly recommend to family friends and would definately be returning"
Sep 2019,40,last minute holiday,"Hotel classed as five star but would say this was now a four star.Needs some updating in places furniture and decor in rooms quite old fashioned and dark.Electric sockets in inaccessable places,no shaving mirror difficult to see in bathroom mirror because of wide sink unit and down lights.Food disappointing  for a five star hotel lack of choice and never hot enough.No hand saniitiizers anywhere.Hotel in ideal position for a lovely beach.Staff friendly and helpful.Arrived 5th Sept to find a lot of children of all ages at the hotel which made it quite noisy around the pool area and in the dining room at evening meal time.Was surprised that there was no dress code in the restaurant at night with quests in shorts and teeshirts looking as if they had just come off the beach."
Sep 2019,40,Amazing holiday,Location of hotel was amazing with private gate access to A lovely small beach. Customer service was top notch with staff going above and beyond to help out. Downfalls would be beds were 2 single beds put together and not tied in so not ideal with your partner also food was pretty poor. we was on a bed and breakfast and breakfast was nice but paid once for dinner and selection was really poor and over priced.
Sep 2019,50,Our nice vacation,"Very nice location.Very frendly staff.We enjoy every day being  in in the hotel ,out to the beach,on the swimming pool.The snake bar was very good as hamburger restaurant.The only think I will suggest for the future to look on the sleeping pillows, they are,good but not enough harder some times to have a good sleep on them,beside this everything was excelent."
Sep 2019,40,very good,"beautiful clean relaxing efficient beautiful clean relaxing efficient structure in a strategic position to visit the entire Algarve region, direct access to the beach, advisable for all types of customers. Available and efficient staff, even if the use of English is not at the top"
Sep 2019,40,Change the decor for 5 stars!,"The resort is absolutely stunning. Everything is at your fingertips there. The staff were lovely. My only complaint is about the room itself, and all the corridors too actually. The decor is horrendous. Beds are uncomfortable, as are the pillows. The rooms are not what you'd expect from a 5 star resort, but everything else about the place is 5 star."
Sep 2019,50,Love this hotel,"Have been here before, lovely location and staff are very welcoming. Stayed for our anniversary and were surprised by a bottle of bubbly and some treats being delivered to our suite, really made our day, thank you management.Rooms are older in style, no walk in showers ( jacuzzi bath in one of our bathrooms), very comfortable and the sea view suites are worth the extra - lovely large balconies and a great view. We dined at the buffet restaurant most nights - could not fault the selection, plenty of fresh salads, different hot dishes and good selection of cheeses, desserts, fresh fruit and ice cream. Breakfast buffet was excellent, as was lunchtime selection. You can eat inside or on the terrace and the staff are very attentive.  We also ate at the fish restaurant overlooking the beach and had a wonderful meal at a very reasonable price. Cannot fault the food or service.  Right on the lovely beach but a fair walk into Albufeira old town, but there is a free shuttle bus available.Pools are cleaned regularly, early morning, as is the rest of the hotel - spotless throughout. Plenty of sun loungers and grassy areas in shade and sun, so you can always find somewhere to relax.  Very happy with our stay and look forward to returning."
Sep 2019,50,Amazing hotel with breathtaking views and superb staff,"We were impressed by this hotel and it’s staff!We are just back from our amazing holiday - the Grand Real Santa Eulalia is a great resort with so much to do! Our studio was clean, comfortable (the bed was squeaky though) and well equipped, it was just a few minutes walk from the main hotel facilities. The views from the hotel are just spectacular, the buffet breakfast is tasty (could potentially be improved further by offering freshly made pancakes or omelettes), the pools are good (there are 3 pool areas as its a big resort) and our daughter loved going to the kids club - big thanks to the staff there (Claudia, Miguel, Jessica and the others, sorry, cannot remember all names but you are all great). Reception and waiting staff are very helpful and friendly also (our favourite was a middle aged gentleman at breakfast who called himself Jonny B Good, our daughter found him hilarious:) ). Very very pleasant stay!"
Sep 2019,50,to arrive and feel good,"The servred bufet food for Breakfast and Dinner was amazing, especially for Vegetarian! We would like to come again. Special thanks for the Brithday cake and champaigne, zhis was a nice surprise.It wolud be nice, when smoking is forbidden also in outside restaurant."
Sep 2019,50,Most beautiful hotel in the area!!,I’m currently staying here and think this hotel is absolutely wonderful. We were upgraded to a one apartment without even asking. The staff are soo nice and helpful. The views are breathtaking! Our room whilst traditional was a delight and colourful and very roomy and very comfortable for us. Definitely 5 star!! Would come back!!
Sep 2019,50,Comfortable stay at Algarve,"We stayed 10 days at GRSE and enjoyed it very much. The service was excellent and friendly, the buffets and meals extraordinary. We listend most of the evenings to the smooth music duo on the bar floor, much better than the often celebrated shows or animations.A special thank to Joåo of the Gym team. He gave an excellent class in Pilates and Gap."
Sep 2019,30,Extremely rude Front of House!,"I was treated appallingly at check-in! I was a bride checking in with my mother & friend the night before. The very rude & incompetent girl checking us in made me feel upset & embarrassed at how we were treated. She kept walking away when she didnt know what to do next! Asking me silly questions and when I didnt have a credit card on me she insisted my groom (who i wasnt to see until the wedding) would hv to come to show his instead of being lenient seeing as our wedding was being held there next day! Everything was a problem. She finally ""made an exception"" and used my debit card but at that point I had to walk away as I was so upset. Another ""guest"" rudely stood in front of us with her own issue with a staff member and shouted at us which added to my distress. I couldn't believe this was happening when i expected to be made feel welcome as any guest should especially a bride! Would not call this a 5 star hotel. Room service was ridic slow too.Very disappointed.."
Sep 2019,40,Great views ,"Hotel situated in great location to the public beach. Receptionist are helpful and friendly.  We stayed in room 331 though it's big it's dated and few damages in walls.We had views to the side of the garden, sea view and across to new town. There are costs for tea and coffee in the room and we only got a bottle of water on our arrival day. Shops are 10 mins walk away from the hotel left and right side from entrance gate to get milk and other snacks.  Bringing your own tea and coffee and dried milk from home would be advisable. Also advise to bring snacks from home as the exchange rate is very poor at present and costly in supermarkets.It cost to use the sun beds and umbrellas on the beach because it is not part of the hotel. Swimming pool is great for kids and adults to soak in after catching the sun.Breakfast has a great variety for all. We only took the option on bed and breakfast. There is great snack bars in the hotel, typical hotel prices.There is a fish restaurant which is great but costly because the fresh fish on the grill is priced according to weight. But tasty.Overall a quiet and family friendly hotel."
Sep 2019,50,A wonderful stay with friends,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Comfortable,  clean, friendly staff and a very comfortable bed. A few steps down on to the beach if preferred, but we were more than happy by the pool. A wonderful few days, just wished it had been for longer."
Sep 2019,50,Great hotel,"Had a fab time in this resort - attended a family wedding on the premises and stayed in one of the apartments - on arrival we were pleasantly surprised by an upgrade from a studio to a 1-bedroom apartment. In general we found the staff lovely, great location, would come again."
Sep 2019,50,Fantastic Family Holiday,"Myself,husband and 2 kids stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment that would have easily slept 6 if needed.The apartment was in excellent location,the pool was literally outside our door....the only thing was the apartment could do with paint inside and the wardrobe in main room had slight smell of must when opened.The sofa bed in living area has seen better days and was extremely uncomfortable to sleep on so new mattress needed on that.The staff overall were very helpful and kind,the only downfall was one evening we went to main hotel for the buffet style dinner,the staff failed to tell us that there was a separate kids station separated from the adults,kids inside..adults outside....our 2 kids ate noodles from The adult station as we presumed this was for them aswell and on leaving the member of staff charged my husband for 4 adults.....as the staff had not explained to us where kids station was I thought this to be very wrong.....but my husband said nothing and just paid...typical.The beach bar through the back gates is lovely for lunch and drinks...perfect location,basic but tasty food.The shuttle bus service from hotel into new and old town is great service.Overall ,we had a fabulous holiday and were very relaxed and comfortable,I would reccomend to any families looking for comfort and convenience as everything you need is in the resort....maybe just bring some of those nice lavender pouches to hang in wardrobes😎"
Sep 2019,10,Dreadful,"Horrific experience from start to finish. Mostly down to poor staff engagement i.e. none at all. Better places to stay nearby for a similar price where one might be treated better, particularly taking on board that this nasty experience was not exactly cheap."
Sep 2019,30,"Average breakfast , awful internet",Check in was awful! We arrived t 10 am check in was about 3 pm ! I asked them alittle earlier because of my child they told me room is not ready ! But I saw lots of guests after me came they had in time check in !and quick they got their room ! Reception told me every room are different  ! Awful food in restaurant! Breakfast fast was so average! I have been in lots of 5 stars hotels in the world but this hotel hadn’t good food and breakfast at all . Also I hadn’t at ll internet in my room . So many time I complain but it didn’t work out !
Sep 2019,40,Good faciities and food,"The hotel is well situated and appointed although, truth be told, it is beginning to look a little tired and frayed round the edges. However the rooms are large and comfortable. We had a seaview on the 2nd floor and it was excellent with a great view. The  bed was also enormous!We were on full board - which might have been a mistake as we were restricted to eating in the main restaurant. We selfishly would have liked to be served for the evening meal rather than have everything buffet style all the time.However such was the choice and quality of the food this was not a problem. To be fair, it is more a family hotel although as an older couple we were perfectly OK.All in all, we had a restful and pleasant time."
Sep 2019,50,Spotless Hotel - Great service and facilities,"Fantastic Hotel, genuinely spotless - You could eat off the floors! We stayed here in July having never been in Portugal before. We had one of the Studio apartments - south facing with a more private internal Garden and Pool Area so no early bird competition for sunbedsThe apartment was Spacious and generous - bit of an outfdated colour scheme to be honest but we didnt mind. A Large zip locked superking Bed and a pull out bed in the living room.The Main Hotel pool was well laid out - the pools are smaller but more intimate and easy to keep track of the kids.The Hotel is linked to the Beach with Beach side reasturant and bars - we honestly didn't leave the hotel much apart from trips to the Oldtown or Zoomarine.Honestly a fantastic hotel and friendly efficient service. My only gripe was the Kids club was located in the Basement Conference centre - probably needed more thought as was too out of sight. Additionally the Nights entertainment could have been more lively. We could hear other hotels and longed for the same but we are aware this is not how they market the place. There is a free bus service to the town during the day and there are great Restaurants just outside the gates, Pizza and Steak with Portuguese dishes.All in all a fantastic place and i hope this review gives others no doubt on which to choose."
Sep 2019,30,Not a 5 star hotel,We spent our holidays at Santa Eulalia in August 2019. The staff are very friendly and helpful but the hotel itself is in dire need of maintenance and is quite decadent. We stayed in the resort apartments and the lack of maintenance is notabley severe. It is a shame as we stayed at this hotel 10 yrs ago and it is clear that this hotel is not maintained properly. It is certainly not deserving of 5 stars. The employees deserve 5 stars but not the hotel itself.
Sep 2019,40,A pleasant stay but could have been more welcoming,"We got married here in 2009 and this hotel really had the wow factor. We returned this year for our ten year wedding anniversary with our two children who hadnt visited before. I feel the hotel is looking a little tired in places and could do with a revamp. The views and the beach are just unbelievable and are amazing to see again. We told the hotel we were there for a special occasion and were basically told by reception...'people get married here everyday and return all the time', so we were not made to feel like special guests who had returned to mark a special occasion. We tried to ask for complientary spa passes to use the jacuzzi but we were declined. Overall the room is  very comfy and the hotel is clean, Some of the staff could be friendlier and we would always return as it hold such special memories for us. Hopefully our next visit we would recieve a better service."
Sep 2019,50,Excellent Family Vacations,"Very good facillities.Services are great and employees sympathy are even better.Best Kids Club that I know. My daughter just love it!No need to leave the hotel, good food, amazing views, relaxed pools and beatiful beach..."
Sep 2019,40,Lovely Family Holiday,"Location next to the beach and sea are perfect and beautiful. Stayed here with our 2 children (6&8). Pools were perfect, staff lovely and couldn’t do enough for you. Rooms were fine, we stayed in the self catering part. The only critique is the pool area and rooms need updating. Bit tired."
Sep 2019,50,Short stay,"Just returned from 4 night stay at the grande Santa Eulalia in albufeira and was very happy with all the facilities on offer and really appreciated the ground floor garden room as it let us sit outside instead of on a balcony the room could benefit from updating. The staff were excellent will stay again if possible . room service for an early 4am breakfast was appreciated, thanks to all"
Aug 2019,50,5 stars,"5 stars! Great hotel, nice staff, excelente location and an amazing beach! The bedroom was always impeccable.   You can listen everyday to live music. They give information about all kind of programs you can do in the area. The bed it's very comfortable.Amazing!"
Aug 2019,50,Lovely hotel very relaxing will stay again,"This is a lovely hotel, the staff are wonderful and very helpful. Has 3 pools which arent big , one is saltwater and cold but very refreshing after a lot of sunbathingWe stayed b&b food was good with a wide choice, gets busy after 9 am..No issue or rush for sunbeds which is fantastic - fresh towels daily ..Rooms are really nice and spacious. we had no issues with noisy people or cars outside ( we overlooked the car park) had the option of a sea view but expensive.Hotel is approx 10 mins drive from the Old and New Town but theres a free bus that runs back and fwd ( last return is early) we always got a taxi back around 8 euros .Hard to think of any gripes but  if i was pushed - drinks next to the pool are very expensive 3.5 euros for a small pepsi 3 euros for a bottle of water will be back !The hotel is next to a lovely beach thats busy but not crowded"
Aug 2019,20,So so,"Room on the ground floor with an open balcony to some trees, not much of a view.The room felt dated, a bit cramped and not so secure as the sliding doors didn't seem to close properly. AC didn't work properly, bathroom felt dated for a 5 star hotel.Beds&&pillows weren't that comfortable.The best thing all in all was the breakfast."
Aug 2019,30,Mediocre.. wouldn't stay again,"Our stay here was okay at best. Our room felt very dated. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and were sort of bummed that upon check-in, our room wasn't finished being cleaned and set up. After we dropped our luggage the staff came back into our room and gave us water. Our minibar wasn't stocked. The toilet seat in the bathroom was broken, the shower drain was broken and my husband had to pry it out. There was mold in-between the tiles in the bathroom. The floors creaked really terribly, and the walls are very thin so we heard everyone all the time. The bed was very uncomfortable and the pillows were flat so we used our clothes as pillows for more support. The AC didn't work very well. We felt it wasn't worth what we had paid for."
Aug 2019,40,Relaxing Holiday,"A good hotel, with lots of internal facilities, Activities, and spacious.The location is good in one respect as it's away from all the Hustle & Bustle of Albufeira but there's nothing outside of the Hotel except 2 separate Restaurants. You need to taxi or use the shuttle bus to get to the New Town Or Old Town. The beach is a beautiful beach, but gets extremely busy in high season as there is a part for Hotel Guests, but it's also open to the public. We didn't use the beach, we preferred the pool area, which was quiet spacious and there are other Pools for the Apartments, but everyone seemingly choose the main pool of the hotel?The Hotel takes lots of guests in Hotel Rooms and Apartments, however this was over crowded at Breakfast. Queues for Breakfast went back all the way up the staircase every morning- so you need to be an early riser!!!Our room was a standard Classic Room, it was cleaned daily with fresh towels and the bed made in exceptional turn around times! The house keeping maid was an absolute gem!The Room it's self was very tired looking and dark because of the decor. (room 215) It did not rate as 5 star to me. The wooden furniture was marked, the upholstery was marked on the stools and the arm chair & just felt a little bit scruffy. It also did not look like the other rooms with floral curtains etc that i managed to catch a glimpse of.The camp bed that was supplied for my daughter had seen better days- call it more of a rack with the most saddest mattress I ever saw, although on mentioning this to reception this was sorted within the morning, and a new mattress replaced.The Hotel had a leaflet with all the activities and facilities listed which was given on arrival. This was helpful to find out what was going on and when. The Hotel and staff were all very pleasant and nothing was too much trouble. It's a very big hotel and apartment complex and well laid out. It has a good location if you want solitude from Albufeira it's self."
Aug 2019,50,A wonderful stay,"Very friendly service, different pool-locations, excellent food, all in all a very pleasant stay,a little bit too many people on the beach, it would be nice, if there were a separate place only for the hotel-guests"
Aug 2019,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa,Quality accommodation. Would definitely stay again. Own beach minutes from room. Plenty of pools. Not far from old town and new town. New town is within walking distance. Old town 7-8 euros in a taxi.
Aug 2019,40,Nice Hotel centrally located!,"Staff was helpful at checkin. Rooms are nice. The gift shop was helpful in assisting me with replacement swimsuit, coverup, and sunglasses as my suitcase never left Brussels. The concierge was super helpful in arranging guided experiences for me. I enjoyed them all. My only two complaints are small ones. The breakfast buffet needs set seating times for guests as the last minute stampede had a line of families and children backed up out the door and up the steps. The breakfast wasn’t great. When I had an early tour pickup scheduled, the staff in the dining room declined to give me any sort of breakfast to go. This seemed petty and unnecessary, I’m not a big eater and the front desk could easily verify my 7:30am ride to Faro for a Marine Wildlife tour. The hot water pots in the rooms are essential for me. The hot water pot in my room had such a short cord that I couldn’t plug it in without moving the table and setting the pot on the floor."
Aug 2019,50,Excellent facilities,"This is an excellent hotel for families - plenty of pools suitable for very young children through to adults, and plenty of sun-loungers and sun shades. We had an apartment with two bedrooms, two bathrooms a living room and kitchen plus a small balcony, which was ideal for 4 adults and a 4 year old. All kept spotlessly clean. Breakfasts were good and the buffet style dinners were adequate rather than special - we ate out on half of the days we were there. Hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful. There is access to the beach which was quite nice, but hire of loungers and sun shade at €10 a pop could be expensive (the beach does not belong to the hotel and the sun loungers are a private operation. We preferred the pools anyway as the 4 year old was more confident in the pool than the sea. The hotel offers a shuttle bus into Albufeira - lovely beach but VERY crowded and Albufeira itself is a bit tacky. If you have kids Zoomarine is a great day out  - combination of rides and marine creatures - dolphin shows, sea-lions, tropical birds etc. Kids need to be over 1M tall to go on some of the rides. Costs €29 for adults €21 for kids. Taxi about €25 each way."
Aug 2019,50,5 day stay with 5 year-old,"I was alone with my son and the place made it easy to entertain him all day with pools beach and the amazing kids club. The staff were amazing, the variety of food amazing, proximity to the beach, parking options. Great location and place to stay. Would definitely stay again."
Aug 2019,50,"Absolutely perfect, again....","Just stayed here for the 3rd time (same room requested and provided with each time) and the place is simply perfect in every way, i cannot fault anything. Thanks and Well done guys, keep up the great work!"
Aug 2019,50,Best Algarve resort ever,"Where can I start. There was a wide variety of food, clean apartment, amazing spa treatments, kids club that runs quite late into the evening, so many restaurants, bars and swimming pools we were spoilt for choice. Located right on the beach with beautiful views. Staff that will go over and above to make you feel welcome. All outstanding. Can't wait to come back."
Aug 2019,50,Summer Holiday,"Excellent Holiday. From checking in to leaving we had a great holiday. Its the people that work at the hotel that make this hotel so good. Special mention to the kids club staff my daughter loved going to ""holiday school"" as she called it. The restaurants and bars were very good especially Santa Eulalia and Pergula Burger Restaurants. Reception staff and also cleaning team very friendly and efficient. The General Manager runs a great hotel. Thank You we will return."
Aug 2019,40,A Pleasant Stay,"Apartment Clean, bright, cheery & spacious with a well equipped kitchenette.Food & DrinkBreakfast time is very busy but there is plenty on offer as at lunch and dinner including a kids section which is handy.We did full board on check-in you’re given vouchers to present at lunch and dinner however you can only use them in the main buffet restaurant which was disappointing.Complimentary drinking / tap water would have been a nice touch this is only available at breakfast which I think is a shame.PoolPlenty of sun loungers I saw little evidence of the towel reserving nonsense that you often get on holiday.The Staff Everyone that we encountered were friendly and polite.BeachIt gets extremely busy, access involves negotiating quite a few steps.The sea was freezing - not for the faint hearted!!Use of sun loungers / umbrella costs 15 euros for the day (I don’t believe this has anything to do with the hotel).Entertainment I didn’t notice much but I wasn’t particularly fussed. Overall we had a nice relaxing stay."
Aug 2019,50,Highly recommended for any type of holiday!,"As a family of 4, 2 girls aged 12 & 15 we decided against All inclusive this year but still wanted the luxury of a 5star resort. This is what we got even with self catering, something we haven’t done before. The holiday started as soon as we got there without waiting for our room which was a bonus!! We were in at 11.30am!! Previous reviews have knocked the apartments but ours must’ve been recently redecorated because we couldn’t fault it. Beds were comfortable, plenty of storage, 2 bathrooms and the cleaners came in every day. From reading a previous review, he suggested leaving a tip on the first day which I did, unfortunately we never had the same cleaner!! Typical!! But they all did the same so the first one got a bonus ha ha!! There are 2 pools one on each side with a smaller one for babies in the apartments area but beware they are cold! Then in the hotel there are 2 further pools one is slightly warmer (supposed to be heated). you can take your time going for sunbeds too, we would go down at 10.30 and there would be loads but would go from one pool to another and always find beds!! Not the typical 7/8am rush to put your towels to reserve... amazing!! You can put money on an account when arriving so you can make use of the pool bar which is a good idea too. My only 2 negatives would be the towels to hire are a bit worn and the decking is a bit shabby. If you drop anything between the large gaps ie a phone or room card (the gaps are that big) there’s no chance of retrieving them. But I will say the food we had was out of this world along with the drinks, more expensive but that’s to be expected in such a fabulous hotel. The staff were very polite and friendly who would always help and couldn’t do enough for you. If you need a supermarket, turn left it’s a 10 minute to a larger one with more choice and cheaper with additional shops and food outlets, turn right and there’s another for emergencies, less choice and more expensive but only 5 minutes away. We thoroughly enjoyed our holiday!"
Aug 2019,50,      2nd To None 2nd Time Round,"My wife and I came to Grand Real Hotel last year to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday 🎂🎉💏 and had a fantastic time. We came back this year with our four children (7, 9, 11, 13) and I can honestly say it was even better than the first time.After booking two seaview rooms, we emailed the hotel prior to our arrival to request the rooms were next to each other, with extra beds in each room for the younger children. We also requested to stay in the same room we had stayed last year (309) as it had fantastic views of the sea and beach. The hotel accommodated our request and it was all in place by the time we arrived... Happy days!As a surprise from the hotel, we had a bottle of Moët and Chandon with exotic fruits, chocolates and sweets waiting for us in each room when we arrived! We really appreciate this warm gesture from the hotel and it definitely set the tone of our holiday experience. Thanks to Ines and her wonderful team for the fantastic service and hospitality we recieved👍🏾😘🤗.We had booked the bed and breakfast option, but enquired with the hotel before arriving to ask if we could add dinner on for a few days. They said we could, so we purchased 5 vouchers for the main restaurant to use for either dinner or lunch on 5 days of our choosing. This was quite nice as we could choose when to eat in the hotel and when to eat out.Food at the hotel is the best that I have experienced. The buffet breakfast is excellent with lots of choice for adults and children, although I would love to see the hotel include pastel de nata (a popular Portuguese pastry) as part of their breakfast options in the future, yum yum 😋.The dinner varied every evening with different themed options, such as Algavarian, BBQ, Portuguese, Chef's Flavour and Latino, all very tasty, with lots of choice for the children as well. Drinks do not come free with lunch or dinner.There is a massive tennis court on the hotel premises (€10 to hire bats and balls), an excellent kids club with different daily activities including some trips outside the hotel, and a cash machine (charges €3.95 for withdrawals).The beach is close to the hotel and you can use your room key to access it via a private security gate.  Along the front of the beach there are a few restaurants with lovely sea views. The hotel also has a free shuttle bus into the old town and new town. There are a few restaurants near the hotel, and a 15 minute walk will get you to a Supermarche and Spar to stock up if you are self catering.Also, if you ever require a taxi, restaurant booking or excursion sorting out, the hotel reception team are always available to arrange this for you - they were really helpful making restaurant reservations for us when we wanted to eat out in the Old town and also helped us phone our airport transfer company when an issue arose.There are 3 pools onsite, a seawater pool which is cold, a normal pool which is heated and a toddlers pool. My wife absolutely loved the seawater pool, while the children preferred the heated pool.You have a choice of paying for food and drink items in the hotel on PAYG or you can choose the service of charging to the room. In this case your bank card will be requested for security purpose and an amount equal to €50/day will be taken from your card. Any unused amount will be refunded to your account. In conclusion, the customer service at Grande Real Santa Eulalia is excellent, the atmosphere is fantastic,  the food is delicious and your children will love the kids club.I highly recommend this hotel and I unquestionably plan to return again in the future.Obrigado to all members of staff on the reception at GRSEH 👍👏"
Aug 2019,50,July 2019 Stay,Our family stayed from end of July/August 2019 and previously in July 2017. We had a wonderful experience and every aspect of the stay (front-of-house and general services) were excellent. We stayed on a self-catering basis as it suited the needs of our young family and for this reason didn't review the restaurants but perhaps we will look at all-inclusive for future stays. Thanks again for making our holiday wonderful and relaxing and we look forward to seeing you next year.
Aug 2019,40,Not bad,"Overall, this hotel is very good. Love the breakfast/dinner buffet. Location is great. few mins walk to the beach.The only thing we don't like is the room/washroom. It's a bit old fashion though and not very clean."
Aug 2019,50,Loved it here!,"Had my wedding here, was amazing, everything down to the food, the service, the stunning views, it was my perfect day and more.Had a lovely two week stay, the staff are so welcoming and helpful. Breakfast is superb but does get busy after 9.30. Loved it and definitely will return"
Aug 2019,50,Great stay,"Stayed for 7 nights again this year. Fantastic location, lovely hotel and excellent staff. Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff.We did half board for convienience and while the food is great, it is a buffet service. Next year I think we will just do b&b as it's nice to have a choice of eating in the other restaurants."
Aug 2019,40,Nice but a bit tired in places.....,Hotel is located the other side of old town cost you 8 euros in taxi. Last courtesy bus is at 630pm so you have no choice if want to go there. Some restaurant in walking distance but prefer old town. Hotel is gig with apartments located at front as you drive then main hotel behind these. You can use pools in all areas but stayed around main hotel.pools small circular 1 salt water the other fresh apparently heated but not sure about as took until afternoon for it to become comfortable enough. Plenty of loungers around pools so no need to panic about leaving towels down early. Stayed in suite which had 2 rooms & bathrooms of good size with 2 balconies. Cleanliness ok but showing signs of wear tear in places. Staff very friendly and dealt with any queries we had. Pool towels given out typical hotel quality and very used as you can imagine.  Breakfast choice very good and quality the same best go before 9.00am as it gets very busy after this. Had lunch in restaurant at beach which is below hotel and is there private section with loungers food not great. Used the gym which was of a good standard and choice of equipment. Overall nice but not sure if value as could do with a face lift in places.
Aug 2019,40,Aug 2019,This was my 5th time returning to Grande Real. The apartments need  redecorating as paint coming off walls and the beds and pillows are certainly not 5 star. Beds are rock hard and pillows very poor quality .
Aug 2019,50,Resort on the beach,This hotel has a private beach but family rooms are not seaview which is a disappointment.buffet has various dishes.All the staffs are courtious and helpful. Family rooms are quite big with kitchenett.
Aug 2019,50,"Fabulous Hotel, Staff and Facilities","Went in July, first time in Portugal. The hotel was spotless, the wide range of restaurant's, bars, pools, activities meant you didn't need to leave the hotel. There is access to the beach from the hotel. Our room had every home convenience we needed. Definitely going back."
Aug 2019,40,Very good resort with some reservations,"A very nice and clean resort with fantastic and friendly service and very good location. However, it is expensive for what you get (by any standard - I’m from the US and have travelled extensively). The food was great - no big complaints there. There are multiple pools, well kept, but they are all small round ones (ie. no lanes and they get crowded fast)."
Aug 2019,40,A great place to explore the Algarve,"The resort is at a beautiful place, in a small bay between the brown rocks. We booked an apartment, there was a nice place, but there would be some things to refurbish ... We booked only breakfast, it was tasty, but every day it was the same..."
Aug 2019,10,First day here and already a nightmare!,"We booked here for 5 days... Bad point 1-  cost 3000 euros for 2 adults and 3 kids for 5 days for half board only!!!!Bad point - 2:  We had to booked 2 rooms... and they couldn't guaranty to have them communicating.Bad point - 3: for this price, be prepared.... no private beach!!!! I'm will cost you 20 euros per day for one beach umbrella... We are five so I will let you calculate the additional cost for 5 daysBad point - 4: we decide to not pay the see beach... We fall back to the swimming pool....nothing more than 3 ridiculously little pool.. don't except to swim thereBad point - 5: you have to battle to find sunbeds... and absolutely no beach umbrella available! I let you imagine with 3 5, 8 and 8...  sunburn and sunstroke granted....And all this in my first hour here....With all the additional costs that will come for our meals due to the half board, all our drinks and all the paying activities at the kid club.... yes yes all the funny one are not free!!! This will be bad point- 6!I'll let you know the rest during our stay... if we don't evade before that....Just a suggestion, book at the Club Med instead... more expensive at the beginning but everything is included!!!!"
Aug 2019,50,Self catering apartment bliss!,One bed apartment for a family of four had me worried prior to arrival but large double room with a single and a double in the lounge dining area was generous in size and never left us feeling cramped. Great hotel facilities with range of bars and pools - beach access from hotel and a few nice restaurants in walking distance - less than 10euros to taxi it into Oldtown and Newtown a 10minute walk. Personally I’d avoid both and do a much calmer relaxed Ochoa del Acqua nearby.
Aug 2019,40,6 Days Break to Portugal,"I visited this hotel with my best friend for 6 day break from 18th July-24th July.I have to say the hospitality we recieved from the staff was amazing. Portugese people uin general are SO SO SO nice. We got there abit early and went to check in, we paid for a standard view but th guy at the desk put us in a side view instead which had the garden view and some sea too which was nice, considering we didnt even pay for the sea view.  So i thought that was really nice. We couldnt go in our room so we asked the hotel conceirge about what he recommended for lunch as we were starving and we were shocked to know this hotel had about 5 resturants. We ended up eating at the resturant near the beach. The snack resturant. It was great and great service. Then we were shocked to see how close the beach was. Literally our hotel was on the beach. Like 10 secs away! Beach was busy but was amazing. Sea was just amazing!! Then we went back and went to our room. To be honest, the room does need updating. Its very clean and nice but the beds were a little creaky. Also, the pool was very cold. If it was heated that would be AMAZING. But because the staff were so nice, we didnt mind. Then we decided to go down and speak to the concierge about dinner. I have to give recognition to JEROME, the concierge, he was just fantastic. Every resturant he recommended was AMAZING. We were sad we didnt get a chance to say bye! So please send our thank yous to him. I hope he can see this message! Breakfast Buffet was good lots of variety and very tasty, however i feel they  should make it bigger because every morning there were SOOO many people so you would get abit overwhlemed. Also the omlette station wasnt very clear either. I think that could be improved. Overall i was very happy with this Hotel and my stay. Food was amazing. We had the seafood resturant (recommended by JEROME) one night and it was AMAZING!!!! I would recommend. I think it was called Oura...near the beach. We also had the Hamburger one Pergula..i think...that was just OUT OF THIS WORLD, best burgers ever. Honestly the only thing I would say is that the hotel rooms need to be updated a little and the breakfast hall should be extended. But other than that, please go and visit this hotel. I dont think you will be disappointed. I would 100% go back!!!"
Aug 2019,40,Summer Holidays,"Relaxing, family holiday. Beds and pillows need replaced. Rooms need upgraded as do the apartments. They are in real Portugese style but are outdated now.John the baggage/towel attendant was very attentive and very pleasant - nothing was ever too much!"
Jul 2019,50,"Excellent, again. ","I reviewed this hotel last year after visiting for the first time. We’re just back from a second trip. We requested and got the same apartment- they did well to give us this and we were very happy they could as it was ideal last year. Staff are very accommodating. Food is mostly excellent. Breakfast is best. Dinner is overkill and not as good, but it is worth it for a long slow meal with free wine (voucher given on check in). Pools are great, gym each morning is very quiet, small but well equipped. Beach is next door and amazing, especially early morning. We’ll be back next year. A couple of things I hope the hotel can answer, which are of slight concern for next year and beyond. All the wood across the resort is rotten and in need of repair. Signs, decking, verandas all falling apart... Tiles on the pool floor are chipped or missing and hurt when you catch your foot on them. Cobbles on the paths are missing, so there are holes in the road. The whole place needs ‘a lick of paint’. Had this been our first visit we might not have rated so highly based on these flaws, but knowing how perfect it was last year, we overlooked them and the stay was again almost perfect this year. I hope the hotel has a plan to fix these issues in the off season, prior to next summer. If not they will certainly create a shabby and tired resort by next year. 10/10 last year. 8.5 this year. As for comments regarding it not/being a five star. It is, clearly. It isn’t the ritz or savoy but in Europe terms and in a hotel of this scale, it is five star. It is noticeably better than similar resorts that are four star. This could change if the problems above aren’t addressed."
Jul 2019,40,Lovely Propery .Everything we required with 2 kids,Lovely hotel in lovely location.Plenty of pools and beach to choose from.A couple of good restaurants nearby.Good service.Rooms cleaned to a high standard everyday.No problem getting beds by pools .Didn't like Albufeira as a bit manic for kids but if you turn right when you come out of hotel there is a lovely beachside place called Olhios de Augua that is worth a visit.All in all we had a great holiday.
Jul 2019,50,Second visit ,"I love this hotel, it is exactly what you want, the kids have a fantastic time nothing is too much for the staff and the hotel are so accommodating, the spa is a real treat and gym is comfortable.... I couldn't fault it. Thank you so much for a great holiday!"
Jul 2019,40,The perfect family beach holiday!,"Lovely hotel with lots to do!Tricky to locate, but its position on the coast and proximity to the beach and shops is perfect. Ample parking available ... and it feels very safe.Reception team was warm and welcoming. Check-in easy and fuss-free. Concierge available but plenty of information provided throughout the hotel. Room spacious, especially for our baby and pram (we were given a disabled persons room). They also kitted it out with a cot as per our request. Thank you! The room was clean and comfortable. A few maintenance bits to take care of, but nothing standing out as an eyesore. Fridge and kettle provided. TV reception and channel options excellent.  Wifi availability, access and speed throughout the entire hotel was very impressive, even at the pool.Pools, activities and beach no more than a hop, skip and a jump. Very satisfied! Pools were very well maintained and clean. Pool/Beach towels provided ... and even though they seem to have run out on day 1 the problem was rectified by day 2. Ample deck chairs available ... and what a pleasure not to have to reserve or wrestle guests for space.Beach clean and ... well, beautiful! Located within a small cove, it feels private and intimate yet expansive enough for a morning jog or walk.Hotel offers several restaurant options. We tried the Burger joint (Pergula) as a take away in our room ... on our balcony ... overlooking the sea. Recommendation - Bacalhau Burger - big yum!The main hotel restaurant serves a buffet every evening. Lovely atmosphere and wide variety of food options. But personally at Eur 35 per head, I'd rather eat down at the Atlantico Restaurant / Bar overlooking the beach. Simple food; decent quality; good prices ... and chilled live music after 5pm.Breakfasts were fab! A smorgasbord to suit almost any morning preference. PS: Coffee outstanding - thank you Nespresso!""Realito"" kids club a great option (and the staff is full of youthful energy). Small negatives - housekeeping inconsistent and slow. We never knew when the room would be serviced - day 1 - 11am, day 2 - 4pm, etc ... and perhaps the odd smile and greeting? The only staff members who didn't. The gym and spa lovely, but the equipment getting old and requiring some maintenance.This is the perfect place for a family with kids. Romantic couples be warned - my child might fling a french fry into your Aperol!"
Jul 2019,50,The perfect family vacation,"We had the perfect family holiday,My wife and I managed to relax while our 16 month old had a blast running around and playing, the hotel facilities are great, the proximity to the beach, the pools, the restaurants and bars, everything was simply good, the studio we stayed in was also well equipped and the food at the Santa Eulalia and atlantico was great. We will definitely be back"
Jul 2019,10,Greedy,"We checked in for two nights, we were working in the area. After one night we were called away by our office. Reception said we would still have to pay for the second night. At over 200 Euros a night we felt this was excessive greed."
Jul 2019,50,First trip to Portugal,"Absolutely fantastic time here, great location lovely hotel, nice spacious rooms.Probably the best kids club I’ve ever seen with friendly staff and great activities open until 10 pm which gave us a couple of hours an evening of grown up time which was perfect."
Jul 2019,30,It was a nice trip,Not a real 5 Stars hotel. Food should be better. A lot of guest don't known thats Children should Not Run the whole time through dishes. Rooms are  realy Good and  employes do a Good job. But a hotel should give advices to guests if they don't behave
Jul 2019,50,Perfect hotel in the most perfect spot - would go there anytime again!,"Nice hotel with an incredible seaview and only a short walk away from the marvellous beach. The main pools are often crowded, but there's the side pools as well. Variety of restaurants available and a good snack bar for lighter meals. In our case, the app. was spacious enough for our family of 4, cleaned daily and the towels are changed on a daily basis. Not to forget the wonderful Kids Club, our boys loved it and the team there."
Jul 2019,50,Great hotel,"Myself and my husband and our daughter stayed here for 4 nights recently. The hotel is beautiful set in its own gated complex. We had a room with a big balcony & sea view and the views day and night were just beautiful. The room itself was plenty big enough but could do with a little overhaul, nothing major just little things you wouldn't expect to see in a 5 star hotel.  The pools are perfect size and temperature. We had the buffet breakfast every morning and it was perfect, plenty to choose from. We ate in the fish restaurant 1 night and it was lovely, staff v friendly. We ate in the buffet restaurant on the last night & we didn't think it was great & a bit pricey. Its a 5 star hotel so you pay 5 star prices for everything even down to a glass of wine, €6 by the pool. Overall we had a lovely stay in a beautiful hotel with stunning views."
Jul 2019,20,Disappointing 5* promise.,"We chose the hotel for its proximity to the beach.  Unfortunately the hotel is not really a 5* it requires a proper renovation, cracks on the walls, room decor, amenities. We had asked for a room with a view, 1st room we had a large tree in front of the room. After discussing with front desk they found us a second room with promise of another room on the second floor.  Next day we saw the second floor room and decided its best to stay where we were. Staff at the hotel in general are kind, smiling and very helpful.  Room service tax is incredibly expensive at 5 euros a run. Kids club staff very kind but games needing to be renewed and activities need to be made a little more entertaining.  We had breakfast which after the 2nd day we were bored. Lots of it but not different enough. Overall very little value for money."
Jul 2019,30,Here at the moment,"This is about my 12th visit to this hotel. Sadly, this is not the 5* it was. I’ll list my gripes in no particular orderFirst room smelled of sewer so we were moved. Why put guests in the apartment Towels are shocking. Thrown better away. We have mostly used the pool at the apartments and the pool area has never been cleaned. Dirty sticky tables. Only today has the bar been opened and there are no ice creams Dirty ashtrays left on tables by the bar and it’s only just opened today! NO pans in the apartment if you wanted to cook anything Only 2 chairs on the patio. Glass has been left outside apartment 411 since we have been here. Until today we have had no waiter service around the pool. This is the height of the season and every thing should be spot on. Painfully slow service in the lobby bar in the evening. Hopefully things will get improve as the week goes on."
Jul 2019,30,Not a 5 star resort,"The plus was the private beach of the resort even though I left with a big pincushion on my leg and after returning to my country I treat it local and with oral antibiotics. I do not know what bite me, but it certainly happened in the water of the ocean or on the beach. The beach umbrellas were so small...and of course you had to pay for it.It was also a plus, the breakfast, which was very varied (eggs prepared in 4 ways, many fruits and pastries, sausages, cheese, and a fresh orange juice). The minus were: the unprepared staff at the reception, the apartment (458) had old furniture and the closet in the bedroom smelled bad and nothing could be stored there. On the other hand, daily and thorough cleaning was done. The kitchen was fully equipped and it would have been note 10 if there was a dishwashing detergent and also a paper towel roll (we bought  and left them there to help other customers).Another plus was the free shuttle to Albufeira, old city and beach.Per total, it is not a 5 star resort."
Jul 2019,40,Nice relaxing hotel close to the beach.,"a really nice hotel, close to a lovely beach. Food expensive in the hotel and drinks. £4.50 a small beer cocktails £8 a sandwich £8 but everything else was fine. Cheaper restaurants to eat directly outside hotel and off to the left."
Jul 2019,30,More style than substance,"We were allocated a one bedroom apartment in this hotel after Jet2 Holidays overbooked our original hotel. Apartment 529 was clean, spacious and overall, very comfortable. The maid every day kept the place immaculate.There was a degree of noise until the early hours from the adjacent hotel but there's not a lot the hotel can do about that. We were on half board so we had to eat breakfast and dinner in the main restaurant most nights. This is chaotic to say the least!The buffet style layout is concentrated in one corner of the restaurant. The area is far too small for the amount of people using it. Particularly when people have to carry hot coffee etc through the throng of people all clamouring for their breakfast!There were children running everywhere on our first couple of nights and one child was even riding a bicycle! Certainly didn't make for a relaxing evening meal!When we complained to management about the potential danger this was causing, we were told that "" it was the children's holiday as well"" and there was nothing they could do! Keep in mind that this is supposed to be a 5 STAR HOTEL!The food in the restaurant seemed to be varied enough but it was very rarely ever hot. In fact, I think there was only 1 night when I'd say it was acceptable. I did ask to speak to a manager about this after yet another cold dinner but I was told that they had left for the evening. The promise of a call the next day was obviously also forgotten! They also serve dinner outside 3 nights a week. This certainly didn't help regarding the temperature of the food and in some cases, it was so dark outside that it was impossible to read the minute cards that were set beside each dish to explain what they were. Incredibly frustrating!Also, the entire dessert area was completely uncovered. Not ideal when you have bats, seagulls and various insects flying overhead as it came up to sunset! We did try the burger restaurant one evening in the hope of a hot meal. I have to say that the food was actually excellent but the service was nonexistent!The hotel is situated on a stunning beach which is available or use to the guests of the hotel and the general public. We used this on several occasions and it never got so busy that it was uncomfortable. Overall, this hotel has so much potential but the restaurant facilities, standard of service and particularly the ongoing food temperature issues really need some work to get them up to 5 star standard."
Jul 2019,30,Holiday,We have been to this hotel about 8 times but feel this year the hotel seemed to be cutting corners the bars near the pools were not open and it looked as though you do with spending some money  cleaning up we do love the quietness of the second pool but feel the area was not as clean as it used to be you also don’t have any loyalty for customers who return and the last bus at 6.30 is too early what happened the one after 7 you finally get a bigger bus but nobody on it Not really 5 star
Jul 2019,40,Holiday at the Grande,"This place is an amazing hotel with excellent staff. We returned home to England today and bring with us some great memories. First of all, the hotel is really beautiful and is next to an idyllic beach setting. The staff are really kind ""Sampatico/ca'. They helped me learn some Portuguese during our staff. Ana Rita, Rafaela, Mariana, Georji, Anesh and Rubin were all amazing!!! A credit to the Portuguese people. The rooms were nice and tidy but it was the people who made this holiday special.ThanksTo you allDarren"
Jul 2019,50,Wonderful vacation,Absolutely beautiful resort. Pictures do not do it justice. Very friendly staff. Apartments are great for a family especially with two bathrooms. The breakfast buffet was excellent and their burger restaurant was great too.
Jul 2019,50,Location. Location. Location!,We were here last September and decided to revisit. Special location. Fantastic staff. So friendly. Shout out to Mario who always came over to us at breakfast and made us feel so welcome. A minutes walk to beautiful beach. Atlantico Restaurant great for brunch / lunch. Falésia pool bar. Great service. Friendly staff. Fantastic sea view room. Booked to come back again this September and can’t wait. Their birthday treat was so special. Muito obrigado.
Jul 2019,10,2 Star Hotel,"Beautiful venue hotel and resort. Poor management and service, except for the bar and resturaunt staff they were on form this time. This is my second visit to this resort. In 2017 i had a horrible experience and was given a free stay, i figured since they have had 2 years to improve it would be different but its not. Got woken up to construction underneath my suite this morning."
Jul 2019,20,Not Grande,"Just arrived but I will pass comment. I have been coming to Albufeira now for 12 years and often called in past this hotel since it has a nice bar and restaurant at beach. I’ve never had more than brunch but excellent. Stayed in the apartments around ten years ago and it was a bit jaded but I have always admired the hotel, it’s entrance, ambience so promising. Sold our property and a chance available to have three days at the main hotel, sea view room bed and breakfast. We must have the first sea view room and looks over the car park to the sea, no big issue, introductory blurb offered us a free upgrade if available, surprise surprise not available. Room very disappointing, no way five star, poor value for money, musty smell, and kettle will have to be on the floor to plug - in  I hope it gets betterVery disappointed"
Jul 2019,40,Excellent service but not 5 star accommodation,"We stayed in a one bedroom apartment which, although spacious and well equipped, was not five star - equivalent to 2-3 star apartments in other countries.  What made the hotel stand out was the level of service.   The staff were lovely and helpful and the hotel itself was immaculate. Our children loved the kids club in the morning and afternoons by the pool.  We ate at various restaurants in the hotel three times and the food was very good.  Drinks are overpriced and the ATM in the hotel lobby is a rip off.  The nearby beach is a lovely change from the small hotel pools."
Jul 2019,10,BAD ALL INCLUSIVE!,"good evening,we arrived on 2/7 we arrived for our honeymoon trip that our agency had specified in the booking (I read the email). to be honest, having traveled a lot, we found ourselves very badly.on our arrival (at two o'clock in the morning due to the scandalous TAP flight policy), the tour operator (king holiday) had asked us to at least find us a cold dinner. also because we were with two children. anything. we had to order two cheap sandwiches with chips (in an envelope) paid € 35, although we had not even used the half-board voucher. poor food for lunch and dinner, not from an international 5-star hotel for sure! your waiters even once did not want us to sit at the table because having bought a bottle of water in the box 5 minutes before we didn't have to buy it .... I had to yell in English with the head maid to tell her to let me talk to the manager . in life I deal with marketing and hotel reviews. I will translate your worst review in all languages. a hotel aimed only at gain (€ 3.50 per 75 ml of water). € 3 two coffees ... if we asked a question or spoke in English or were told: ""I don't understand"". this is the phrase of everyone, from the reception, to the spa, to the waiters, bar always closed in the Piacina adjacent to our apartment (503), always, even in the morning.not even a bottle of sparkling wine in the room to wish us a good honeymoon ... we in Italy are so used to it, we have been everywhere, I have traveled 47 countries for work, I did not expect a 5-star international in Algarve a reception, situations and such poor attitudes. I highly recommend changing jobs. read the other reviews because they are not good at all and I will translate this in all languages. ps if you charge us for 4 people, the towels in the room must be 4, both from the face, from the shower, and from the bidet. but I understand that cleanliness does not belong to you."
Jul 2019,40,"Great Beach, close to town, super clean,family friendly.","My family spent 4 nights here and enjoyed the pools and beach.  We stayed in for!an apartment with our 3 kids (one infant included) and it was baby friendly as bit of a hike.The place is super clean, easy beach access and staff were very helpful. We actually needed a doctor for my son who developed a bad ear ache and the front desk arranged for a doctor to visit our apartment lwithin 1 hour of calling them!  Amazing! We had a car and parking was a breeze.  Albufeira old town was a 7 minute drive away - we parked in a parking garage in Estacionamento 5 which is a perfect location for parking when visiting especially at night.  Lots of night life - family friendly!   1 euro per hour.I’d give the resort 5 stars if it weren’t so expensive...I found it overpriced for what you get especially the meals/restaurants ($20 euro per person for breakfast)  The beach is a bit of a hike from the apartments - fine for adults but too far for 3 small kids to walk. I’d definitely stay again but would ask to stay closer to the beach and plan better around meals.Overall a great experience!"
Jul 2019,20,Overrated,"firstly i received a email upon my return to participate in a survey from the hotel about its service so happily completed it and they posted it on trip advisor which i have deleted as i was mislead.firstly this is not a 5* star resort , it needs attention and money spending on it to bring it back to a level i’m sure its been in the past and staff need to learn what customer service is !! , not all as When we arrived Jorge who took our cases to the room was always smiling and spoke every time we saw him he could learn others .room was large and spacious although in need of an update , kettle in room but had to stand it on the floor when i use as no sockets near were it’s located , telephone in room didn’t work and took 3days and for me to take it to reception to get someone to fix it , again not the service we expected .breakfast was ok with plenty of choice .drinks and snacks during day expensive around the pool entertainment staff during the day just seem to take over the pool area for hours on end to place an aqua ball which people get in and then it’s inflated to walk on water which is charged for , obviously pool not used whilst this is going on then followed by aqua fit with clueless staff in charge, this is most days.entertainment on an evening is poor so not much going on in such a large hotel which is missing as not much around hotel and would be welcomed.Atlantic restaurant overlooks the beach and is also open to public from beach , staff are rude and we were asked to move tables as we were on a large table and only two of us but no alternative table offered even tho we were hotel guests and it’s part of the hotel !! also steps from here to beach are in a poor state of repair and dangerous .overpriced drinks and food within the hotel and it lets itself down , paying for 5* but not getting the service nor the hotel .overall grounds kept well but need a refurbishment and customer training , i did speak to reception staff a few times however the understanding of english is poor ( better then my language skills tho ) but it should be better .hopefully i won’t see a standard response from hotel about this review as i did mention some of this whilst i was there and nothing was done or said so i don’t want patronising now ."
Jul 2019,40,Great Holiday,"We had a great stay at the hotel, which is in a great location. The restaurants are nice and there are many things to do and places to eat, outside of, but close to, the hotel complex. The beach is extremely close to hotel with cafes and resturants over looking it."
Jul 2019,50,Amazing Resort,I would definitely come back. The resort is amazing. Several activities. Well located. Amazing staff. Room very clean. Good amenities. Studio with kitchen was great. Was able to cook breakfast in the room.
Jul 2019,50,First time in Portugal. Excellent hotel look forward too returning in the future,"My partner and I arrived here on the 2nd of July and it did not disappoint. A little bit of paradise. As we stepped out of our coach we were met by staff who gave us a lovely warm welcome and took our luggage for us. Check in was quick and we were gave a welcome package with information about the hotel facilities,the shuttle bus times into the new and old town,and things we could do around Portugal. Our room was very nice,clean,very large comfortable bed,and had all the facilities we would need throughout our stay. The pool area was great,lots of beds. Pool was very cold tho so we didnt use it much. Views were amazing from all around the hotel. Bars all very good. Large beer £3 cocktails £6. We were breakfast only and couldn't fault it. Access to the beach and the beach itself were fantastic. Plenty of watersports etc. We did the jetskiings and really enjoyed it. Photos from it are so good. We loved the little beach bar. The views from it was stunning. Spa was excellent. I had a massage,the best I've ever had then I had a wash and blowdry before heading out that night. Taxis always sitting outside the hotel. Few euro into the town. 5 mins away (new town) old town about 10 minutes away. We had to leave at 7am on our last day for the airport,the hotel organised room service for us to have our breakfast which was so lovely. We were very sad to leave and will definitely be back again in the future as will lots of our family and friends after seeing our photographs and hearing us rave about it. Thank you grande real santa eulalia"
Jul 2019,40,Good 5* hotel,"- kids club: fantastic, open 12hours a days, excellent shows, kindhearted young people, probably the best I have ever seen, absolutely recommend. just fitness lessons are happening in cold swimming pool, might be in a warmer- room: very clean, fantastic everyday service, I would say 4* impression of the room, wifi and TV working very well, just a but stinky outside 541 apartment and noisy bin collection lorries around midnight from next door hotel every day !- breakfast: very good english breakfast, just sausages are not high quality-you should really change it, lack of vegetables but on the other hand really a lot of fruit, 3 coffe machines which is fantastic, but try to pay just a few more euros for slightly higher quality coffee bins, lack of filtered coffee that is more suitable for breakfast especially in 5*, big variety of juices but some of them are not 100% fruit or if they are they dont taste the best but not worst - its worth to spend few more money on it -lunch: the best meal in this hotel: FANTASTIC !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no problem at all, BBQ-dinner: very good variety, some of the meals are super high quality, some low quality, depends on the day, sometimes a lot of dishes with seafood - be careful if you are alergic. large beer 4.5euro, apple juice 3euro, bottle of wine 20euro, staf polite and prompt-acces to the beach fantastic-very good gym- free parking - enough spaces- extremenly helpful polite staff - thank you !!!- towels pool service is great-heated main pool - 25 degrees, i think number of seats is so so..almoust ok :-)- burger restaurant very goood, the hotel i think should improve in deserts - not bad but not 5star hotel deserts (maybe im spoiled :-)  - seafood restaurant: havent tried because we wanted to try our last day but it was closed, still have 2 spare vouchers :-)- on 5* hotel beach you have to pay for seats and umbrella (10 euro) - it doest seems like good advertisiment  - sorry guys - its not just question of moneyconclusion: very good hotel, i would say regarding fantastic kids club, hotel souroundings and location, and overall impresion its 5 star hotel, variety of food is 5 star as well but quality of some ingredients and taste of some prepared meals is 4 star. we paid 2450 euro for one week as ""family program""....I would say real cost  would be around 2000-2100 euro. I think I might recomment this hotel and if i get some mild discount we might be thinking about coming back next year."
Jul 2019,20,Not even a 4 star hotel if not that well located,"It’s been 6 years now that I am coming each summer to grande real santa Eulália, mainly because of the hotel good amenities for children. Nevertheless, I am obliged to say it will be my last venue as this hotel is very poorly managed (as many unfortunately) and better deserves a 3 star rating than a 5, i can guarantee anyone. No or very few refurbishment, basic amenities ( outdoor toilets) not functioning,young summer employees not trained at all, hotel management responsibles are invisible and not reachable, kids clubs basic and not well organized.Poor quality food at restaurant, the list could be longer.If you are expecting a minimum basic service of a normal 4 star hotel ( the hotel is supposed to be a 5 star’s one) , dont come. You will be hugely disappointed.Big issue with hotel management and price/ quality positioning Stay of July 2019"
Jul 2019,50,Great stay,"Lovely stay, great staff, clean rooms, good WiFi connectionSeafood and beach restaurant next to it were delicious.Nice pool areas - preferred the quieter ones than the main one.Would recommend to anyone!"
Jul 2019,30,"Great grounds and amazing staff, but awfull old rooms with ants and very poor WiFi","The grounds are beautiful. Staff were friendly and welcoming.WiFi - non existent, poor and disconnected every 10-20 minutes.Room facilities - very little kitchen, old furniture and decor, room even smelled old. Room also had ants running everywhere - on table, kitchen top etc. Awful experience."
Jul 2019,50,Excellent quality service and ambience,2nd time we have stayed here and on both occasions outstanding!!! We stayed in apartment this time with our kids and equally as good as the hotel... only 1 min walk to lobby... also excellent Italian across road from main entrance which does takeaways handy for relaxing on terrace!!
Jul 2019,40,Five star location but not five star hotel. The property is beautiful however some rooms need to be updated.,Love the location but hotel could use some updating. Service is great but some information they gave me was incorrect. Restaurant by pool needs more variety and fish restaurant was too expensive. We keep coming back mostly due to the location right on the beach!
Jul 2019,50,relaxing beach vacation,I've been to many beaches. The one near this hotel was perfect. The hotel caters to families. It's ok for a friends trip but not for couples. I stayed in an apartment which was further from the beach but still walking distance. Housekeeping cleaned our dishes. Restaurant food was delicious.
Jul 2019,50,fantastic hotel we were well looked after,"Apartment had everything and was cleaned daily, the reception staff spoke good English and went out of their way to help us book trips sort transport etc,They have staff to take you and your luggage to your rooms and bring you irons etc.only complaint no supermarket or basic for sale at hotel like milk and bread and indoor pool was extra ."
Jul 2019,50,Well worth a stay,"We stayed in an apartment for 10 nights and couldn’t have faulted the cleanliness and general maintenance and upkeep of the resort. There’s nice restaurants and a bar with several pools dotted around. The hotel leads onto a beach which is beautiful and not overcrowded. All staff were extremely helpful and professional and our apartment was cleaned daily. There’s a free bus shuttle into the old and new town until approximately 18.30 each day, but after this time we got a taxi a few times which was around €8. Although we are a mature couple, we could certainly see the attraction for families to the resort. Definitely recommend a stay."
Jul 2019,40,Family holiday.,Dont get me wrong the hotel is absoutle  beautiful but is in a poor location for families.  It's to expensive to eat in so each night took a 20 minute walk into the strip or a 10 euro taxi into the old town which adds up when your with a family. The pool area near out apartments but the snack bar wasnt open once so it also ment packing up at the pool and more walking involed. The rooms are spotless the maids do an outstanding job infact to good of a job glad I've tried this hotel but would not stay again
Jul 2019,50,Great Location and wonderful views,The staff are amazing so friendly. Nice quiet resort on a lovely beach. Quite a lot of steps so not for the less mobile. Not many shops for everyday needs but Albufeira not too far away by bus or taxi.
Jul 2019,50,5 Star Hotel,Real Santa Eulalia is a great resort for family vacation at the algarve.Very close to the Beachand very good service and welcoming and friendly atmosphere.Appreciated very much the diverse swimmingpools.
Jul 2019,40,Five star ??,"Ive been to this hotel twice now. I loved it the first time and would have given it five stars. I went again last year and feel its dropped off the Five star rating.  It just needed some attention to detail in some areas.I also had a issue with what i totally believe was a theft in our room, it was handled with no resolve in my opinion.I will give the breakfast five stars as it’s wonderful, everything was lovely, fresh omelettes made to order each morning, everything replenished and no waiting for anything.They could do with more bed outside in the pool area, word to the wise....don’t leave you bed for too long as people are very cheeky last year and pinched mine whilst I was at first aid with my son!! Have to say the first aid was superb at the hotel. Hotel does have a good feel about it, its very clean, friendly staff.  Have a shuttle bus into the Old Town every evening. Hotel has a beautiful setting, restaurant below on way beach  is great too."
Jul 2019,20,Not even close to a 5* hotel,"The grounds are beautiful and hotel is very close to the beach. Staff are friendly and helpful.The rooms are awful - we are staying in a 1 bed apartment which is full of ants, with very tired decor and old towels/bath robes, broken kettle and the room does not even have tea/coffee. Overall the accommodation is 3* at best and we won't be staying here again.Restaurant prices are however truly 5* with 32 euro per person for a buffet dinner. You can have great 3 course dinner with sangria/beer for less money in the nearby authentic Portuguese restaurants instead."
Jul 2019,50,Great stay,"Had a great time at this 5 star resort . Great food , service and an excellent beach . The staff was very helpfull with a great buffet breakfast  .courteous staff . good outdoor sitout .. Would surely comeback"
Jun 2019,30,Good Hotel but room for improvement in places,"First thing to point out is that we had a great stay at this hotel. I would stay here again but there are a few things that are worth pointing out. I have split my overall comments into “Pros” and “Cons” to make it easy to read. ProsReally friendly staff.Good kids clubs (with amazing staff).Spacious rooms (we had a suite room in the hotel which was excellent for families).Comfortable beds.Very good breakfast buffet.Nice outdoor pool areas (see cons).Situated on a beautiful beach (hire of sunbeds were separate from hotel).Lovely indoor pool area with sauna and steam room (see cons).Nice spacious lobby area with bar.Good value for a “5 star” hotel (but I would suggest it was a solid 4 star instead).Adjacent restaurants (out with the hotel) were decent. ConsIt doesn’t “feel” like a 5 star hotel compared to others which isn’t necessarily an issue as it is relatively cheaper.Overall the place is beginning to look a bit “tired” – i.e. external walls needing plastered, letters and numbers for floors and rooms are missing, internal decoration also needing freshened up.The place felt like it was coming to the end of a refurbishment cycle and needed the next one within the next 12 to 24 months.Never saw the outdoor pool area being cleaned as thoroughly they do in other resorts – i.e. some sun loungers sometimes had the odd seagull dropping on them in the morning, the grills around the pool perimeters weren’t as clean as other pools. Decking areas around pools probably need replaced as they are beginning to get worn out.General upkeep and maintenance is not as good as other 4 and 5 star hotels I have stayed in.Larger pools were too cold when we visited.The indoor Spa area is lovely but access and pricing is all over the place. For example the sauna & steam room are 10 euros for an hour, with the use of the indoor pool an additional 20 per hour, and none of these are free with a spa treatment?????They insist on wearing swimming caps in the pool which is actually quite annoying (is this the 1980s?).This is worth comparing to the Crowne Plaza in Vilamoura - they charge guests 10 euros for the day to access indoor pools, sauna and steam room which are even better than this one.The indoor pools at this hotel were pretty dead and underused, presumably as a result of the pricing, which is a shame.Charging for access is relatively normal in Europe but the pricing structure was a bit annoying as it was a blatant rip off for a place marketing itself as a “Spa”.This actually really annoyed me as I would have used the indoor pool every day had there been no (or a nominal charge).The bars and restaurants were puzzling as they didn’t seem to be very busy despite occupying some lovely spots in the resorts with some amazing views. Maybe the pricing and the menus didn’t excite people to use them?It doesn’t appear that the “Gourmet Burger” restaurant was well used. The “fancy” place with the ocean views was expensive and not for kids.We used the Atlantico café bar twice but the food was poor It was 9 euros for what appeared to look like a frozen pizza. This was shame as it also has great views across the beach.The lunch and dinner buffets in the main restaurant both looked decent but at 25 and 35 I felt they were a bit expensive compared to the external competition.We found there tended to be an exodus of families around 7pm to the adjacent restaurants which were really good and had much better food for kids.Pool bar prices were reasonably high for food and drink. Sandwiches were pretty poor. Beer expensive compared to surrounding areas.We couldn’t get a decent coffee at breakfast (i.e. instant type coffee out a machine).   Please note that despite the “cons” I would stay here again at some point but it definitely needs refurbishment in the short to medium term."
Jun 2019,50,COUPLE HOLIDAY,"Excellent hotel, facilities with supportive staff . Tips: Free bus ride from hotel to new /old town centre. Some of the tour do pick up from hotel. One beach  restaurant  down, is reasonable food but always busy. Beach bed charges apply 5 euro as of June 2019."
Jun 2019,30,Ok but no more ,Clean and tidy small rooms expensive for food and drinks and €20 to use the indoor pool was a joke nothing really bad to say but I constantly felt that the sole purpose of the hotel was to make money (which it is but the guests should not feel like this)Outdoor terrace nice and position re beach excellentBreakfast nice (hot food often cold though)Pity that outdoor terrace used for weddings not available to guests when not in useI apologise for being slightly picky but hotels get 5 stars for a reason and I felt that in this case the 5 stars were inappropriate
Jun 2019,50,Relaxing holiday,"Excellent hotel.  Courteous efficient, helpful and friendly staff.  Amazing cuisine at breakfast and dinner with a wide variety of dishes, all beautifully prepared and presented.Rooms are very comfortable.  Plenty of wardrobe and cupboard space.  Also a refreshment tray with kettle.Beautiful location.  Pretty, well looked after gardens.  Some of the steps need attention - a few broken and hazardous.  Pool area is very clean and well maintained.  Sunbeds are plentiful, although a little hard.  Pool towels are provided for guests.Overall my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely revisit.  When we had a little problem with our room not being attended to, the matter was addressed immediately.The free shuttle bus service to Albufeira is frequent and efficient.A very relaxing holiday!"
Jun 2019,50,Fantastic resort,"We recently stayed in Grande Real Santa Eulalia resort and all I can say is WOW, from the moment we arrived everything was amazing. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment, the facilities were brilliant. We had a 6 month old baby with us and the hotel provided a travel cot with a matress which was comfortable. The apartment was cleaned daily. The hotel facilities were fantastic from the pools to the bar and restaurants.we used the spa facilities and had a treatment which was very relaxing. It was also my birthday during our stay and the hotel surprised me by sending champagne and a birthday cake to my room such a thoughtful and kind gesture. There is also an italian restaurant and martins restaurant just outside the resort which are both lovely. The shuttle bus runs regularly into both old town and new town. The beach is beautiful with a lovely bar to have a quiet drink.We will definitely return and I would highly recommend the resort to everyone."
Jun 2019,50,Great stay and great views,Amazing views from breakfast. I would recommend the burger restaurant! Great  placfood.Fantastic place to stay. We loved that the hotel put on a free bus that gets you from the hotel to the old town. 5 star.
Jun 2019,40,Hotel & beach beautiful,"Breakfast lovely, over all very clean, shuttle bus very handy, Room was small, golf buggy noisy at night, if staying near reception. Kids club friendly, baby pool great, plenty shade for babys at pool, Would return, stayed for 1 week."
Jun 2019,50,Bed & Breakfast,"I can’t fault the hotel, the staff were friendly and very helpful. The breakfast was lovely. We had a resort view room which looked over the front entrance of the hotel. The pools over look the beach. It never felt crowded there was always sun beds free. You can get a clean towel everyday. The rooms were spacious. The hotel is in a great location for restaurants lots of choice in both directions out of the hotel. The strip is in walking distance and we also walked to the old town one day. Our restaurant favourites were aroma di mare, the clay oven and Thai Phuket. The gym was well equipped and air conditioned. There are 30minute fitness classes available too twice a day."
Jun 2019,50,Enjoyable,"I could spend ages writing different things about this hotel but instead I will give the most Important details. My 2 children and I had an amazing family holiday .staff great, location great , food great."
Jun 2019,50,Great Hotel ,"This is a great hotel, large complex with lovely bars and restaurants on site. The staff are very friendly and efficient. The hotel has wonderful sea views and has easy access to the beach. We ate in the seafood and burger restaurant and the food was well presented and was delicious. The cocktails were lovely and well priced at 8 euros. We were on a bed and breakfast basis and the breakfast was buffet style with a good selection of options. You good choose to eat inside or outside weather permitting. The hotel is approx 4 miles from the Old Town but the hotel offers a free shuttle bus. Although I have rated the hotel 5/5 there were some aspects that could have been improved to fully justify the 5 star rating but are very minor. The rooms although very traditional in style they are in need of updating. The drinks tray was not replenished daily and ours wasn’t full from the first day. Although you receive a complimentary bottle of water on the first day this wasn’t replaced which I would have expected. Our room was at the front overlooking the car park, I would choose a different room next time so we could sit out on the balcony and relax. But other than that the hotel was lovely and we would definitely return."
Jun 2019,50,Great hotel,Best hotel in the area in my opinion very worthy of its 5* rating only 1 criticism I would like the coffee sachets replaced every day not have to pay after first ones used when your paying upwards of £2000 for a week well ?? The water isn’t replaced either after the first bottle but not a problem as you can drink the tap water but overall fantastic hotel and location wouldn’t stay anywhere else
Jun 2019,50,Family Holiday,"The hotel was brilliant for families. The staff were welcoming and kind. The food, pools and room were perfect and the beach was clean and safe for young children. I can't recommend the hotel enough and the location was great."
Jun 2019,40,Big complex - ok place,"A bit outside the senter of Albufeira . Free buss to the center.We had a studio. Well equippet. The room was  Clean  and ok, but has not a 5 star standard.The staff was friendly and serviceminded. The first studio we got was dark and no sun on the terrass. Request for to change was met without question.It is s big complex, but have 3 different pool areals. So no problems with sunbeds.The beach is great with posibilities to walk along the shore and find a privat small beach.The restaurant offers s buffet. Thats one of the best we had. The only entertainment was live music in the bar.For us a nice stay without the woow factor."
Jun 2019,40,Good Hotel. Great Food. A little expensive,"I chose this hotel as it was located close to the beach. It was a 3 minute walk down a very accessible path. The reviews mentioned that the food was a high standard and they were correct. There was a reasonable variety in the buffet every night with thoughtful use of leftovers. I would have been happy to have each component of the buffet as a stand-alone meal. The Seaview room I was in was spacious. The bed was a bit firm but not uncomfortable. Wifi was strong throughout the hotel and even at the pool. My two negative comments are regarding the pool and the prices. The pool was just too cold. I went in June and it was 25C out but no one was in the pool as it was freezing. It seems a bit of a waste as it could be heated slightly to a comfortable temperature. The other things was the price of the drinks. If you ae on half board, you get a meal voucher to use in the main restaurant only. Soft drinks are not included. A simple soda was $3.50 and they refused to give me tap water even though there were jugs present at the breakfast buffet. The final comment is an observation that they did not have the policy like most hotels to only change towels that are on the floor. They changed my towels every day and also the towel heaters were set to be on as long as you were in the room. Not great for the environment. Maybe they could use that energy to heat the pool. All in all a nice hotel if a little expensive."
Jun 2019,50,Beautiful,"Stayed here for my honeymoon with new husband and our 3 year old son. We loved it. Staff were lovely and friendly. Plenty of pools to choose from. Lots of little things that were nice extras which we didn't see advertised. Little golf buggies to take you and luggage to rooms on checking in and just phoned reception to help us with our things when checking out, they came straight along with the buggy. Towels free from hotel reception for pool and beach and just give them back when finished using them for the day. Rooms cleaned daily. We wish we had booked 2 weeks instead of 1. Ate at the Atlantico bar a couple of times for lunch and it was lovely, plenty of staff so weren't waiting long to be served. Free shuttle bus from hotel to new and old town and returns too. Have already been looking at booking again we loved it so much and we only got back yesterday."
Jun 2019,50,Another fantastic stay,"6th time staying at this wonderful hotel. Can wait to make it a 7th. Everything is fantastic about this place, from the staff, to the scenery. My family and I can’t wait for our 2020 visit. If not sooner."
Jun 2019,50,Fantastic!,Great resort! Beautiful beach and pool. The room had a great view of the ocean. Room was clean and roomy. The resort has great restaurants and bars. I also went for a massage which was great! Perfect vacation resort.
Jun 2019,50,Beautiful Hotel in a stunning location,"We have just returned from a weeks stay in an apartment at this hotel. It was very well equipped, had cleaning service every day and was spacious. I have just read a review stating the baths were slippery, we just asked for a bath mat which was delivered very quickly. The staff were very friendly and could not do enough to help you. There are several pools and a beautiful beach. The grounds are immaculate. Everything is nearby, supermarkets and restaurants. We attended a beautiful wedding at the hotel which was perfect. The food and service were amazing. Such a stunning location. I would recommend this to anyone and will definitely be returning."
Jun 2019,50,Family trip,"Excellent staffClean, well appointed roomsGreat food and drink varietyExcellent resort, close to beach, has all manner of facilities, a little too far to walk anywhere else though. Although there is a shuttle."
Jun 2019,50,lovely hotel,"a lovely hotel, we had a classic room with a sea view. the staff were excellent. very clean. 2 things that were not ok , were no proper entertainment and the price of food and drink was too expensive."
Jun 2019,50,Relaxing,Beautiful relaxing holiday. Peaceful and quiet by the swimming pool near the appartments.  Excellent location next to a beautiful beach..free bus to old town and new town. Staff were very helpful. Highly recommend a stay here
Jun 2019,40,Came for my marriage anniversary,"People very kind, welcoming. They organised a surprise for us in the room. The hotel was very clean. The only let down was vegetarian food, the choice was terrible. Please get some veg options.....we really struggled, the ones you had very bad...other than veg food, you guys were very good. Bit pricy, i thought.."
Jun 2019,50,Apartments,"I wasn't impressed with the standard of the first apartments that I was given  it smelt damp, the plaster on the wall was coming off and the walls felt damp, there was dirty stains on the kitchen table there were ants crawling all over the kitchen work tops and the floor I was very disappointed as I was there for 7 days for a wedding  ,so I went to see the G M  who was very nice and he moved me to another apartment which was a lot cleaner and felt fresher I asked for another matress as  the one on the bed was that thin you could feel the spring and the metal bed frame which hurt my back but it was ok with the double matress I think I will stay in the hotel next time but hotel was absolutely gorgeous."
Jun 2019,50,Fantastic,"Although on the more expensive side of accommodation in Albufeira, it’s was definitely worth every penny . Really family friendly, staff are so lovely . The boys who help you with your luggage on the golf carts are brilliant . The household staff are fantastic, every day clean towels and clean your apartment. So many different pools to go too ,only a short walk to the beach . We didn’t use the kids club but piped in and out with our little ones . And they too were so nice .  Would definitely recommend this hotel ."
Jun 2019,50,"Great break,  superb hotel",We really enjoyed our week. The staff are brilliant and can't do enough to make sure you enjoy your stay. The location is beautiful and the amenities are excellent. Really enjoyed the variety o.f the food
Jun 2019,50,We had a brilliant time here. There were around 50 of us all together and everyone had the most amazing time.,"Beds are massive, we had a sea view suite which was plenty big enough for 4 of us. Breakfast was really good with plenty of  choice. The kids were in the pools all day. There was a small baby pool a medium pool which was perfect for mine and then a deep pool for adults. The pools were always spotless. Staff were brilliant. The beach is so easy to get to and again really clean.We had a great stay and would recommend"
Jun 2019,50,fabulous place to stay to truly relax,"fabulous location, staff so friendly and facilities excellent.  From the start of our trip to the end, all of our needs were taken care of .  Delighted to have access to pools and beach.  For a treat, this is the place to stay."
Jun 2019,30,The beach,"The location along the ocean was great. The employees were nice. The breakfast was varied and plentiful. The rooms were large but outdated. The hallway had a strong musty smell that never went away. The pool areas were nice, however the trashcans were overflowing and the deck was sticky"
Jun 2019,50,Excellent,Just returned from this great hotel as a party of over 50 for a wedding at another hotel. The rooms were big clean  and nicely decorated breakfast was everything you could want just one thing no water filter  in resturant  3 euros for a bottle of water  to much we took a jug of water from the cereal table baring in mind 9 of us were sat at table told we could not have it on table  drinks were reasonable for a lovely hotel  amazing views from main pool beach 5minutes away nice beach bar through gates to beach  overall we all had a lovely time even though were a lot of us all at once
Jun 2019,50,Great family holiday,"We just spent a week in the Grande Real and it was fabulous.  Our 1 bed apartment was spotless and really comfortable.  Our 5 year old loved the pools and the beach.  The staff were very friendly and welcoming.  The variety of food at breakfast was brilliant, something to suit everyone.  The resort restaurants were very expensive, no way you could eat there for the duration of the holiday.  The free shuttle bus into New Town/Old Town every day was great.  Our son didn't use the Kids Club as such but did play in the play area which was well staffed with very welcoming and fun young staff.  Zoomarine is definately worth a visit, the hotel organised a taxi for us there and back.  Will definately look at returning to Grande Real in the near future."
Jun 2019,30,Okay.,"Broke a rib slipping in the bath/shower first day. No non-slip mats, 'non-slip' appearance just painted on bath floor. Hotel management not helpful but eventually agreed to pay medical costs. Hotel restaurants expensive. The hotel is okay - a reasonable average - but nothing to write home about. Booked the hotel because of the rave Trip Advisor reviews. Not the first time the reality contradicts the reviews. First and last visit to Albufeira - all English breakfast cafes, Irish bars and all the charm of Clacton in the 60s."
Jun 2019,50,Outstanding ,Myself and my fiancé have been here almost 11 nights (last day tomorrow) I can’t rate this hotel enough. They staff are fantastic. Special thanks to the maids for cleaning our apartment every day. I just love the quirkinesses of the apartments. We were seconds away from the pool which was a big plus. The beach is beautiful right on the hotels door step. Will definitely be back. Only thing I will say to the quests is if you buy a float or ball for the pool make sure you take them away with you at night and someone will take them. Happened to a few of ours.
Jun 2019,40,Beware of Spa Theif,"Overall we had a good experience, the staff were friendly and helpful and catered for our dietary requirements.Unfortunately when we visited the spa (swimming pool sauna and steam room) there was a €20 charge and you have to buy a swimming hat for €3. After using the sauna my daughter and I we showered but my daughter's necklace was stolen from my bathrobe pocket. There was one man in spa pool, who was very tactical on reflection and had been watching our every move. When I reported the theft I was told that it could not be that man because he was a member and last year he had handed in a necklace. Unfortunately this was no comfort because I am 100% certain the necklace was carefully and purposefully placed in the bathrobe pocket as I saw this with my own eyes. So be mindful to lock away all valuables before using the sauna.The room was clean,but my swimming costume was taken with the towels when the room was cleaned (though it was alone on a separate hook), still reception staff helpfully ensured it was quickly returned to me. The beach is great too, and despite the above we generally enjoyed most of our stay."
Jun 2019,40,Beware - Light fingered SPA member,"The hotel was great, and the staff were very helpful. Unfortunately you have to pay €20 to use the indoor swimming and sauna / steam room and you must buy a swimming hat which costs €3 if you don't have one. Whilst we were in the pool a man stole my daughters necklace from my bathrobe pocket, (it wasn't lost because it was perfectly placed in my bathrobe pocket). On reflection the man had been watching us for some time and was very tactical. When I reported it staff said it could not be him because he's a member and handed in a necklace last year! So beware to lock away all valuables before using the sauna.Other than this and my swimming costume being taken with the towels by the maid's, the rest of our experience was lovely.The beach is great and the room was lovely and clean. Reception staff are very helpful and friendly."
Jun 2019,10,Unpleasant experience,"The most unfriendly, unaccomodating hotel that we have ever stayed at:  We have travelled all over the world and we can’t understand how it has a five star rating: the rooms are old and badly in need of renovation.  There is a coffee pot to make a cup of coffee but after the first day no more coffee or water is left when they clean the room. Not even toilet tissue is replaced daily. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone,  !"
Jun 2019,30,Suitable for Families but Not young travelers,"Well we have mixed feelings for this hotel. It is very convenient for families with Kids as they do have nice pool area and kids club and private beach which makes it more convenient for families. However, it was too noisy for us at night when kids were playing at the lobby during the night. The rooms were okay. they were spacious but the mattresses were stiff and not comfortable at all. We booked for garden view and it is actually the parking lot view. When we complained about the beds, they receptionist was kind enough to upgrade us to a bigger room with nice terrace and REAL garden view which they actually call a Seaview but you can barely have seaview from the trees. The breakfast has good variety but it misses the vegetables. There were only tomatoes!However, the staff were super friendly and helpful. Many thanks and huge admiration to Mr. Cruz who managed to help us book for one of the best boat tours along the caves in the region. He made sure to do his best to fullfil our requirement without any reminders. He was really of great help. I am glad i met such a person who seemed so passionate about his job and willing to help people effortlessly.Another good thing is that the hotel has free shuttles to old and new towns which made it easier for us to tour around."
Jun 2019,50,Lovely family holiday - we will return!,"We’ve just got back from a week holiday with our 2 and 4 year old children and had a fantastic time! The hotel catered for all of our needs with a young family - children friendly pools, a beach connected to the resort, fantastic children’s club and great food. We will be returning next year!!"
Jun 2019,50,Absolutely amazing,"This place is amazing. From the room views to the staff friendliness and clean rooms. The breakfast is very good, lots of choices and good food.Everyone at the kids club were absolutely amazing. Always friendly and happy to play with the kids. My daughter loved it.It was our daughter birthday and we were surprised with a cake and a nice card so much appreciated. We will defo come back"
Jun 2019,30,wedding guest,came for our grandsons wedding with my family we booked last year and we were put all over the hotel the  views from our windows were awful rooms were very dull lighting was terrible no high sockets had to boil the kettle on the floor the staff were very miserable had to buy your milk if you wanted to have a drink in the room every single hotel i have stayed in all over the world 3 to 5 stars you got 2 of tea coffee sugar spoon milk and  cream skimpping on everything even to not putting a bag in your bin ridiculous none of my family would never go there again the was cold you have one toaster at breakfast you have to wait 5 minutes and more for them to bring more bread the chess and ham omelettes were awful you could not taste the cheese about 5 little bits of ham it was discusting really all the food is garlic herbs no english food as such and I suffer with my stomach all your foods I could not eat at dinner the only one nice guy the manager had me some  plain chicken and chips made  3 nights running he was very pleasent.
Jun 2019,40,Lovely stay,"Just back from a lovely short break.  This is a really nice hotel offering beautiful views in a calm relaxing environment.  Ideal for couples.  The rooms are a great size, yes the carpet needs updating and it needs a refresh in parts but the overall look and feel of the hotel is superb, staff are lovely too. A very enjoyable stay."
Jun 2019,50,Perfect,"Perfect stay, everything about the hotel was amazing. Friendly staff. Always attentive. The proximity to the beach is amazing and location in general is good. Loved the restaurant/cafe on the way to the beach."
Jun 2019,50,Fantastic location,"The hotel staff are fantastic. The cleanliness of the hotel and apartments is exemplary. It is a bit dated for a 5 star but a very enjoyable experience. I would recommend that the kids club be relocated as it is a bit out of the way, but all in all a fantastic time had by all the family"
Jun 2019,40,Lovely stay,The beach being steps away was the highlight of our stay along with the hospitality of the hotel reception team. The rooms and hotel are nicely decorated. Breakfast was sufficient and quality was good although a wider variety would have helped.Sleep was ok but mattresses were too stiff for us and at the point of mentioning discomfort the hotel staff quickly moved us to a nicer room. The mattresses are just chosen that way.Shuttle services were perfect to be staying out of the hustle and bustle yet minutes away for free when you wanted to go.The hotel is popular with families as they host numerous stuff for kids but it’s also a nice place to stay if you want to disconnect and relax by the beach. Only surprise sun-beds belonged to a rental and not the hotel but you could still use your towel to enjoy the beach.Overall a lovely stay that was perfected due to a dedicated and friendly staff which sometimes beats it all. Big shout out to J. Cruiz for his amazing recommendations and help booking our activities.Thank you!
Jun 2019,50,Great stay again!,"Just back from another great stay in grse.  Could do with apartments upgrade & poolside not as clean as it used to be at apartments side. Hotel area definitely 5star,  however apartments don't meet 5 star quality in my book!"
Jun 2019,10,MORE 18 30'S THAN 5 STAR RELAXING HOTEL,"It turns out this hotel is used by The Priory! Yes, that Priory! The Priory is an “upmarket clinic” where people who struggle with addiction are helped. (according to the internet previous guests include Kate Moss, Pete Doherty, Robbie Williams etc etc).Consequently over 100 ""guests"" arrived and took over the place, quite literally. Openly discussing The Priory, their liver transplants and how long they had been dry or off drugs! (Although dry and off drugs was certainly not evident; people clearly intoxicated all day and a strong smell of Marijuana around the pool areas) Openly advertising their ""meetings"" (held on the hotel premises) with flyers around areas of the hotel! Blasting music around the pool, screaming abusive language and ignoring any request from Hotel security to tone it down.When we complained to the manager he took no responsibility for the bookings at his ""family hotel"" and went on to tell us there was nothing he could do as they were paying guests. Despite our (and several other complaints we were aware of) nothing was done. We were informed by a regular visitor to this hotel who had also complained, that there is an ""affinity"" between the owner of Real group of hotels and The Priory hence the presence of these people!There was no respite for the children as the only children's pool was closed for repairs throughout our 10 night stay, therefore unless you are happy to expose your children to these behaviors you have no choice but to leave the area. This is clearly collusion between the Hotel and the operators including Jet 2 with whom we booked. The reps at this Hotel are obliged to report any issues to the company they represent and pass this on to their customers which include any disruption. No wonder they keep this disruption a secret.Whilst we understand that everyone deserves a holiday this is totally inconsiderate to people like ourselves and others who have paid a good deal of money for a relaxing time.  Needless to say, we will not be returning!"
Jun 2019,30,"Child friendly, not solo traveller friendly","If you want a large resort that is child friendly then this is it. There is a dedicated kids area and many shallow pools. There is a quieter pool for adults near the main entrance tho. GRSE is 2 km from the ‘strip’ and further from historic Albufeira although they have a free shuttle. Drinks here are more than double the cost  elsewhere and the evening buffet is €32 each. The other restaurants on site are no better and of you are solo, you need to chase the staff for drinks or your bill. Breakfast however is fresh and replaced quickly for a resort of this size. Did I say it is for families?"
Jun 2019,40,Good 5 Star hotel without internet access in the room,"Good hotel, very friendly staff, several restaurants. A missed chanceou cannot charge to the room in one of the restaurants. WiFi is good in pblic places, but most of the time no internet connection or if so, no or poor access in the room. Had to complain 2 times before taking action by maintenance. Reset should fix the problem, but regrettably not."
Jun 2019,50,location location location,"Excellent hotel in a prime location. Staff both helpful and friendly. Book a sea view if possible, comes with a balcony big enough to party on! Breakfast very good, evening meal posh food a bit expensive but it is a 5 star restraint."
Jun 2019,50,Sergio and Denise,We stayed this time for leisure but got married here in August 2016. It still remains an amazing place to be looking over St Eulalia beach. The staff are very kind and helpful. Another wedding took place during our stay and it was lovely to watch from the poolside. Angela who organises the weddings is an amazing contribution to the hotel.
Jun 2019,50,Fabulous place,Great hotel next to beach.Great food and service. Very friendly staff superbly run hotel.restaurants on the beach serving great seafood and other variety would highly recommend. Free shuttle bus service into albufuria. Will revisit
Jun 2019,40,Beautifull view,"Beautiful locallocation! Big and spacey lobby and poolside as well as a quick walk to the beach! The rooms was a little disappointing but they were clean and not to smal. The hotels has two great restaurants right outside with nice prices. The hotel has a burger restaurant that’s ok, I’m not too into burgers but they were ok and the view is amazing! It’s very family friendly and even though the hotel is big, the employees recognize you and are really nice!"
Jun 2019,30,Not what it was,"Large groups of wedding guests taking over pool area. They were not residents of hotel but just came in each day to use facilities.  I understand weddings are an important revenue stream, but my husband could not use stairs while photgrapher was taking wedding photos.  We are residents too. We paid to stay but were made to feel like we shouldnt be there.  LParts of hotel shabby while on previous visits it has always been well maintained. Missing tiles in pool etc just small details but very noticeable."
Jun 2019,40,Lovely family holiday,Fantastic location Large family apartments A few English tv channels goodShuttle bus to town 10 mins AwayPools at apartments lovely Bar very expensive hardly drank there Beautiful beach on your doorstep 5 mins stroll from hotel
Jun 2019,30,Way to expensive for what it offers,"This 5stars hotel is really a 3 and half star hotel.Too expensive , apartments old fashion, food in the pool is mediocre... The reception is ok , staff are friendly ...The beach nearby is regular (you can find much better nearby).Well, it’s a 3 out of 5 rating"
Jun 2019,50,Excellent break,My wife and I have just come back from a seven day vacation and have had a lovely relaxing break. Lovely Hotel and really lovely staff. They were always friendly approachable and nothing was too much trouble. The food in all areas was lovely and plenty to chose from. It could be the time of year but entertainment was not brilliant. Will definitely be back
May 2019,50,Our babymoon,"Perfect little place for our long weekend, for a our baby moon. So chilled and lovely. Excellent service and lovely staff. We did have 2 single beds pushed together - which we weren’t happy about, but nothing to complain about. We had a room with a sea view, the balcony was huge and the view was fab. The hotel Didn’t disappoint at all. We will be back."
May 2019,50,Lovely hotel,"We came for a week at the end of May-19 - 5 adults & 4 children. We had two self catering apartments - a 1 room & a 2 room. Reception staff were brilliant. Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived (middayish). So, they changed us to an apartment that was ready & was next to the others in our party 😊. Located east of Albufeira with a short walk down to a lovely beach. Albufeira Old Town 4.5k away & walkable but along the road (not a seaside prom!). Did it a few times with a pushchair 😅. Modern & well appointed hotel (except for outside our apartment where woodwork needed attention; woodwork had been removed from most other apartments). Loads of space & clothes storage capacity 😊. Adequate self catering facilities (no oven).  Kept very clean with daily housekeeping 🙌. Fairly well kept grounds; not too good for pushchairs/wheelchairs; some slopes to the beach, but can’t avoid steps. Pool bar closes at 6pm, but no probs getting a drink just after 😊. Hotel uses a specific taxi firm that was excellent with good vehicles & children’s seats etc. Special mention for excellent Magy  who also advised on restaurants etc 🙌. We booked our return airport transfer with her (cheaper than taxi from airport). Several swimming pool areas. None suitable for proper swimming, but good for kids. Two pools in main area are heated (a bit). Good gym with ample equipment; open until 8pm. If you are self catering there is a large Intermarche Supermarket west about 2k. Taxi firm (Magy) waited for us & only charged €10 return 😊. Two smaller supermarkets east 1 & 1.5k (further one better for fresh food). We had a lovely evening buffet at the hotel’s main restaurant. Very good range, quality & service 😊.  Portobello restaurant opposite the hotel is OK & very reasonably priced, especially if you have children. Quick, but not rushed service. They also do good takeaways pizzas. We would return."
May 2019,30,Nice Hotel 2nd Stay,2nd time we stayed.  Noticed a difference this year.  The first room we were given had paint coming of the walls.  This was dealt with very quickly but not one person actually apologised for inconvenience of moving.  We have stayed at many 5 star accommodation and didnt expect to see this. The apartments were not booked out so couldnt understand why we were put in a room which obviously needed work on.  The beds are extremely uncomfortable.  When we left I didnt get asked were we happy with our stay.  Shame as we had raved about the hotel to our boys which we brought with us this time. Definitely noticed a difference from last September's stay.
May 2019,50,Just outstanding,"Outstanding beach resort with great Menities for couples and families , a variety of hotel rooms and villasGrounds are spectacular and great location near the beach and walking distance to center of town"
May 2019,50,Great location and friendly service,"You couldn't pick a better spot, right on the beach and with 3 different pool areas available as well. The service was always friendly and helpful. My garden-facing room was a bit lacking in views but nonetheless quite comfortable."
May 2019,40,The best 3 nights,"Me and my partner stayed here for 3 nights for his birthday. Upon arrival the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location, we prefer the party scene so we went out to the new town every night. We got a taxi that only cost us 5 Euro’s. The pools were of good size and there was plenty of sun beds available. The breakfast was great too. The only downside I would say is that the rooms are extremely dated, and they don’t seem to have been updated since the 80’s! This didn’t affect our stay though as we didn’t spend much time in the room. Overall I would 100% recommend and will hopefully be back very soon."
May 2019,50,"Kind staff, beautiful property","I was here for a business event, so did not handle many of the logistics myself. Nonetheless, I had a lovely stay at this beautiful location. All of the staff were very kind and helpful. The conference rooms were great as well."
May 2019,50,Excellent resort.,"My wife and I stayed in a self catering apartment at this resort for 8 days. Couldn't praise it enough, lovely clean apartment, beautiful pools and beach, plenty of sun loungers, excellent hotel facilities, very helpful  and friendly staff, the list goes on. This resort is ideally located a short walk from many good restaurants and bars yet far enough away not to have a noise problem and we didn't see one hen or stag. We will definitely be back."
May 2019,40,Terrific sea view,The hotel location and service were very good. We had an excellent time. I have three recommendations for improvement; the rooms have all the amenities needed but are tired and in need of updating. Despite staying in the hotel we had to book a treatment to use the spa pool. Treatments were overpriced and I felt this was a little mean given that the swimming pools outside were more like plunge pools. It would also be great to have a shower that can be used when leaving the beach.
May 2019,50,Amazing hotel at great value.,"This is a perfectly located hotel for those who want to visit Albufeira but also enjoy a fantastic beach, pool and relaxation experience. The restaurants are expensive, but the food quality is fantastic. The free shuttle bus provided means that one can easily access more affordable restaurants in Albufeira. The breakfast buffet is one of the best I have encountered, with a huge range of foods to suit all diets and tastes. We would 100% stay in this hotel again, as there is so much to do here we didn’t even get the chance to make full use of everything provided (from free language classes, to tennis courts, to an amazing spa)."
May 2019,50,Love this place!,"We have stayed here on several occasions and each time has been wonderful! The only issue is the sofa bed, it’s not very comfortable to sleep on, but I’ll suffer it to save paying £500 extra for a 2 bed apartment!"
May 2019,40,Very good.,The location is amazing. Fabulous breakfasts the drinks are very high. The exterior is starting to look a bit shabby. Needs a paint update. Fantastic weather and we have been 4/5 times so must be good.
May 2019,50,Annual trip,Everything was good.  Only problem was last day we had power cut which stopped some tv programs and wifi for a day.  External problem not hotel.  While there a friend in UK contacted me about possible location for a wedding next August. They need accommodation for 90 people and I recommended this hotel to look at.
May 2019,50,Ticks all the boxes,"This place had everything. Amazing location, fantastic beach, lots to do and staff that couldn’t do enough to help. The spa facilities were great and so was the gym. I only ate occasionally as there are so many restaurants nearby you are spoilt for choice."
May 2019,50,Awesome Resort,"Thoroughly enjoyed a week in this resort. We stayed in a suite - well equipped, spotlessly clean, comfy bed, adjustable air con, tea and coffee facilities, luxurious soft towels and an iron sent to room within ten minutes of it being requested. Bathrooms were spacious, clean and modern.We stayed half board and ate evening meals rather than lunches. Breakfasts and dinners were simply fabulous. A wide choice of delicious food and attentive, polite staff.The pool area is super with a great choice of pools and areas to lie in the sun or shade. The sun beds are all comfortable and firm.The beach is a short walk from the pool area and is perfect for a stroll and a dip.There is a good choice of where to have lunch and, once again, all meals were lovely.The free shuttle bus is clean and modern and reliable.In conclusion we would all highly recommend the resort and would definitely return in the future."
May 2019,50,Excelent stay,"It was a pleasure to be there. Service was excellent, room was quite big, bed was huge and very comfortable, bathroom nice and clean. View to the pool and Ocean was really nice. Great breakfast with variety of products, but I would appreciate more kind of fresh vegs, not only tomatoes.We loved the pool which have a nice view to the ocean. It's great there is an entrance to the beautiful beach which is few steps from the hotel.There is live music few times a week at the evenings - which I adored - it's very nice and relaxing after whole of activities.What I found a bit funny is a set of tea/coffie bags in a room which are paid. Does hotel really need to charge 1.5E from customer who already paid 120E/night for every bag of tea?"
May 2019,50,Love this place!,"Happy customer this & last year! Service and quality high, affordable prices, great location, beautiful views. Beach & pools to choose from. Close to town but equally private if you wish to be so. Thank you."
May 2019,40,Love this hotel,Hotel is gorgeous. I do think they should provide milk with tea and coffee in the rooms. Lighting for make up for women is an issue in the rooms also. Beach restaurant is great but only when the one guy is there running it. Last 2 days sat and Sunday he wasn’t there and service was really poor. Bills were wrong and had to queue just to pay the bill as waitresses were not on the ball
May 2019,50,Wonderful wonderful Grande Real Santa Eulalia,"I couldn't believe we got such a great place to stay for such value.   It was a dream break. A dream location.    The staff were all  so kind and helpful.  The food, the amazing wifi even down on the beach. We are planning our return again next year.  It was my first time in Portugal."
May 2019,50,4 night break,Absolutely georgous hotel service was brilliant and not over priced nothing was to much bother will defenatly be coming back and I will defenatly recommend ❤ everything I could have wanted in a holiday and more thankyou for making my 25th anniversary extra special xx
May 2019,10,"Not the same hotel like in picture, no every day water of bottle, in all places smells like in old houses,food expensive","First if all its not same hotel like in picture, food expensive and no choise to have light breakfast only all included in 19€ and you can eat how you want... no fresh water every day in hotel room and its 5 stars hotel. Hotel looks like before bankrot. I changed 3 rooms and smell in two of this was like old house, terible expierence."
May 2019,50,60th birthday holiday,Excellent holiday with excellent service all round!Provided bottle bubbly and good size cake with glasses plates etc in room when we returned back from day out! Lovely surprise!Only recommendation is when booking suite with sea view go for the higher floors as we could not see much in room 137!
May 2019,40,Under wandering star,"ad a very nice stay, too short to see and experience everything. In room would add sockets or extension cord, when one travels with tablet, phone etc which need to be charged, would be nice to have socket next to bed. I am not a morning person while on holiday so breakfast in a big restaurant was a disappointment, too many people too much noise. Food was very good, but could not handle the noise, so had my coffee in bar."
May 2019,40,Lovely place,"I’m writing this on our last night in the resort, l can honestly say could not find fault with anything from the accommodation to the staff. 4 of us & 1 child had a 2 bed 2 bath apartment (520) very spacious & spotlessly clean we used the Atlantic Resteraunt in the daytime a couple of times,  reasonably priced, also used rm’s up the road a couple of times, excellent food & service also tried portobellos across the road for pizza this was also good. Loads of food choices in town, the old town that is. Warning! Avoid the new town strip, makes magaluf look classy!"
May 2019,40,Not bad...,"The Hotel and Resort ist interesting and quite good, but it's the small things that would have made my stay even more pleasurable: a make-up mirror in the bathroom (especially because both the bathroom mirror and the room mirror are very distant from the user because ""hidden"" by a deep washstand and a deep table), a well-working air conditioning right from the start, better lighting in the room (there are two lamps by the nightstand, one tiny and very weak one on the opposite wall and a floor lamp whose switch is hidden behind a heavy armchair and therefor cannot be used... And I could keep going with those ""little"" things..."
May 2019,50,Fantastic hotel beautiful location,"We spent 5 nights at this hotel bed and breakfast and had the most amazing holiday! The hotel really is lovely with such friendly helpful staff, location is perfect just 5 minutes away from the main strip which the hotel runs a free shuttle bus to old town and new town. The views from this hotel and just stunning! I really couldn’t recommend this resort enough and we already can’t wait to come back again next year."
May 2019,40,Relaxing break,"Really nice and friendly hotel. Only faults I found were no showers at the gym, and noise from next appartment in the self catering is annoying, if you have late nighters as neighbours! Otherwise, fabulous place."
May 2019,30,Could be much better for five stars,"Nice hotel, good location, friendly staff, but a lot of maintenance should be done, specially in the rooms: aircondition was not cooling, towel rail was ragged, make-up mirror was missing ... The beach towels were really small and in bad quality,"
May 2019,50,Great Hotel and Wonderful Staff,"Stayed for wedding, beautiful venue, staff were so friendly and helpful.  Really enjoyed.  Lots of swimming pools and right beside a lovely beach.  Great Breakfast.  Several restaurants in hotel and also lots within walking distance as is the new town"
May 2019,30,Family holiday,"This hotel is not 5 star. Rooms were okay, cleaning was average, sometimes no towels replaced or toilet roll, had to ask at reception. Buffet dinner was not great. Breakfast was average, no gluten free or dairy free options. No smoothies which I would expect from a decent hotel. Also large queues for breakfast, not enough tables to accommodate number of guests. Entertainment was below average. But my biggest complaint is that I chose this hotel as it had an indoor pool and sauna, however we were then told it was an extra €20 per person per hour to use it. This is disgraceful! The location of hotel is good and we had a lovely view but we will not return."
May 2019,50,Definitely recommend,"Staff are super friendly, the food is gorgeous with very little wait time. The breakfast had a huge selection & would definitely recommend people to get breakfast included, it’s definitely worth it. Great location, 2 min walk to beach which has a water sports facility. Will definitely be back again!"
May 2019,50,Fabulous hotel and location,"Hotel fully deserved its 5* rating. Service was excellent with all staff very helpful. Quality and choice of food and beverages was excellent, if a little pricier than in town. Room was a good size, with a good balcony,  was clean and had everything needed. Toiletries and towels refreshed daily. Towels for pool/beach provided. The location was very good, close enough to walk into Santa Eulalia and Albufeira if wanting a livelier atmosphere, but far enough out to have a quiet, relaxing environment. Hotel also provided free shuttle service throughout the day. A very enjoyable experience all round."
May 2019,50,Lovely place to stay,Just returned from a 10 day trip and had a great time. The location is stunning (it is in a bay on the beach and has virtually the whole use of the bay). The facilities offered by the hotel are excellent. Breakfast is a food explosion with a wide range of options presented buffet style. The pools were never overly busy and the beach big enough to unsure you aren't sitting on top of one another.The only slightly negative things I could say were that despite having a lot of swimming pools none of them are really big enough for someone who likes to swim rather than dip and if I went again (which I am fairly sure I will be) I would opt for a sea view room rather than a resort view (we were on the ground floor facing onto the car park/main entrance). Oh and I think the signage marking the entrance to the hotel could be a bit more prominent for first time visitors (we arrived in the dark and missed it first time round). Only minute niggles. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
May 2019,40,Great Hotel in a Great Setting,Very nice hotel with easy access to the beach. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which was really spacious. Very good facilities for smaller kids. Only criticism I would have is that the food could have been better. Other than that though it was a great stay and I would definitely return.
May 2019,50,Good and peaceful hotel,"Nice hotel with pools, tennis courts and beach close by. Hotel room A/C was quite noisy but that was only minus side. Service was kind and a lot of gluten free option on breakfast buffet. Waiter knew for sure what means gluten free diet for celiac people :)City is pretty close, less than 2km and taxi was only 5€ though walking was also ok."
May 2019,50,Great Hotel - fantastic value!,"Spent four nights at the Grand Real Santa Eulalia and it exceeded expectations. The ambience was great, staff very pleasant and helpful and was very clean. The a la carte lunch on our last day was absolutely amazing! I enjoyed everything about my stay. Would definitely book again!"
May 2019,40,very nice stay,My wife and I have just stayed 2 nights at the Grande Santa Eulalia and overall It was a very nice stay we stayed in the self catering apartments which were nice with good facilities I do not know the difference in the price but the hotel itself seemed a much nicer place to stay as I would say the mail hotel is fine to be classed 5 star but the apartments are not we did no eat at the hotel as we found it expensive it has a very nice private beach but it does lead into the public beach and does not include any sunbeds etc free with the hotel it has nice swimming pools that do offer sunbedsThe staff on reception was very nice and they had a shuttle into the main town which was very good. I would have said this hotel was better than I have said apart from the cleaning our room and the wardrobes had a terrible musty smell the cleaners knock on our room to clean it at 09.30am which when on holiday is very earlier we said we were not ready but they did not come back which was not a problem but not 5 star service if the hotel worked harder on the cleaning side I would say this hotel was fairly rated at 5 star but for our stay not so
May 2019,50,Beautiful Resort with very nice staff,"Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and Spa is a beautiful facility.  The rooms and bathroom are very spacious.  There is plenty of drawers and closets to store your clothes.  We booked an ocean view which had a stunning view of the grounds and the beach.  The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful as were the restaurant staff.  I want to give a special shout out to Lidia at the pool bar, who is very friendly and makes the best caipirinhas.  I would love to come here for another holiday!  Thank you for making our first holiday in Algarve very special!"
May 2019,50,Recomend for everybody!!!,"Lovely hotel. Excellent staff, I liked everything, great rooms, daily housekeeping. 3 warm pools, pools for children, playgrounds, a private beach. Huge parking for cars. I did not want to leave !!! Perhaps this is the most important thing !!! I recommend everyone, you will not regret. Happy to come back again and again."
May 2019,40,Good 5 starts hotel,"I stayed for 2 nights in this hotel in Albufeira, Algarve.The rooms are luxurious and very comfortable and the staff is very polite and actively willing to serve you.Breakfast was good, but for these class of hotels you would expect more diversity.The hotel has a private access to a small beach, which is very convenient."
May 2019,30,Great location not 5 stars,"Great location, excellent front desk service and the snack bar overlooking the sea was great.The hotel needs updating, it’s clean but the service levels are poor - Not 5 star for sure.Breakfast is chaotic and very limited in variety and quality  with no fresh cooking stations for eggs which is commonplace in most hotels 4* and above. No waiter/waitress service for hot drinks.p at breakfast. The maid service was terrible, glasses not cleaned and hot drink sachets not replenished unless you ask. The price we paid looked very reasonable and I suspect that’s because you do not receive 5 star service levels. Love the location but the area has changed alot in the 5 years since we last visited. It’s now a Stag and Hen weekend destination (Albuferia old town) so there’s a feel of Magaluf strip about this area now which is fine if that’s what you like."
May 2019,40,Nice hotel and apartment complex,Stayed in a one bed apartment Spotlessly cleaned and daily maid serviceDated decor but adequately equipped and spaciousBar drinks extremely expensive but luckily it’s walking distance to bars and restaurants in the new town. Convenient complimentary shuttle service to both old and new town
May 2019,40,Kids loved it,My sons would rate it 11/10 if possible. They absolutely loved it. It has a couple of nice pools and very easy access to the beach. And the scenery is really nice. I have rated it down a little bit as our apartment was somewhat worn and would need an overhaul.
May 2019,50,Wow!!,"We were here for my best friends wedding and we LOVED the place! Apartment was spotless, cute & comfortable. Service was unbelievable food was fabulous !!I'd love to come back asap !! Would defintly recxomemd to a friend"
May 2019,30,Won’t be returning,"Stayed here recently for two nights, my fiancé had emailed the hotel to say we were visiting as we were viewing the hotel as a possible wedding venue next year.Check in was fine, then we were shown to our room. The corridor absolutely stank of stale cigarettes, carpets worn & room was very basic facing trees.We had breakfast both mornings it was fine.Rang reception first morning requesting an iron & it never arrived despite two phone calls.The staff are not friendly , the pool areas are nice but we’re Definately glad we stayed here as we immediately ruled it out as a wedding venue. Much nicer hotels in the area for similar prices."
May 2019,40,great location by the beach,"this hotel is situated in a lovely location on the beach, though its rated as a five star the apartments though very comfortable and spotlessly clean are quite tired and could really do with updating.The kids club staff were amazing. My little boy is special needs and they went out of their way to make him feel included. He had a great time."
May 2019,50,Beautiful and Serene,Beautiful and well maintained hotel. Staff are very helpful polite . Food and breakfast bar was good.  Good bus services to get around town. Room are clean but may need some touching up . overall experience was great. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends
May 2019,50,great service,"in one word fantastic, it was beautifulall my guest are planning a revisit .we were welcomed and treated wellwe travel for a family function the service was excellent, the event planners, Angela and Patricia are a force to reckon with, they made sure everything was in order, they took away every stress and handled the occasion with the pose of their excellent skills, I am forever indebted. I intend to maintain a close relationship."
May 2019,50,Great stay and Friendly Staff,Had a lovely stay at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia recently for a friends wedding. The staff at the hotel were fantastic. The rooms were extremely clean with stunning views and a lovely balcony area too.
May 2019,50,Room Cleaning and Tourist Information,"As a 5* hotel, I expected complimentary tea, coffee and milk in the room everyday and not just for one day. Cups and glasses were not cleaned everyday. When I approached the chambermaid regarding the replacement of bath floor towel, her response was a stern and angry - no!  There was no local map or tourist information at reception desk.  We had to ask for a map"
May 2019,50,Beautiful views,"My stay in Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort was a short 4 night stay, beautiful hotel, ideal location with private beach.Would definitely recommend this place to any staying in Albufeira.The staff was amazing very helpful and I would give it a 5* feel.Breakfast was nice good variety of food and fresh fruit."
May 2019,50,So good - been back 2 times,"I first came to this hotel coordinating a conference with work in March and enjoyed it so much I returned just 1 month later for a personal family holiday.Like most of Portugal the staff are friendly and the standards are extremely high (relatively compared with other Southern Europe countries). The staff were during both stays very efficient and professional, and the hotel was a great experience. For my conference, the staff were as helpful as possible and never refused any task or request to try and benefit our group. This helped our event run smoothly and I would personally like to single out Pedro Portela for all his help.For my personal stay, I returned during the Easter holiday time so much higher season. Even so, the staff were still really friendly and helpful but more importantly this hotel just gave the impression it could manage successfully - even with high occupancy. For example, there was still always sunbeds available by the swimming pool, it was still possible to get a table in all the restaurants for dinner, and there were still seats available in the lounge during the evening entertainment. This is something worth mentioning, as from travel experience I've found in other countries / hotels often it can be frustrating being away at ""high season"". The hotels often feel very busy or there is never enough / free space to access fully the facilities.Finally I would recommend this hotel for families but also professionals wanting a break in the Algarve as this hotel has facilities to cater for all without being overpowering. A place I would truly recommend in the Albufeira region if I return in the future and would not hesitate to recommend to you to plan future visits. The only final point to realise is that this is a large hotel complex so it may not suit all but again as I said previously it doesn't feel overpowering."
May 2019,10,Does not deserve even 4 stars,"This resort definitely has had better times and needs in my opinion a major restructuring and an important reorganization. When we arrived we discovered that two out of four restaurants of the hotel were closed for dinner. One because they always keep it closed on Monday and the other because they had some technical problem. But if you have a technical problem in one of the restaurants you should have the flexibility of thinking to keep opened the other one, even if it is Monday. Breakfast works alright if weather is fine, because they use the terrace too. But if you have a rainy morning you will find yourself in a queue of 30/40 persons waiting to be seated. We have booked a suite but the room had nothing to do with a suite. The furniture showed evident signs of a lack in maintenance. The same may be said for the furniture in the lobby. The sofas there are so old that you might have some problem to find one that is not filthy. To use the spa we were requested to pay EUR 20/hour. Never heard something like that."
May 2019,40,Great location,We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite. It is huge with 2 bathrooms a kitchen and living room. The colours are bright and cheerful making the ambiance fun. The location is pretty good. You can walk to the super market and restaurants outside the resort. Anything else you can get a taxi or take the free shuttle. Although the free shuttle only runs 6 or 7 times a day starting at 10:30 and ending at 18:30. Overall a great place to stay with a very nice beach and plenty of pools. (P.S. Some of the staff is friendly some not so much.)
May 2019,50,Short break,"Self catering break, great hotel studio room very clean, no welcome pack ! And no information pack which made it harder to find supermarkets. Very good free bus service to old town. Bar prices higher on the night recommend the short walk 15 minutes to the town."
May 2019,50,Amazing holiday,"Beautiful hotel and complex , cannot praise highly enough . Visited with my daughter and we be returning next year with my grandchildren as the kids facilities looked amazing. Free bus to strip and old town ."
May 2019,50,"Wow, better than I remembered","I came here as a last minute pre Christmas girlie trip in December 2018. The resort was beautiful, with out of the ordinary temperatures for that time of year; being in the mid 20’s. I was so impressed with everything that I rebooked on my return home for me and my husband. In fact we are here now; halfway through our weeks break. We booked a sea view room this time round and wow, I am just astounded. I could sit on the balcony all day taking in that view, but then I would miss out on the delicious breakfast complete with champagne! Not to mention the Spa and other amenities. My husband has been really impressed, such lovely staff and the picturesque Old Town, a real highlight. Will be back again later in the year. That says it all really!"
May 2019,50,Clean and fantasic venue,"We booked the one bedroom Appartment 402, fantastic spacious one bedroom Appartment, very clean and cleaning staff done a great job everyday Highly recommended and staff very friendly .... the only downside the Spa below average I will give the spa three stars max"
May 2019,40,Overall service,"My wife and I enjoyed our 5 nights stay at your Hotel, and our giving a “very good” rating reflects that.Needless to say, we have rebooked for another stay later in the year.Areas for improvement is the air conditioning in the rooms - one cannot have not too cool airflow in the summer, although the thermostat setting was placed at 26 degrees.  Plus, of course, the not too frequent shuttle bus service to town - the Manager needs to implement an hourly bus service, which will be most welcomed by guests.All in all, almost within touching distance of an excellent rating."
Apr 2019,50,"Excellent hotel, great location","We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 night stay at this hotel. Location is wonderful, quiet and beautiful setting on a beach. The staff are extremely friendly, the rooms are big and clean. The facilities are spotless and it is short distance to main city. Would highly recommend."
Apr 2019,30,Kids club disaster,We booked this hotel solely because kids club was running at the time. In fact we only used it once for 90 minutes as the manageress was extremely rude if not aggressive because we were two minutes late the first day we left the kids there. One of them had been crying and didn’t want to go back so that was that. They always love kids clubs.
Apr 2019,40,Grand Real,"On the whole an excellent hotel. Disappointing to find a 5* hotel charging €1.50 for a refill of a tea bag or coffee sachet and 0.50 cent for sugar, if using the tea coffee provided in the rooms. Something more suited to a budget airline with add on extras .. rather than a 5* Hotel . Really lowers the tone of the Hotel. pity ."
Apr 2019,50,Birthday break,"I can't say much more than fantastic. Brilliant location. Lovely beach easily reached in 2 mins. Shuttle bus a bonus to take to old town. Rooms comfortable and cleaned daily. Breakfast good. The staff excellent always ready to help. Thanks to all the staff especially Ines, raphael, and Jorge. Execelent guys."
Apr 2019,50,Fantastic spot,"Fantastic hotel, very well maintained and excellent facilities.  Fantastic food - the buffet breakfast was quite special and the champagne was lovely. Views from hotel were stunning.  Gorgeous to have lunch overlooking the beautiful beach.Fabulous staff.  Rooms were very comfortable and spotlessly clean.  Cleaning ladies did a great job every day.  We will be back next summer - no doubt about it."
Apr 2019,40,Easter Break,"Good for families.  Friendly service, clean rooms, great facilities for young kids.  The only downside was the lack of a shop for milk / bread / water, which was a good 10-15 minute walk away. Not great when staying in self catering accommodation."
Apr 2019,40,Great location,"My husband & I stayed here for 1 week with our two teenage children. The location is fantastic, right above the beautiful beach, just a few easy slopes to get down.Old town & new town both an easy walk & the free hotel shuttle bus ran perfectly on time. Staff very efficient, professional & friendly. Jerome on reception particularly helpful.Hotel kept very clean throughout but the room could have been more thoroughly cleaned. I had to ask for my balcony & outside table to be cleaned as it was grubby. One bottle of water provided to the room on the first night only, that’s not great & no tea or coffee making facilities in room.Two pools outside, smaller one was heated but larger not.Breakfast was ok & the vegans in the family coped although the offerings could have been more varied & rich. We were uninspired to try the evening buffet here.Very disappointed to see animals being used for entertainment in the reception area, there are enough entertainment options available without having to resort to this. There was an iguana & a parrot on various evenings. Would be better to offer a children’s entertainer & quality musicians. Also disappointed to see single use plastic cups & straws in the day cafe overlooking the beach. Spa was unavailable for use by under 16’s yet we had to pay full adult room price for our teenage children. Not fair. Looked like a lovely indoor pool but only available to adults and for a fee as well.We were lucky we had great weather during our stay otherwise we would have struggled to find something to do in the hotel."
Apr 2019,40,Perfect location,"In general the place is very nice, the location perfect, the room ok, pool, food, services excellent. I think by the way, that it is more a 4 than a 5 star hotel. The only complain would be for the third bed that was extremely uncomfortable. I really cannot understand how in such a hotel, an added bed can be so minimalist, bent in the middle, with a mattress of max 8 (?) cm. We stayed 5 nights, enough for having back ache all the week.We were three and two times I had to ask for the third towel in the room."
Apr 2019,40,Amazing views and lovely pool close to beach,"The service was really disappointing – the staff were short, unhelpful and very rude, and in no rush either. We stayed off-peak so the Hotel wasn't even at capacity – based on this, I wouldn't stay again. However, the hotel itself was lovely and the views and proximity to the ocean was amazing. Great location as well."
Apr 2019,40,Could be better,"Just returned with family’s . Ok fist the good location is excellent beach is gorgeous . Apt ok clean and nice bathroom.  Service at the bar very slow and entertainment ok but nothing special.Hotel needs a  mini market like all other hotels close buy would be useful . Pool areas are all decked beware of splinters we had a few and broken decking in places.Basically the hotel needs maintenance looking very tired in places as many others have mentioned.Ok I would give the hotel 4 * not a 5 . Would I come back well that would depend on the price,"
Apr 2019,50,Fantastic family destination,"Terrific hotel with fantastic facilities and top class service throughout. Brilliant kids club, lovely beach and swimming pools. Staff very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend this hotel for family holidays!"
Apr 2019,40,"Comfortable beds, friendly staff, clean surroundings ","I’ve just come back from a very pleasant 4 night stay in this lovely hotel. The reception staff were all friendly and helpful, but especially Rüben, who was exceptional in dealing with requests and giving information about nearby excursions. I stayed in a suite, which was spacious and clean. There isn’t much to do in the area, but it’s perfect for a short break if you just want to relax by the beach, which is literally a few yards away. I would have given it a 5 star rating had it not been for the extra charge to use the spa facility, and not being able to control the room temperature; it’s either set too cold or hot, with no way of manually controlling it. The hotel is child friendly so expect to see a lot of kids running around! My nieces loved the kids club so I would recommend the hotel to anyone travelling with children."
Apr 2019,40,"Decent Hotel, value for money","We went for a few days leading up to the Easter Holidays and had a relaxing time. Our flight arrived very early in the morning and we were at the hotel about 4-5 hours before check in, but the staff were very accommodating, allowing us to check in. The apartment is spacious, adequate for a family of four. We were placed in one of the apartments towards the front of the resort, consequently close to the main road. This wasn't any issue though. There is an on site gymn and spa and 4 outdoor pools and a paddle pool. One pool is ""heated"" but tended to be crowded. There is a small supermarket within a 3 minute walk and a larger Intermarche a 15 minute walk away.  The free shuttle service to the New and old towns is a plus - though take note that when it's busy, being British queueing up comes naturally but that may work against you as other guests just turned up at the last minute and boarded. Staff are so friendly even where there is a language barrier.  Proximity to the beach is another plus for this resort. It is definitely family friendly, comfortable and we will visit again."
Apr 2019,50,Brilliant,"The whole stay was lovely. Hotel itself was really nice. Perfect location,  with a shuttle bus in and out of new/old town. (€3 to new town in a taxi) Gym and spa were nice. Outdoor pools, few minutes walk to the beach, great facilities and the staff were overall very helpful. Reasonably priced. Cocktails were great. Breakfast was brilliant. Board games available at reception. The resort in all had everything you could want. Would definitely go back."
Apr 2019,30,A very average hotel with 5 stars.,"Have been going to Albufeira / Olhos de Agua for many years and have ""eyed this place up"" quite a few times. We are huge fans of this part of the world and had high expectations of this hotel as we assumed that the 5 star rating would mean it was even better than the places (3 star and 4 star) that we had previously stayed in. Not so unfortunately. This is a Spa hotel first and foremost. It is not suitable for families with younger children (8 and 4). The ""apartment"" is very badly equipped for families. There is only a small 2 ringed hob and the sink doesn't even have a draining board. There is no shop / minimarket for basic provisions! We asked 4 times for a a clothes airer to dry our clothes (bathing suits etc) outside and this very simple request remained unfulfilled for the duration of our stay (one week). There is very little for kids to do onsite .... again this is a Spa hotel for adults or parents with independent (teenage) kids. The indoor swimming pool is for ""Spa guests only"" and incurs a supplement of €20 per adult per visit! We spent our time next door most days at a neighbouring 3 star hotel which had a huge play park in it etc. We found the 3 star hotel to be much more suitable for our needs and way more welcoming …. basically the kids loved it and we have already booked it for next summer (the 3 star hotel that is)."
Apr 2019,50,Amazing!!,We ended up here after Teletext Holidays messed up our booking for Real Marina Residence. So glad we did. Had a 1 bed apartment very spacious and clean. Quite noisy as next to the main road but was late so couldn’t be bothered to ask to be moved. Soon got used to it though. Also foisty smell coming from the cupboard in the hall area. The service and friendliness of the staff was impeccable and would definitely return. Drinks a little expensive compared to bars/restaurants outside of the hotel. Free shuttle to old and new towns which we took advantage of one day. Only ate in the Cozinha restaurant as we were half board. Breakfast and Dinner choices extensive as were house drinks. We used the pool bar once for food and drinks again very good. Also used Real Bar most nights. Live music very good. Hotel leads down to Santa Eulália beach. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel. Thank you we will return.
Apr 2019,50,Beautiful resort,"Overall a 5 for the stay - amazing seafood restaurant (special mention to the staff there who were wonderful particularly with our 5yr old) andjust wow at the beach! So peaceful. Stayed self catering 1 bed and more than adequate. Food pricey but worth it. Kids club super - again great staff and activities.... He didn't want to hang out with us much! Only point... Staff at beach cafe a bit sour and slow service as were the bar staff at times but others made up for it. Overall a wonderful stay and highly recommended. Bus to town service great too. Thank you very much for our stay - Leanne, Nick and Jamie Hendry"
Apr 2019,40,Nice relaxing hotel with Spa and beautiful beach,"I had booked an other Real Hotel in Olhão, but because of overbooking my booking has been cancelled. They offered me Grand Real Santa Eulalia instead plus Spa free of costs. This hotel is rather far away from Albufeira Town, from train station and Airport. So I was using free shuttle bus to Albufeira Old Town and taxis plus train to Tavira, Faro, Silves, taxi to Loulé, and FatCats Transfer to Sagres and to the Airport.My room with ocean view was comfortable, very calm, I could sleep well. The bath with tub, spacious. When I asked for water boiler to make tea, it was brought to my room immediately. In the Spa I was using sauna, Turkish bath and thalasso pool with heated ocean water. It was nice and relaxing. There is also a small fitness."
Apr 2019,50,The best,"Loved everything about hotel especially the staff; a gentlemen at the reception called Joao Cruz he recommended us places to go, activities and gave us honest opinions about certain excursions and trips to take. He went above and beyond, the management should definitely see him as an asset to this hotel."
Apr 2019,40,Relaxing family stay,"We have opted to stay in a self catering apartment, which was the right option for us due to our children allergies and the actual cost of meals at the hotel. The location of the hotel was great - near enough to Faro airport (30-40 min drive) but also central enough to venture towards Silvas castle and Foia mountain one day and towards Lagos, Sagres and Cape St Vincent another day. We were very pleased with the service and immaculate daily clean of the apartment. The hotel itself was very nice and the access to the beach was useful. AS the sea was still quite cold, boys used mainly the heated pool and liked running from the heated pool to the cold pool and vice versa but also playing football with friends on the lawn next to the poolside bar. Our apartment was large and comfortable. The sofa bed in the living room is not that comfy for an adult but we only needed to use it as our little one is not a good sleeper. The bedroom bed is a queen size and very comfortable. We loved our stay and there are plenty of positives. The only one thing that we were discouraged by was the cost of food there (breakfast 20 Euros per adult on ad hoc basis), which we found a bit expensive."
Apr 2019,50,Amazing Stay!,"Amazing hotel and facilities! Could not believe how amazing the hotel and facilities were, very kind staff and the breakfast was incredible! Will definitely be returning with my future children in years to come!"
Apr 2019,50,Recent Stay,"we had a lovely stay and really appreciated the very kind gesture of a bottle of champagne delivered on arrival to our room from Hotel Management. Rooms were very comfortable, location was great.The only downside was having to pay to use the in-door swimming pool."
Apr 2019,40,Value for Money!,"We stayed for 4 nights and had an awesome experience! Have multiple options to spend time. Pool,Spa, Kids club, Beach etcShuttle services are really handy! Will definitely recommend this! True worth for Money!"
Apr 2019,50,Another great stay!,"This was our second visit to the hotel. Had a wonderful 2 weeks. Our room had a sea view which was lovely waking up to each morning. The room was clean and spacious, if I had one small problem it would be the comfort of the beds. They are very hard and I would recommend replacing them or at least put decent mattress toppers on them as I came home with a bad back. The mattress on the extra bed was also very poor and where it had been folded up in the base it was all compressed together leading to a mattress of two halves! That said, I would definitely go back as the hotel itself and staff are fantastic. It was great when some of the staff remembered us from last year! Loved the new sun beds, even if it was very busy around the pool."
Apr 2019,50,Great family friendly hotel,"Our second times staying in the hotel. I can't fault it in any way. Very clean grounds, spacious apartment, very friendly staff. The kids club was the highlight for our trip. My four year old ran to it every morning. The staff running it was very friendly. Lovely restaurant by the beach with very reasonable prices. Weather not great at this time of year but that can't be helped. Will definitely be returning."
Apr 2019,40,"Location, Location, Location!","We stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks in April.  The location is perfect - 100m from the beach!  We had a great sea view and could hear the ocean at night!  It was great!  The rooms are dated and old but very spacious!  The restaurant was excellent - we had an 8 month old with us and every meal (breakfast / dinner) they made fresh fruit and veggie puree' for our baby! The only real negatives I experienced was the maid cleaning service - it was horrible!  Many times we were left without towels and after the first few nights they even stopped leaving chocolates on my bed :(  The overall maintenance of the hotel and grounds was a dismal - it was old and needed a refreshment!  So, if you are looking for good food and service and a perfect beach location - this is your place!"
Apr 2019,30,Good Property but below average service,"We booked in reading great reviews of this place and were really surprised with our experience. One reason could be that I compare it with other 4-5 star experiences in hotels outside of Europe.In my honest opinion, this is a great property, really nice loction, very wide and beautiful campus to be a 5 star. However the services and facilities here dont even match a 3 star.We were supposed to be reaching very late for check in (around 11:45 pm) and had our 2 year old son accompanying us. You would expect to be checking in asap and retire to bed at that hour. Our check in was smooth and luggage was dropped in well. However we started having lot of issues with the room.Firstly we requested  a double bed sea view room. It was provided to us at 3rd floor with nice views, but 2 twin beds were joined. We had to chase the reception atleast 3 times before the staff came almost 30 min after first call dnd covered the layers over the 2 beds to make it one double bed.Second the Fridge was not working, we were carrying some food for us and our son which we could not store. As it was late, the reception told us they can only check it the morning after.The rooms dont have tea-coffee making facility (yes my first time in any hotel 4* and above). We still requested an electric kettle to heat up some of our baby food and it was a leaking kettle.The hotel doesnt provide you plates, bowls, glasses, cups, cutlery in room for free (yes another shock for me, never experienced this ever). They charge 5 Euro service fee everytime you ask them to bring any plates etc to the room.Finally when we could retire to sleep after all this, we realised the AC was not working in the room and it got really hot.I complained again the next day at reception. They did get the AC and Fridge fixed and it started working. However we realised that the temperature control of the AC was actually not working only showing the numbers, so we either used to switch on or switch off the AC for the rest of our stay as it was getting v cold.The kettle was replaced with another one whose auto cutoff was not working so we gave us raising these issues. There was a working chair in room which was work out and sagging and was not replaced as well.The room and bathroom furnishing was also dated and average, nothing new or fancy. I think the hotel is in need for  major refurb in the rooms.However the sea view from the room and balcony is amazing I admit and since we were on the 3rd floor it made it much better.Coming on the breakfast, it was a good english and continental breakfast spread with lots of options. No regional hot food is served though. However again, tea/coffee is self serve from a machine. No fresh brewed coffee on the table for you. Staff also not very warm, english is a challenge. Mostly the staff will hover around to pick plates from your table, even unfinished ones on occasions.Also it does get very very busy and crowded during breakfast, especially one sunday or closer to the finish time and you have to queue up for everything, getting a table also is a challenge and you keep on bumping into people and fighting for your servings.The pools are nice, 3 different in the hotel area and 2 more in the apartment area. Well maintained. The access to beach is the best part, they do provide towels for the beach. They have spa facilities but you cant access indoor pool or jacuzzi, sauna for free again. The hotel tends to charge you for everything which is considered  a standard 5 star facility and service, this puts you off.Campus as I mentioned is nice. They have a shuttle for new and old town which is convenient but it ends by around 6 pm.We rented a car and then it becomes very accessible, less than 5 min to The Strip, new town and 10-15 min for Marina.Also there was good children activities in the kids club, you need to really find out these locations as they are not very prominently marked. In the evenings they have either a live music or some children show to engage.If you want to enjoy the beach access, children activities, pool and have a nice view and ready to pay for everything else, this is a good place."
Apr 2019,50,vacation,"Great place on a beautiful beach. Staff are very courteous and most helpful.Our stay did not include any meals, but there are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. (5 to 10min). Most of these places have very reasonable prices and the service was excellent."
Apr 2019,50,Lovely Holiday,Great place for kids. The place and facilities are very goos. We stayed in the apartments and the layout of them was great. The rooms we very clean and the cleaning staff cleaned every day for us . Thank you
Apr 2019,30,Lunch by the sea,"Called into the restaurant by the sea for coffee and cake but stayed for beer and pizza. Fast efficient service but not warm and friendly, clean place with lovely views over the beach.  Tasty small pizza with a cold cold beer. Only fault no wifi..  in 2019?"
Apr 2019,20,Hotel review,Facilities for kids were very poor - nothing for a 10 year old at all. Pools small and overcrowded. Beds hard. Drinks were over priced and there were long long queues for breakfast - dining room too small to accommodate the number of guests. The dining room at peak times was frenetic! On the whole not 5 star resort - I would give it a 3 star.
Apr 2019,50,Family holiday to the sun,Excellent check in service with brilliant porter service. Two different birthdays in our party were each marked by the Management Team which was a very touching idea and very much appreciated.Breakfast options were amazing especially the selection of cheese and cakes and of course the sparkling wine. The balcony of the ground floor rooms at front of hotel was really not usable but the convenience of those rooms to the central lobby was brilliant as was the actual room itself. Musical entertainment in the bar at night was top class. Overall experience was excellent.
Apr 2019,50,Superb hotel stay,"I though the hotel reviews might be over rated but we weren't disappointed. The resort was fabulous, we stated in the apartments which were very close to the hotel with no difference from the hotel in access to anything. Amazing to be so close to a beautiful beach and swimming pools at the same time. Will definitely will be back again, staff were really warm and very helpful. Very clean with our apartments serviced daily. Hazel & Dave, Ireland."
Apr 2019,50,Excellent location and facilities,"Great location, great breakfast, very good service, and reasonably priced for what is provided.  Was quiet at night.  Great views of the water.  Free parking available.  Close to excellent food and shopping."
Apr 2019,40,Great stay - little improvements needed,"Overall a great stay, beautiful location with a free shuttle to old and new town. Staff are helpful and polite. Breakfast logistics is bedlam! There is no order and people just push in and nudge you out of the way. There is plenty of variety, but all a little cold and over cooked. Other than this everything else was excellent. Very busy hotel, our room was facing car park with a lot of coming and going."
Apr 2019,20,Sea view rooms are misleading,We’re staying here at the moment. The hotel is okay BUT we booked a sea view room (and paid more) on the basis of the pictures on the website which show a complete sea view. The attached is what we can actually see! When we spoke to the reception about this the lady just said well that is a sea view (as you can see the sea to the side of the balcony) and offered a worse room as an alternative. They need to be more honest about the reality of the rooms.
Apr 2019,50,Top spot,"Great hotel also nice self catering apartments, well located on the beach close to shops and restaurants.Polite and efficient service, good breakfast and great ice cream.Busy pool area and quiet pool area.Plenty parking, really enjoyable visit."
Apr 2019,50,Easter Break,"Great hotel located in the beautiful part of Albufeira within the reach of old and new town by the shuttle bus provided by the hotel. Great service, spacious clean rooms, delicious food. Amazing beach. Friendly and helpful staff. Had a relaxing break and would definitely come back."
Apr 2019,30,Value stay,The location of the hotel is great. The hotel offers activities for kids and adults. The reception staff very helpful. The hotel can use a renovation - it’s missing that warm homey feel or investment in the property.  The beach restaurant staff was very unfriendly...my daughter asked to try flavors of icecream and after three tries was told no more. Sounds silly but she is a picky eater and wanted to be sure in her choice. The forgot my room key on the table and when I went back to retrieve it the table was cleaned - I asked the waitress if it was found and without truly acknowledging said “no”. The place has potential - it’s the uncaring lack of customer service vibe that throws you off.
Apr 2019,40,Lovely relaxing holiday,"Great location, staff friendly and helpful. Only thing that lets it down is no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. Pools and resort very clean. Great Bus service to town. Beach is lovely and clean."
Apr 2019,10,Food very poor,Just back with my boyfriend from this hotel.  5star it is not. We didnt get a hot meal from we got there all our meals were luke warm or completely cold not impressed with selection either but what would that even matter as its too cold to eat.  Even on my last day i wanted something other than a fried breakfast as it was always freezing so went for porridge which was also cold.  If youve booked here i would stick to the fruit or the pure orange juice as its warmer that the cooked food.
Apr 2019,40,Relaxing Break away review,"We have stayed in the hotel 4 time previously and we love the hotel and specifically the location, service, beach and general relaxation of the rooms. This time (as we always do) we booked a seaview room but we had more of a ""Car Park"" view (room 225) than a sea view. This was a little disappointing as previously we loved , even in rainy weather, to look out at the beach from the room. With t his room in particular this was not possible without going outdoors. Overall we really love the Hotel and do plan to return again possibly later this year."
Apr 2019,40,Overall a very good trip,The only reason for 4 star is the apartment we were in could do with a little bit of maintenance (wall paper peeling off) & a bar staff member being quite abrupt. But others were very nice & helpful.There is a grassy open space in between the apartments where the pools are with a volleyball net and goal posts.The staff generally are very helpful and issues get fixed very quickly. We have been going here every Easter for the last five years and intend to return next year!
Apr 2019,30,A Stay in Portugal,We had a one bedroom apartment. The apartment was clean and quite spacious with a nice patio outside. We did not rent a car. It was quite a rough walk to carry groceries home from the store. I wish there had been a washing machine in the unit or a coin laundry onsite. For a 7 week stay it is too expensive to use the hotel laundry services.My husband had an accident and we had to leave early. The hotel staff and the guide for the group were extremely helpful. I would only return to this location if there was a stay at the hotel with a meal package. The hotel lobby and surrounding were lovely.In February the restaurants near the hotel were closed so I think March would be a much better month there.
Apr 2019,50,Absolute paradise,"From the moment we arrived we knew we had definitely picked the right place to stay! The hotel staff were very friendly and were really helpful with any questions we had, they recommend a few places and showed us directly to our room. The pool area is beautiful, the only annoying thing is people trying to reserve sun beds, no one is watching this and it was happening way too much, people would save beds and not be there for hours and come back and take their towels back..? Very frustrating for people looking for beds. I’m sure this happens anywhere you stay though. We had a balcony and this over looked the front carpark, still could chill on the balcony just not tonnes of sun on it. We had breakfast included and wow there was so much choice. Everyday we were so full and found going around 8-8.30 skipped the craziness of people, after 9 it can be a bit busy. The staff couldnt do more to be friendly and helpful and the food was amazing. We ate at both the burger bar and the restaurant that over looks the beach, both tasted amazing and were great value for money! Our room was very spacious, we were greeted with champagne on arrival to our room as we were celebrating a birthday which was so lovely. Even at 11pm on our arrival day they did this special little touch. We did have trouble with our safe as it ran out of space on the memory card and our stuff got locked inside, but instantly the reception team sent up security who were fantastic and sorted this out instantly. The private beach is honestly incredible...so quiet and beautiful. The free shuttle bus to old and new town is also a wonderful touch! Our only complaint is that the walls seem very thin we could hear next door and the hall way very clearly and on a couple of occasions did wake us up. Don’t let this put you off because honestly we couldn’t fault anything else, if you wanted you wouldn’t even have to leave the hotel, we didn’t for 2 days! The added touch of slippers and a robe is also very cute! The gym was great too and very good live music in the evenings, thank you for making our holiday perfect. Definitely would come back to stay here in a heart beat, absolutely amazing!"
Apr 2019,50,Recommended,"We very much liked our stay in Grande Real Eulalia Resort. We had one of the studios with kitchen, located outside of the main building. Service was excellent, room spacious and very nice. We barely used the hotel restaurants, which were all OK, but there are good choices close to the hotel as well where you can eat delicious fish...The kids club was really great for our son. The location is great, close to the beautiful beach."
Apr 2019,50,Amazing place best place I’ve been so far,"From the start of our trip tilll the end has been nothing but spectacular. This place is amazing, the food is fresh and delicious, literally everything about this place has had me in awe. The food, the beach, local attractions. Nothing but an amazing experience"
Apr 2019,40,Bit tired in some parts,Couldnt fault anything except some parts of the hotel looking a bit tired. All staff exceptional and very accommodating.  Breakfast was excellent  except for the bacon which was so hard you couldn't cut it. But there were so many other choices it didn't matter. I am still dreaming of the mini croissants. Even in France I've never had such good ones. We ate a few times in the hotel and everything was good.  The apartments were spacious and comfortable. Location was good. I'd definitely go back. Thanks to all the great staff.
Apr 2019,40,Another lovely stay,"This was our third stay at this hotel and since we first stayed it has in our opinion lost some of its sparkle and is beginning to look tired and in need of a freshen up. There are rumours that the hotel is being sold which would make sense as to why standards are slipping which is a shame as it could be beautiful. We were still happy with our week away, we treated ourselves to a suite but wouldn't bother with that again as you are in the shade quite early and with the winds it can be cold, however the jacuzzi bath was very nice. Good choice of food but if you are half board try a lunch instead of dinner as that is cooked to order rather than you having to queue at the buffet. All in all another lovely break in Portugal but we are tempted to book elsewhere next time."
Apr 2019,40,Great Location Great People,"We've just returned from 7 nights at this fab resort.  The people that work there really made our stay amazing, special shout out to the lade that cleaned our apartment 526 and the guy who puts the umbrellas out at the pool bar with the bow tie they were amazing kind people. The kids club was fantastic! I can't say enough good things about it great activities and movies. Location is fantastic can walk to a huge selection of restraunts and the stunning beach is on your doorstep. Apartments have everything you need and a a great size, they only downside was that's kids can not go in the indoor pool and because it rained for the first 3 days of our trip this was a bit if a downer."
Apr 2019,20,Poor Evening Buffet,We paid €60 for the evening buffet for 2 people .. it was of very poor quality.. there was a salad bar that had hardly any salad ! The choice of buffet food was very poor! I waited for my drink to arrive .. it finally arrived after I had finished my meal ! Not worth the money !
Apr 2019,40,Stay April 19,"This was our 5th visit to this hotel and we had a great 4 night holiday, brilliant hotel, staff and location. I would suggest the pool be heated and access to the spa pool on colder days.  Would be good to have fish/salmon available with the breakfast. If these small finishing touches could be arranged I would probably visit twice a year."
Apr 2019,50,Fantasic location,We've just stayed in the Grande Real for 11 night and were extremely impressed. Staff were so friendly and we requested room 127 which was a sea view suite and we got this room. The room was great for a family of 4. I will definitely be going back and recommend the hotel.
Apr 2019,50,Fantastic resort!!,"We came here for 5 days with the family! Found a great deal in April for Easter holidays.  Stayed in the 2 bedroom self catering apartment and added breakfast. Everything was great, great selection of fresh breakfast items. The beach is just there so perfect. We did some trips outside of resort too, visited old town for shopping and did the Algarve cave boat tour. Kids loved every minute of it all. Nice restaurants nearby as well and we took Uber everywhere. Highly recommend Grande Real Santa Eulália!! 😀🍹☀️"
Apr 2019,40,Lovely resort,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment for 5 days in April 2019. The apartment was excellent, 2 spacious bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a very nice kitchen/diner with balcony. The people in the resort were extremely helpful, pool was lovely although only one of the pools was heated and so the others were not used this time of year. The hotel has direct access to a very nice beach,  Would recommend self catering. The breakfast was just about worth it, but the lunch/dinner is not and getting an Uber cab into the old town for dinner is preferable.Overall, a lovely stay and would definitely consider coming back in the summer."
Apr 2019,40,Good Value for money beach resort,I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel.  The drinks in the lobby bar were quite expensive and the beds a little too hard.  Our room had a fantastic view of the beach with a large sunny balcony.  I would recommend this hotel for a relaxing break.
Apr 2019,50,Fabulous family resort,"Really nice resort for families with young kids. There is an all day kids club which runs many activities between 9-6, creative arts and craft etc. Age 3-12. Wonderful heated pool at the front of hotel. Perfectly warm in April even for the young kids. Direct access to a beautiful sandy beach. The beach really is perfect. Plenty of parking on site at the hotel too. At low tide you can take a nice walk to the next beach along the cliff side. The village Eulalia close by has lots of lovely shops and restaurants. The restaurants in the resort are slightly over priced and much better options lie within walking distance. The ATM at the resort charges 3.95euro each use. Yikes!!! There is a free ATM at Intermarché supermarket which is close by to the east of hotel."
Apr 2019,50,Absolutely Amazing,My first solo travelling experience and this was no doubt the best hotel I could have chosen. The staff were so friendly and helpful! They had loads of information on local tourist attractions and booked all my taxis for me. Absolutely loved it :)
Apr 2019,30,I expected more,"Positives point: location, reception, parking, kidness of the staffNegatives point: the sheets were never changed during the 6 day stay, thr barhroom was nit cleaned every day, the breakfast baco was inedible, too dry."
Apr 2019,40,4* not 5* but still a pleasant stay,"The hotel has gorgeous views of the sea and a lovely set of swimming pools outside. One is heated but was still too cold to use in the winter. The food is decent and the service is generally good, with smiling and friendly staff who clearly want to ensure the guests enjoy their time. My room was cleaned very well every day.  The wifi was excellent. I had a suite which was OK, but was essentially two rooms pushed together, one with a bed and one with a sofa, rather than a suite of rooms. The bathrooms have shower curtains, which is a pet peeve of mine, and the air conditioning didn't work particularly well. The 'king' beds are actually two single mattresses pushed together and a lot of the furniture doesn't feel like particularly good quality. My spa treatment was good and reasonably priced, but they charge around 20 euro to use the indoor thermal pools, where many of the jets were not working. In short it is a decent hotel in a beautiful location, but it's very much a mid-market leisure hotel rather than a luxury property - locations such as the Hilton Vilamoura far outweigh it. I have stayed in Grand Real hotels before, such as their Villa Italia in Cascais, which was incredibly, but the Satana Eulalia doesn't come close."
Apr 2019,50,another great stay,Knew what to expect from hotel and it didn't disappoint. Staff very well trained and service excellent. great location. Stayed bed and breakfast and there was plenty of choice. Restaurant staff very efficient in clearing up and very polite. Reception staff very helpful and approachable.
Apr 2019,50,Fabulous weekend stay with friends,"I stayed at this wonderful resort with four of my girl friends for a long weekend at the end of March.  We were very impressed with the customer service, cleanliness and hotel facilities in general. It was out of season so fairly quiet but nonetheless there was nothing to complain about. The rooms were spotlessly clean and quiet and we had the pool area to ourselves.  We didn't eat at the hotel apart from at the Atlantico restaurant which faced the beach and the food in there was very nice and reasonably priced.  The cocktails are to die for in the main bar of the hotel.  We visited the spa whilst we were there and you have to pay 3 euros for a swimming hat but that was also very nice and relaxing.  Everything you need is on your door step, you can walk to the new town/strip in 10 minutes and a taxi takes you to the old town in approx ten minutes.  Would highly recommend A Ruina restaurant in the old town which has wonderful views and you can choose your fish and seafood which they cook fresh on the grill. Would definitely return but perhaps when it's a little warmer."
Apr 2019,50,Wonderful stay.,We stayed in one of your one bedroom apartments for four weeks.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The resort has excellent facilities and is well located for all activities.  We have stayed here now three times and hope to return next year.
Apr 2019,30,nothing special,"my room was clean and had a reasonable size. but the blackout curtain did not prevent sunligth to get in. my room was facing the parking lot....breakfast was ok, but lactose free products weren't available and i needed to order 1 day in advance (!). at check out they asked me to pay more 100 and some euros more than the price i had in my booking, but they did correct ir after. but if i didn't remember or had complaint? how accurated should a 5 star hotel be? i did not liked as when they make mistakes they are the ones who always beneficts, not the client....."
Apr 2019,40,Great value for money,"spent a week in one of the houses,not main building.I Weloved the house.Especially the fully equipped kitchen.There is a nice supermarket nearby.Every morning we went there for fresh bread and groceries and then prepared breakfast ""at home"".Nice terrace also overlooking a quiet pool area.And Santa Eulalia beach itself is perfect.We went for HB although the food was a little tasteless.But outside the hotel I also could not find anything spectacular.Free shuttle to Albufeira several times a day.And the bus to Faro stops just outside the hotel.When looking around I thought I chose the best option by choosing this hotel.April is just a little cold,that was the only spoil.But heated pool outside"
Apr 2019,40,Very nice hotel wih nice beach!,"Very nice hotel with beautiful private beach (the big plus!) , breakfast ok but always exactely the same. Big rooms but we could hear our indian neighour every night so it was hard to sleep before they did!"
Apr 2019,50,Fabulous Hotel,Have stayed at this hotel 3 times now with different friends and family members each time and we have all thoroughly enjoyed our visits. Would return again and again. The rooms are very large and comfortable.Breakfast is exceptional.
Apr 2019,50,Wow!!!,"It was an amazing holiday in this hotel! First time in Portugal and the impression was the right one... From the rooms, to the service and the meal everything was very good! We would come back, cause it was a pleasant stay!"
Apr 2019,50,Portugal,"Third time at the Grand Real Santa Eulalia.  Love the hotel and stay there but the apartments where I stayed need a bit of freshening up, e.g. cracked kitchen counter, etc. Great water pressure.  The music in the lobby at night was unnecessary loud at times and card play or conversation was not easy."
Apr 2019,50,Lovely situated hotel,"When we booked this hotel, we did not expect such an impressing an nice building. The view from our balcony was extremely nice. And everybody was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was really nice and the evening buffet was Always extraordinary. We enjoyed our stay very much."
Apr 2019,50,Exclusiv Commodation,Absolutli top! Nice stay and big rooms. Very quiet. Verry good brekfast at the buffet. The service was verry kind and couteous. The room service was verry prompt and friendly. Nice strand restaurant with delices food. Fine beach.
Apr 2019,30,14 day stay in March 2019,"The overall staff members in each area are friendly, helpful and do their best to accommodate. Grounds - nice, but does need some updating in some areas.Beach - very nice, with fairly easy access by stairs. At low tide, you can walk quite far in both directions. ( CHECK tide charts first )Rooms ( we stayed in an apartment ) clean, decent amount of kitchenware, bed was very hard which made sleeping uncomfortable and the pillows were very small, good wifi service and tv cable service with 5-6 English channels. Housekeeping once a week. Two couches were comfortable.Buffet style restaurant - (we had included in our package breakfast and dinner here every day) large, clean eating area with outside patio. Large variety of food choices but our biggest disappointment was that most of the  food was always lukewarm to cold. Due to the location, there is a free hourly shuttle bus service to oldtown and newtown Albufeira, which we used quite a bit.  No laundry facilities onsite.Lounge entertainment 5 nights of the week."
Apr 2019,50,Great place for family,"All round very good especially for family The location, rooms, and services are all very good and would be happy to recommend to anyone wishing to visit this part of the country.Great for a five night stay in the room or apartment."
Apr 2019,10,NOT DOG FRIENDLY,"Visited their open air restaurant, for a snack,in a party of four adults (one wheelchair bound) and two very well groomed Shar Pei dogs. After struggling up a steep slope and short flight of steps, we were very quickly stopped ny a rather aloof restaurant employee who informed us that dogs are not allowed. Not wishing to make a fuss, and being a bit embarassed in front of the onlooking diners (many of whom were Dressed only in bathing suits), we politely made our way back down the very steep slope to the car park. It struck us that double standards are in play when an open air beachside restaurant, which welcomes people in bathing suits does not admit dogs. The wheelchair access is not great either. Quite disgraceful atually.On leaving the beach we went to another nearby restaurant, where the dogs were made very welcome,and even offered water with our drinks order. Now THAT IS class !"
Apr 2019,50,Lovely short break,"Stayed in one of the self catering apartments which was very spacious, colourful and clean, had all utensils that you needed (apart from washing up cloth and liquid). There are several pools on site each with their own bar, however due to time of year these weren’t open for us to use.  Super market was a short walk out to the right as you leave the the complex with a nice range of bars and restaurants a short walk to the left. Hotel runs a free shuttle service to both new and old town Albufeira serval times a day which comes in very handy if you fancy going out exploring. We had a very pleasant stay and would recommend this hotel for all ages. 😊"
Apr 2019,20,POOR  SPA  TREATMENT,"Recently returned from a trip to this hotel.  Have to say the weather was beautiful.  The hotel is well out from the new town and even further from the old town. The apartments were disappointing unclean and drafty.  The air conditioning was difficult to get right.  Shower over the bath was not warm and bath was very slippy.  They have a burger bar and burger and chips cost anything up to 19 euro. The spa was the most disappointing aspect of my trip.  I went for a sports massage costing 90 euro and for the price i was expecting a professional deep massage. Instead I got a very light touch massage and repeatedly had to request a deeper massage.  For the price and the reaction when I complained to the spa manageress and to the hotel, to say I was disappointed would be an understatement.   Better and cheaper massages in the New town.  Urban pizza is fantastic value and unbelievably good food with home made deserts. Farnels  steak house is also great value Sirloin Steak chips rice  onions and salad with choice of sauce costing 11 euro. The Clay Oven is and Indian  restaurant and the food there is amazing.  All these can be found in the New Town.   The hotel itself does a buffet style dinner but there is nothing special about this it is the same buffet dinners you get anywhere abroad. I would recommend the Parasio De Albuferia in the New Town.  Its location is great and within walking distance to everywhere.  Also recommend Mcdonnels pub,  lady from Derry works there and she is very efficient  friendly and great at her job.  Good drink and good crack."
Apr 2019,30,Great View... Needs Refurbishing,"The view was great and service was prompt and friendly. The hallways smelled musty as well as our first room. The hallway rugs were also dirty. We finally got a better room that wasn’t  too bad, but the furniture is old and dated. It felt like a cabin from the 1970s. The beach was amazing...as well as the breakfast buffet... that must be why they get 5 stars. I would rate it less than 3!"
Apr 2019,50,Superb!!,A stunning resort in a perfect location. Facilities and staff were second to none and the apartment was very clean and airy. We didn't need it but the kids club looked amazing.  Would definitely go back!
Apr 2019,40,Quick Three Day Visit,"Booked this hotel for a mini break as the price for bed and breakfast was good.(off season).Check in staff very friendly and efficient and spent plenty of time explaining all  about the hotels different restaurants, pools ect. The room was fine with twin beds and a kettle was in the room, I had requested a kettle before arrival. We had a partial sea view room with a balcony. The room needed a little T.L.C. The armchair had a rip in it.Breakfast was good with a good selection of fresh fruit. breads. egg station and the usual fry.The private beach is lovely and is like a cove,,lovely for a walk after breakfast.The hotel runs a shuttle bus to the old town and the new town which is handy.I would stay here again and am looking forward to another longer visit."
Mar 2019,50,Excellent Hotel,Just back from an extremely enjoyable stay at this fantastic hotel.  The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpfull and I cannot fault any aspect of the service and facilities.  Cant wait to  return for another stay and can fully recommend this hotel to any would be visitors.
Mar 2019,50,"Beautifully situated, elegant hotel, with excellent food and many facilities","The hotel is situated on the outskirts of Albufeira, with a free shuttle bus into town for those looking for Brit company and shopping opportunities. But staying in the hotel is a better alternative as its facilities are extensive - several swimming pools, spa, restaurants and bars of different sorts (with excellent service and really good food). This is a good base for exploring all over the Algarve, with Faro, Tavira, Loulé, Silves and many other places of interest within easy reach. For nature-lovers there are unusual birds and beautiful Mediterranean flowers to be discovered too. The hotel is suitable for families with children, single travellers and groups of friends. There are also conference facilities.Heartily recommended."
Mar 2019,50,Wonderful hotel,"The hotel was clean, attractive, had a variety of very good restaurants and patient, polite and well-informed staff. The pool and leisure facilities were first-class, and the gardens attractive and well-kept."
Mar 2019,50,Lovely stay,"Gorgeous hotel. Staff friendly. Rooms very comfy. Would come again in a heartbeat. Bar staff weren't all that quick with serving drinks, shame as it was out of season.Entertainment aimed at OAPs.Loved our stay."
Mar 2019,50,Good hotel right on the beach,Very friendly staff great service massive bed but a bit hard very clean not everything open as we went in March but would recommend this hotel 20 mins walk to strip 30 to old town free bus from hotel through the day but none after 6.30pm
Mar 2019,40,We got what we paid for,"We have visited this hotel many times since it opened for lunches/dinners and always loved the location and friendliness of the staff.   When we saw a really good deal for a stay in March with an option for a sea view room we thought it was almost too good to be true, even in low season!   Whilst we enjoyed the hotel very much, the only redeeming feature about the room was the wonderful view from the balcony.  The rooms are tired and in desperate need of refurbishment.  The furniture upholstery is sad and grubby.  Housekeeping also reflected the feeling of tiredness and was very hit and miss.  The Cozinha restaurant where breakfast is served is also in need of a refurb.   As with many buffet restaurants, chairs constantly screech across tiled floors.  Food selection is excellent, let down only by the ""hot"" breakfast offered lukewarm at best!   Very good, smiling staff, tables cleared and re laid very quickly .  Highly recommend both the service and the food at the Pergula ""Burger"" restaurant.Overall we enjoyed our stay but would rather pay a little more for better rooms.  Will definately return when the rooms are a 5 star hotel standard."
Mar 2019,50,Just wonderful,"If you see it book it loved everything service was amazing room couldn't be cleaner location was great and I can't wait to go back, looking to book our wedding great free shuttle service and free buggy ride round complex, thank you santa elulia for a memorable holiday and see you again soon :)"
Mar 2019,50,Our recent break,"We had a fantastic short break, the hotel was brilliant and all the staff were so helpful, friendly and efficient - highly recommended. The location was fantastic, right next to the beach, we will definitely be back"
Mar 2019,40,March getaway with friends,"The views from the resort are spectacular and overall we felt qute comfortable stayng at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort for a month with our friends.There were a few issues that should be addressed...the room we were offered was not fit to occupy. It had been heavily smoked in.  This is a non smoking resort, at least we thought. We were moved to another room that night and again to another the next day...tiring after a long journey from Canada.  Smoking is an issue at the resort...people were smoking in food areas outside which made it impossible to eat outside and to enjoy the pool areas.  There should be designated smoking areas outside not all over.Secondly, we asked every day for a clothes rack to do our laundry.  We watched as newcomers got theirs before giving us one.  It took 3 weeks before we got one forcing us to spend part of our vacation in a laundry outside of the resort.  Also we were only given 1 shower towel each for 7 days of use, we were there for a month...using a towell for 7 days is not healthy nor acceptable especially with no towel rack to air them in the sun.  We asked for more towels and were told no.  The apartment needs an update and I understand that is coming but in the meantime the sofa and drapes should be cleaned..quite simply, they smell.Apart from the above...the staff were pleasant, the shuttle service is great, the food we did eat at the resort was very good and we enjoyed the entertainment. The main lobby area is lovely and inviting.With a few adjustments the resort could be a grand place to stay in Albufeira.  It's unfortunate that we experienced these setbacks and hopefully all will be corrected."
Mar 2019,30,So relaxing,"Hotel staff and facilities were really good. Room was cleaned daily and nothing was too much trouble.Food on first night we had to wait over 45 minutes for a pizza, dough was a prepared frozen one so the delay baffles me. Especially since we were the only people in the restaurant? Thought €23 for one hour in indoor pool was absolutely ludicrous also"
Mar 2019,50,High quality experience.,Great hotel and facilities. Staff are very helpfull and friendly. Large complex consisting of hotel rooms and self catering flats. Great restaurants with beautiful views onto the ocean. A high class of service.
Mar 2019,50,Always an amazing holiday,"We return to this hotel every year since we got married there in 2015. Besides being such a special place for us to return this hotel is perfect in every way. Its location is excellent . The staff are so attentive and cant do enough for you. The views are beautiful. The pools , beach access ,kids club, spa ,staff,breakfast,the grounds and the shuttle service to and from the old town are just some of the great things about it . Too much to mention. We cant wait to return this may again . Would highly reccomend for familys or couples."
Mar 2019,40,Nice property but was lacking in regular maintenance of gardens and walkways,"We stayed at one of their apartments for 28 days mid February to mid March. The reception staff and other employees were polite friendly and always helpful. The main hotel was always immaculate and the views of the beach and ocean were spectacular . However, The apartment we stayed in was definitely not 5 stars in our opinion. Also the grounds were very poorly maintained: For example:paint was peeling on the fence beside the front gate; the gardens were often filled with weeds and we never saw any evidence of anyone doing any garden maintenance whatsoever while we were there; the steps leading up to our row of apartments had broken glass on one of the steps and this was never removed the whole time we stayed there; and a number of cobblestone walkways were in need of repair."
Mar 2019,50,Birthday weekend,Fantastic hotel. Booked a 5 day holiday with a friend for my birthday. Hotel is immaculate and apartment we had was really lovely. Staff very friendly and on the day before we leave knock at the door with a birthday cake and champagne for my birthday compliments from the hotel What a lovely surprise!! Would definitely return!!!
Mar 2019,50,Fabulous!,Absolutely fabulous resort!  We had a one bedroom apartment on ground floor with garden view and terrace. Wonderful huge king size bed and tv in bedroom as well as living room.  Wifi throughout. Excellent kitchen facilities.  Maid service every day with very thorough cleaning and fresh towels. Very friendly and attentive staff throughout the resort and all had very good English. Beautiful beach just a few minutes walk from hotel.  We had a swimming pool to ourselves which was just a few metres from our apartment and there are more pools up at the hotel.  Shuttle buses to the old town and new town run all day from the hotel although we got taxis as they were so cheap. All in all a wonderful relaxing resort with everything you need right on the doorstep.  We'll definitely be back!
Mar 2019,50,Brilliant Holiday,"Absolutely lovely hotel , would highly recommend, very quiet,and mostly was older people .Beach beautiful,with its own lovely restaurant ,pool area also lovely ,again very quiet,pool was very cold ,but a few did brave it . We stayed in the hotel with breakfast included,which had lots of variety ,always hot ,also enjoyed the procceco every morning .spa really modern,with great gym ,amazing massages too .About a 10 min walk to lots of bars and restaurants and a curtesy bus though out the day to the old and new town .we had a fantastic week ."
Mar 2019,50,Excellent Stay from the beginning.,"The staff is awesome, making the experience better with such sympathy.The apartment was clean and well equipped.The big plus for us was the location, just meters away from the beach. And ir you want to go to the swimming pool, even better.The kids club is also incredible good. Nice people and full of activities"
Mar 2019,40,A grate relaxing holiday,"Perfectly located and plenty of opportunities for nice quiet days.In general, the hotel seems a bit worn, especially some of the outdoor area. Our room was worn, and chairs on the balcony were bad.Lovely breakfast. The beach restaurant can be recommended, nice service and good food. We aimed to relax and have lazy days and we got it. Can be recomended."
Mar 2019,50,Great hotel!,Lovely hotel!  The appartment we had had everything we needed. Loved that the hotel was right on the beach.  Lovely atmosphere.  Staff were friendly and professional.  Pool area lovely and clean.  Would definitely return.  Had a great week.
Mar 2019,30,Only stop in Portugal,My bias upfront is having spent a month in various cities in Spain at 4 and 5 star resorts this one doesn’t quite compare. The rooms are however very clean and quaint with housekeeping staff and front desk all very kind and helpful. Manager very easy to deal with and sincere. A negative is the dated hallways (wildly bright/tacky carpeting would elevate with flooring). The main areas are bright and well done. The seaview room/suite is a view of the sea and while really pretty is not without obstacles - ours was over the swimming pools which are noisy and others are over roof tops. The pics in the brochure a little misleading. The beach is many steps/ramps down from the hotel (all hotels in this area I suspect are the same).  So if you want seaside in the strictest sense this area not it. The hotel does provide a free shuttle to the restaurant part of town and the ‘old town’ which is otherwise about a $5E cab ride or hour long walk. However with the exception of a handful of shops they are selling dollar store quality goods at high prices considering most stuff is from South America and China. Very little comes from Portugal in this place. We are as I said biased because Spain was so hospitable and we found the prices in the tourist towns (Costa Del So) and Barcelona so much better with more authentic goods. AND we have not explored what I’m sure is a beautiful country in other areas less touristy. The ocean at the resort and along the coast is spectacular. Just not easy to get to.Re the pictures: hallway carpet and view of ocean from the camera taken at doorway of hotel room and view taken at the railing of room balcony.
Mar 2019,50,Fantastic Hotel Outstanding Value,"This hotel is highly recommended for outstanding quality, value and location.We were given a very warm welcome by the concierge Jerome Fernandez.We had booked a standard double sea view room but were rewarded an upgrade to a double room double bathroom and twin balcony suite 127.Room was fantastic with a huge 7' bed!We were on half board basis and given 7 meal vouchers to be exchanged for lunch or evening meal. This gave great flexibility of meal options.I highly recommend using the vouchers at lunch time which is a la cartè. The food at lunch was truly outstanding quality.The evening meal is buffet style and still excellent choice and quality but given a choice I would take a la cartè ever day.The hotel is in a great location with a short walk out of the back to a lovely sandy beach.Out of the gates left and a fifteen minute walk to the bars and restaurants of Santa Eulalia. Turn right and a few restaurants and a supermarket within ten minutes and a 9 hole golf complex at La Baia.The hotel has a number of well appointed bar and lounge areas and a Spa to relax in.We had a fantastic holiday made all the better by the attention to detail and support of the concierge Jerome.This was exemplified by the fact we were departing very early on our final day Jerome went that extra mile and arranged (free of charge) room service for breakfast before our departure.Well done Grande Real Santa Eulalia management and special thanks to Jerome Fernandez."
Mar 2019,50,"Peaceful location, very friendly service, amazing fitness classes and gym.","The highlight of my stay was making use of the gym and the free exercise classes, really great instructors who will push you to work hard but in a fun way. Also took advantage of a free Portuguese lesson on the first day which really helped with the basics and gave me some confidence to make some effort to not just default to English the whole time. Every member of staff I encountered was super friendly which made me feel very at home here.I stayed here for a week in one of the self catering apartments. I had booked a studio but they kindly upgraded me which meant I got a separate bedroom instead of just one open plan room. The apartment was very comfortable and clean, lots of space and the housekeeping staff did an amazing job of cleaning / tidying. The kitchen is basic but I managed to cook decent meals, plenty of pots and pans. I would recommend taking your own knife though if you plan on doing much chopping. The beach is glorious and you can get a decent cheap meal from the bar overlooking it.I loved it so much I am returning after a week !"
Mar 2019,50,This is now my favourite Albufeira Hotel by far,"Beautiful 5 star hotel with facilities to match. Staff very attentive at all levels. Food to die for, with variety every meal, plenty of it and delicously presented and flavoursome. The chef certainly knows how to cook! Large lounges and ample sunbeds in the veranda areas and around pools. Heated outdoors pool for March was a bonus. Bedrooms very well appointed too. East transport to centre of town extra- highly recommended."
Mar 2019,50,Great Place,"Our second visit here, and enjoying it even more. The self catering apartments are really big,colourful and very clean and comfortable. Everything is supplied, and our apartment had a tv in the living room and the bedroom. Great staff. Looking forward to a return to this beautiful place"
Mar 2019,50,Week in the sun,"Really lovely hotel just outside the new town. Very easy walk to the new town and a lovely longer walk to the beautiful old town. This hotel has brilliant amenities, the beach is spectacular, the rooms are lovely, clean, with very comfy beds. Had 1 night were our neighbours were very loud and had a bit of a party, the hotel sorted it immediately. Would recommend it for families and couples looking a relaxing break"
Mar 2019,40,Almost perfect holiday ........,Excellent 5* hotel in a lovely location adjacent to beautiful beach. Friendly and professional staff. We stayed in a 3rd floor sea view room that had an amazing view of the sea/beach.  Our only issue was with the food in the main restaurant that was served buffet style that we found to be not hot enough. Almost a perfect holiday
Mar 2019,40,Grand enough for the money,"A five-star hotel which needs a lick of paint in the bedrooms. We believe maintenance of the tlc sort is on hold because the property is being sold. However, the silver lining is that prices are very keen. Service is good too, as is the food."
Mar 2019,40,Great Hotel with good food and Lovely Views,"Lovely hotel with a free courtesy bus to take you to/from new and old towns during the day only. Easy check in with friendly helpful staff. Bedroom was large, clean and had air conditioning (we paid extra for the sea view, which was worth it). Great breakfast each morning which you could have in the dining room or take outside to the patio area to enjoy. There is a nice lounge area to relax in over coffee or to have a drink in the evening and a classy Burger restaurant too if you wanted a snack in the evening. Not all restaurant/bars areas were opened in March but plenty open for the guests there at that time of year...Though an ice cream vendor by the pools would have been nice to have during the day.  A card was given on arrival to receive towels daily to use by the pools. We had a lovely stay, with good value for money."
Mar 2019,30,Decent stay with some hiccups,"Its a good location with a  beautiful beach behind the hotel. My kids enjoyed going to the beach everyday. The restaurant at the private beach is very good. However, the restuarant within the hotel was very average.We had chosen apartment with self catering. Most of the time, we cooked ourselves. Only on few occasions, we ate there at hotel, but these werent impressive.Breakfast isnt that very standard. Christmas dinner was really ok, too overcrowded within the space.  Within a mile, you could walk to stores to get supermarket items for cooking. Kitchen istn that big. We had to buy pans in nearby store as the vessels kept within apartment were more like porcelain dishes.  The rooms were very cold as central heating doesnt work that well inside bedrooms whereas the living rooms were quite warm. We stayed in Winter. Thankfully, Housekeeping  provided with extra heater as the bedroom was awfully cold. Approaching the reception was a bit uncomfortable as they werent much helpful many times. Spa was good. There is Lot of space to walk around, get sunshine, at the lounge and abclnies facing the beach. View towards the beach is awaesome. There are small outdoor pools which are free. Indoor pool is linked with spa and needs payment. Overall, stay was ok.. with small hiccups, which were manageable."
Mar 2019,50,great hotel,super beach lovely pools  very clean and and very helpful staff  it has private beach hotel has its own coach that takes you to the strip or to the old town and arranged pick up times we will return again
Mar 2019,40,"Good 3 night break, excellent sea view at breakfast and swimming pool. Spacious and clean rooms","Stayed in March 2019, excellent sea view at breakfast and from swimming pool area. Hotels are clean and spacious. Only did bed and breakfast, other meals around between 20 and 30 euros per person which is on the expensive side, soft drinks are about 3 and beer starts at 4 euros. They have a free shuttle bus to new town and old town regularly every day which we used as the food and drink prices are cheaper outside of the resort. Did not use the spa as expensive to use a indoor warm pool for 20 euros. Best  thing about this hotel was the sea view."
Mar 2019,40,Very large resort,A spacious and grand resort but not very Portuguese.  You could be anywhere in North America.  Food and services are first class but there is little atmosphere of Europe.  You have to walk far from the various apartments to the main resort.  Food is bland and North American. Why bother coming when there are other resorts that make you feel like you are in Portugal.
Mar 2019,50,Fantastic hotel,"Wonderful hotel, great facilities and great staff who are extremely helpful. Breakfast is excellent. Shuttle bus runs to  and from the old town multiple times each day. Would highly recommend this hotel."
Mar 2019,40,Weekend break,"Stayed here for the weekend as a birthday treat for my partner. The hotel is beautifully appointed, clean and friendly. The room was tidy and the extra large bed a real treat.The only two things I could say would improve the hotel and stay would be to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room, I was disappointed I could not have a cup of tea first thing in the morning. The other issue was the scraping chairs in the dining room, I suggest the management look at spending some money investing in attaching ' pads' on the bottom of the chairs! It makes for a very unpleasant dining experience in the main restaurant. The acoustics in the main dining room are very disconcerting - particularly if one has hearing problems,  I could hear the conversations of diners sitting a long way away but I couldn't hear my partner's voice sitting opposite me! The other problem with the dining room is that the tables are very close together and it felt overcrowded. I think in the high season that would be a real issue."
Mar 2019,50,5* accom 0* entertainment,Hotel was spot on very welcoming staff Good prices aswell not to pricey However the entertainment on a night was absolute dire i think kareeoke would have been a better option than your local piss poor gutairist
Mar 2019,50,Lovely hotel with excellent facilities next to beautiful beach,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Our room had a beautiful view overlooking the beach and was clean and comfortable. The breakfast selection and quality were excellent and was worth getting up for. Staff were attentive and really friendly. The shuttle to and from the old town is such a good idea and made our choice to stay at this hotel so much easier. The hop on hop off bus also has a stop in the Santa Eulalia area close to hotel. There are a great variety of places to eat and drink at the resort and quality and service were all excellent. I loved the easy access to the beach, the small shop (selling snacks, water to beach accessories) and the snack bar overlooking the beautiful beach front. The musicians in the lobby each evening were brilliant  (we were really impressed by the standard) and it was a great way to relax and unwind with drinks. There are plenty of lovely restaurants within easy walking distance from the resort too. I would recommend this hotel and would love to stay here again."
Mar 2019,40,"Lovely Location, some things could be better...","First impressions when we arrived were that this hotel was in a lovely location with easy access to a picture perfect beach. Our room was also very nice and spacious and the reception staff were all friendly and helpful.There are a few things which could have made a pleasant stay wonderful. The room had no tea and coffee making facility. We found this odd and thought perhaps hot drinks were available at no cost elsewhere in the hotel, but unfortunately not. In a five star hotel you would expect some complimentary drinks with the room. The second issue we had was with the breakfast. All the usual options were available but we found the cooked breakfast foods (egg, sausage etc) seemed to lack seasoning; the cereals were stale; and the pancakes were a flop. Worst of all, the coffee came from a self-service machine which was just not good enough. I would however like to give special mention to the pastry chefs, as every morning there was a wide variety of wonderful pastries.Lastly, we were disappointed to find that the indoor pool was chargeable. Especially since the outdoor pools were a little to fresh to swim in during March. All in all, I'd say the hotel is very pleasant but could be so much more if the points above were improved upon."
Mar 2019,50,Good resort,"Really nice and relaxing resort, especially for a small family. There are plenty of activities to do and places to visit around.Being off season (Early March) only one swimming pool was heated, which is understandable but that also meant your options are limited.All in all, a great resort, will definitely come back again."
Mar 2019,50,What an amazing hotel!,"There’s so much I can say about Grande Real Santa Eulália, it is better then what it looks like in pictures. This hotel is beautiful and the staff are so helpful so kind and so well mannered. I visited with me husband, son who was 18months my two sisters and brother we honestly had the best stay. We had a studio and an apparement with pool and garden view and was the view lovely we loved loved loved it! The beach was a minute walk from the hotel the views was breath taking. Our week went by soo fast we all was very sad to leave if it wasn’t for work commitment we would of extend our stay. We only had breakfast at the hotel and the variety my god was so good we enjoyed the breakfast! The rooms was cleaned everyday the only thing was they didn’t change our bedding everyday or gave clean towels everyday but they did do a good job cleaning the rooms. The staff was ever so friendly and thank god they all spoke good English. We will definitely be visiting again in the future. I can’t recomned this hotel enough!! Before I went I read loads of reviews I did read the negative ones and was a little worried but I trust me there is nothing to be worried about. Thank you all at Geand Real Santa Eulália!"
Mar 2019,50,Beautiful Place,"Wrong time of year but the Hotel was fabulous. Staff were extremely friendly, hotel was spotlessly clean, food was brilliant. the beach below  the hotel was beautiful, the bus service into town was brilliant. Driving around the location was easy. Most definitely come back again."
Mar 2019,40,Holiday,Hôtel of very high report quality on winter.Réception very good.  Breakfast good but no réal orange juice. Swinming pool very bad. Seaview perfect.  Large Space inside the hôtel. Situation very good. Climatisation not well functioning.
Mar 2019,40,Great stay!,"Great staff and beach views. The staff put a lovely birthday surprise for my mum, which was greatly appreciated! The only faults I had were the room was dated and the pool by us was not heated, we were the only ones to brave it.Over all it was one of the best places I've stayed"
Mar 2019,50,Very very good hotel! We spent here a honeymoon) special thanks to the manager Jerome for help to make a surprise),"Very very good hotel! We spent here a honeymoon) special big thanks to the manager Jerome for help me to make a surprise for my husband, then I ask him to help me month ago from Moscow) we will really enjoy this hotel at all!"
Mar 2019,50,Berry four day break,"Hotel has an excellent position overlooking beach with gorgeous view of beach and sea as we sat and ate our breakfast on the restaursnt veranda. We were B and  B and the buffet style breakfast presented lots of options, with enough for all. Albufiera is about 40 mins walk away but hotel have free shuttle, where there are numerous restaurants, and a number alsi  closer to the hotel.Room very clean. Bed a tad hard. Other than lacking tea and coffee facilities in the room, the hotel was excellent value for money and clean throughout. Staff were very helpful and polite and did everything possible to assist  in making our stay Relaxing and enjoyable.Have already recommended to family and plan to return later in the year."
Mar 2019,40,"February13-march13, 2019","The property was lovely.  The staff were polite and generally helpful.  We generally found the food a little pricey.  We were disappointed in the wifi service cutting out frequently.  As well, I asked for an umbrella for my patio outside our apartment.  We had not side panel and our deck was fully exposed.   I was told yes, we will bring you one.  We enjoy sitting outside but our deck was very sunny with no shade. Not everyone wants to TAN.  After 24 hours, I called again in regards to the umbrella, and I was told no, that there are no umbrellas for the apartments.  Disappointing!  So we could not enjoy our patio area.  And we were there for a month."
Mar 2019,40,John & Karen,Overall was satisfactory. Cooking facilities inadequate as no oven.  Needs a proper stove and better and less expensive laundry facilities. Fan in bathroom did not work but was not aware until final three days. Umbrellas should be provided for balconies without an overhead covering.  Did not eat in the resorts restaurants as too expensive versus what was available locally.
Mar 2019,50,Excellent hotel with a beautiful view,We had a studio-apartment for 2 people. It was quiet and off season. We loved it. Everything was very clean and the staff was very kind. The view is spectacular. There was a salsa event in the weekend but it was fun and did not disturb our vacation.
Mar 2019,40,Spring Leisure Break,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Breakfast was excellent however we only eat dinner once in the main restaurant, the buffet was expensive and choice extremely limited. It certainly was not up to the standard we have experienced at other establishment, in Portugal and Spain, consequently we choose to eat out. Bar prices are quite expensive and a further encouragement to move out and explore other establishments."
Mar 2019,50,Superb holiday accomodation,Enjoyable stay in superb setting with excellent facilities and attentive friendly staff .who helped us to make the most of our short break.The hotel adjoins an excellent  beach with access to their own cafe providing an extensive selection of drinks and meals.
Mar 2019,40,Very enjoyable stay,"Great location, sea view room with fantastic view and lovely beach.Couple of negatives, rooms could do with a bit of an upgrade, buffet dinner quite expensive, drinks very expensive, beds really hard, steps to the beach could do with some maintenance.Notwithstanding this the positives outweigh any negatives. Staff were lovely, location, views and beach fantastic, free shuttle bus for old town and new town really useful. All in in all we had a great holiday here"
Mar 2019,50,Missing accessibility,"I use a power wheelchair. This hotel is beautiful, It has a clean accessible beach. We had a long stay holiday. We stayed in an apartment which was fairly accessible but the shower was not accessible. 28 days without a shower wasn't good. If a shower bench had been provided it would have been better. The grab bars are not easily used. The therapeutic pool does not have a lift to get in and out this proved to be a huge disappointment. The staff are friendly,& extremely helpful."
Mar 2019,50,It really is 5*,"Stayed here recently as a girls holiday in a group of 6 people, 2 people to a studio apartment for two nights. I’ll be honest, having travelled quite a bit around Europe I’ve become accustomed to their star rating not being equivalent to the same star rating as I would be used to in the UK. Therefore I wasn’t overly excited about this being a 5* hotel as I expected it to be closer to a 3* hotel standard. I was wrong! After prebooking transport, a private 8seater, through Travel Republic (£17pp return) it was a short 30minute drive until we arrived at the hotel from Faro airport. The hotel is a short 5minute taxi ride from new town (€5). I had friends who were staying in old town who said it was a €5 taxi ride from old town to new town so I’m guessing about €10 taxi ride from our hotel to old town but we only ever went to old town during the day and we used the complimentary hotel shuttle to do so- regular times, plenty of seats and you just catch it at the main doors. There is an area of shops and restaurants a short 10-15 minute walk from the hotel if you need to buy any food, water, alcohol etc. Just walk out the main entrance gates of the hotel and turn left.Check in (and check out) were both done by Ruben who was friendly, helpful, efficient and genuine, providing all necessary information and instantly making us feel welcome. Although we arrived at 11am one of our three studio apartments was available to check into already so we got driven to our room on these little golf buggy things (it was only a short 5minute walk to our room but it was a nice touch, and some areas of the resort would need the drive as it is massive!). Within the hour our other two apartments were ready as well. At the time of booking I had asked for the rooms to be beside each other if possible,and although we weren’t beside each other we were put very close to each other which I appreciated. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the studio apartments,really spacious and equipped with everything you could possibly need- fridge, hob, kettle, microwave, bottle of water and lots of complimentary toiletries. We had a balcony which looked over greenery and caught the sun for most of the day. Two single beds pushed together to form one massive double and a sofa bed as well. Plugs at the bedside. Good strong free WiFi. Negatives? The only full length mirror is in the darkest part of the apartment, by the door. A brighter light here would be ideal. And although everything else seemed very clean, the floor was not! Your feet was black in seconds. After check in we explored the resort, as mentioned above it is a massive area! There are three separate pool areas, two by the apartments- one pool to each area and both of these pools cold and nobody about them when we were there (out of season), the third pool area is at the main hotel area (if you go down the main stairs in the reception foyer you can’t miss them), there are two pools here, one cold and one heated. This pool area was the only one that was at all busy in our time there. You get a card which you exchange for fresh pool towels as you wish. There are several restaurants but tbh I can only comment on the snack bar down by the beach as this is the only one we used. There is a burger restaurant and a fancier restaurant I believe and a lobby bar. The snack bar is in a beautiful location overlooking the hotels private beach but catches the wind so if you’re there out of peak season I would bring a light jacket (you’ll definitely need it at nighttime!), it was anywhere between 18-22 degrees when we were there but it felt cooler with the wind. We were all a little disappointed with the food in the snack bar to be honest, I tried the lasagna which was just tasteless sauce and I had a ham and cheese toastie which had so much butter on it that’s all I could taste! My friends had the banana milkshake which they didn’t like, but my fruit smoothie was refreshing and the icecream was beautiful!! Word of warning- the main areas to walk are mainly cobbled as is the case in old and new town as well, so flats or wedge type heels are recommended. The beach is exclusive to the hotel and is beautiful, very clean, soft sand and when we were there very quiet. It’s your own little area of paradise. I was told there is beach sports available from April to October such as jet skiiing, banana boating etc. There are some areas of the hotel that were closed when we were there as it’s out of season but I imagine these are all open during the summer months. Most staff encountered were friendly and very good at their job. Reception would book taxis for us at our request. On our last night we were told we had to check out at 10am from the apartments but to ring in the morning and see if we could get late check out, when I did we were very lucky that one of our studio apartments were able to have late check out (to noon) so we stored our luggage here until noon,at which stage we were able to store our luggage behind reception, their storage room was full but the bags were behind a barrier so secure enough. The rate we got for our stay was incredibly good value for money and all of us left with the intention of coming back in the near future!"
Mar 2019,50,Fantastic hotel,"We stayed in one of the apartments and it was lovely. Spacious, well laid out, lovely terrace and everything needed for a relaxing holiday.  The facilities at the hotel are excellent and all the staff go the extra mile to ensure your stay is perfect.  Housekeeping is exceptional."
Mar 2019,50,Lovely stay and great hospitality,"Lovely stay At this lovely Resort & Hotel. Me and my partner enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff and concierge were very helpful and friendly- particularly Pedro at the front desk, offering us complimentary drinks as a surprise for our birthday celebrations. We would definitely be back! Close to the beach - about 5min walk and different pools to access. Breakfast was delicious with so much to choose from.The rooms were very spacious and replenishment was almost constant. Many restaurants along the pier serving excellent food and drinks. Loved it *****"
Mar 2019,40,lovely place !,"This is a lovely location with its beach. Rooms are spacious with suites having 2 toilets which is always lovely when you are staying with others.  One star less as restaurants' buffet was not great (not tasty) and no coffee or tea facilities in the suite ! Minibar/fridge was not equipped at all. No water. However, breakfast was great for the money and waiter service was fab!"
Mar 2019,50,Beautiful view!,We stayed for 3 nights in the beginning of March and are very pleased with the hotel and staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The weather was also very good and around 25° everyday. Local shops and bars a walking distance and a free bus from the hotel to the new and old town which was worth visiting. We would definitely recommend.
Mar 2019,50,A true gem,"The location of this hotel is stunning, a beautiful beach on your doorstep and other equally glorious beaches within easy walking distance.  Rooms, food and facilities were excellent, very large bed which was one of the most comfortable we've experienced, robes, towels and even beach towels were of superb quality.    The staff were friendly and helpful, nothing too much trouble.   Not too much evening entertainment or daytime activities which I presume was due to the time of year but since we were in a suite that was not a problem, English channels on TV."
Mar 2019,50,Highly recomended,"We stayed here for a week in March staying in the one bedroom apartments with the bright decor on a self catering basis.  The hotel complex is large and well located and the rooms were well equipped with everything that you need. This is a very nice hotel complex with the staff giving a 5* feel, but the general condition of the site is no higher than 4* due to numerous maintenance issues when exploring. Silly things like the condition of the decking areas, numerous tiles missing in the pools and run down areas on route to the beach.  I would also like to see more information in the rooms regarding the amenities and their location within the site, maybe a location map or sign posts. This complex is probably 15 years old and i would say is as built. All that said it is still a fantastic place to stay and would recommend it to anyone."
Mar 2019,40,Friendly and good location,Friendly staff and great location. Cleaningservice perfect! The apartments in need of refreshing and a renovating update. Wi-Fi works good in the lobby but really bad connection in the apartment if it's located a bit far from the actual hotel.
Mar 2019,40,Wonderful area - nice apartment,We stayed at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia for four weeks in a one bedroom apartment. The area is wonderful. Restaurants and grocery shopping in easy walking distance. The hotel also operates a shuttle into Albufeira four times daily which we used frequently. Our apartment was comfortable - it wasn't particularly clean when we arrived - the floors were quite dirty but after the first cleaning it wasn't as bad. The only negative thing was all the apartments have chairs that drag across the tiles and are quite noisy. We knew when our neighbours were up. Also the drawers in the closet were noisy. Overall it was an enjoyable stay.
Mar 2019,30,Here for 2 months Feb & March,We chose this 1 bedroom apartment to get away from the Canadian winter. To date the service is excellent and the apartment has just about everything you need. The decoration is a matter of choice.  It would be nice if the pool outside the apartments was heated - there is one on the hotel side. All the pools' deckings and steps to the beach need repairing. The weekly housekeeping is very good. We appreciate the daily shuttle to Old & New town Albufeira. There is plenty of outdoor and underground parking.Ladies: leave your heels at home. There is cobblestones sidewalks and some roads everywhere. Also to consider is that this part of country is quite hilly.We look forward to enjoying the sunshine and seaview for the rest of our stay.
Mar 2019,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia,Great resort vacation! Travelled with large contingent of Canadians. Wonderful service. Beautiful on-site beach. Walk or take hotel shuttle to Albufeira. Loved the entertainment. Best hotel in the area.
Mar 2019,50,My favorite place in Albufeira!!,This is the second time I have stayed at this beautiful complex First time self Catering this time B&B. The staff are wonderful and cant do enough for you. The food delicious and breakfast buffet you cant beat for choice. The beach bar service also wonderful and food excellent.  I would go back here in a heartbeat. Its a gem not to be passed by!! The staff are a delight and nothing is too much trouble.
Mar 2019,50,Very good stay,"Very nice room. Nice view of gardens with partial sea view. Breakfast was good. Flexi check-out. Just couple mins walk to the beach. Beach is amazing even in off peak season. Minor point,  The plug points were only placed away from the bedside lamps. There were no points near the bedside. Overall though a very good stay and we would definitely come back again."
Mar 2019,50,Portuguese Paradise,"Very enjoyable stay as a family with 2 small children. Very clean, comfortable rooms. Staff very friendly. Beautiful resort, beautiful beach. Only one heated pool and no heated children's pool, this was the only downside, but thanks to the perfection of everything else, we had a great holiday. The food was excellent, too - regional, interesting and fresh."
Mar 2019,50,"Great hotel, amazing location","Great hotel on the beach, amazing location. Very good facilities. The children were so happy at the kids club. It was our second year at the hotel and we’ll definitely go back in the future. We had a great time."
Mar 2019,50,PERFECT,"Booked this hotel for a mini break with my family and it’s absolutely beautiful! Spacious rooms , comfortable beds, and really friendly staff! Rooms get cleaned every day, with fresh towels and freshly made beds! Great value for money!!! Love the pool area and right on the beach too! Absolutely beautiful breathtaking views !!! Food at the bar is amazing, great atmosphere and great live music at night time! So chilled and relaxing!!! Loved everything about the hotel! Also awesome gym facilities, didn’t get to use the spa but looks great!! Free regular buses to old and new town!! Love the security of the hotel too makes you feel safe...Absolutely love this hotel! We will definitely be back ten out of ten!!!"
Mar 2019,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia,"We went to Albufeira for midterm break with the kids. Very happy we stayed in Grande real Santa Eulalia. We were in the resort suite and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff are very professional,kind and family friendly. Loved the food from the restaurant and the variety of food for breakfast. Our stay was excellent."
Feb 2019,50,Returned for a 5th time,"We love coming here during Feb half term, weather has been kind always returning with a bit of a tan. Kids love the heated outdoor pool and we enjoy sitting outside the cafe overlooking the beach, wonderfully relaxing. Hotel staff are the best. We stayed in an apartment which are fine, just a tad outdated but this won't stop us returning next year hence why rating if 4 for rooms"
Feb 2019,40,Holiday in Santa Eulalia,"We had a nice stay in this wonderful location.We love it, the hotel , portugal and the weather in february.The fresh fruits every day during  berakfast - wonderfulWe come since some years and will com ethe next years."
Feb 2019,50,"Excellent hotel service, location and food","We loved our stay. Excellent service, kindness, friendly staff. We were 2 Adult and 2 child and had plenty of things to do in the hotel and sorrounding area. We would come back to the same hotel if opportunity arrives."
Feb 2019,40,Top trip for toddlers!,"Excellent location, *really* great, friendly and interactive staff and overall facilities/amenities. However the hotels policy on food ""to go"" left us feeling a little short changed.For those with half/full board lunch/dinner vouchers; food CANNOT be taken to your room. We tried, offering to pay full room service charge, on nights where our LO wasn't feeling well but were refused. We missed 2 x prepaid dinners because of this policy. The vouchers were not refunded nor could they be transferred to other guests for use.This is something that would need to be redressed before we'd return."
Feb 2019,40,Quiet time.,"Massive suite, great views over beach.Great breakfast Gym small but functional February is quiet but the whole albufiera is quiet at this time.Room service was exceptional( Pizza so good we had it twice)Atlantico bar on the beach was relaxing."
Feb 2019,50,Superb beach side break,"Excellent short break. Impressive public areas, large comfortable bedroom, perfect location with direct access to a beautiful beach, great quality breakfast with lots of choice. Great service throughout. Would return without hesitation."
Feb 2019,50,Fabulous holiday,"This is a regular holiday for us now, every February. The staff are always extremely helpful and friendly, the hotel is lovely with the rooms being extremely clean and comfortable. We always book for breakfast as the choice and quality of the food is always superb and really sets us up for the day.I cannot recommend this hotel and staff highly enough, nothing is ever too much trouble."
Feb 2019,40,Short February Break,"We spent three nights at this lovely hotel during the February half-term.  As our stay was during the low season, our review is based on our ‘off peak’ experience.  Check-in was quick and uneventful - we were in our suite within minutes.  Ocean View The SuiteThe  bedroom was perfectly adequate with a genuine king size bed - not the two single beds joined together you find in some similar European hotels. There is a functional (albeit empty) minibar. It was lovely to have a small private balcony with a table and chairs from which to enjoy the sea view. The living area has a sofa bed as well as a small dining table and its own furnished balcony with ocean and pool views. The BathroomThere are two, yes two fully equipped bathrooms with full-size baths. This is really convenient for families or friends sharing a suite especially as the living area has its own storage and tv.  Perhaps the inclusion of its own minibar would make it complete.Breakfast and DinnerWe stayed on an half-board basis which for the most part was ok. Breakfast was adequate with sufficient choices of hot and cold food as well as fruits.  Dinner was less successful as only one buffet restaurant was included. Depending on your dietary preferences, you may be left feeling a little bit short changed with the offerings. A small glass of orange juice will set you back €4 - which if you’re dining as a family will add up.General overviewOverall, we scored the property a four as though it was clean, there were definite signs that it is showing its age and in need of a general renovation.  While we could appreciate that the decorative theme was in keeping with the sea side location, it perhaps wasn’t the best choice to use blue and white carpets in the corridors as there were obvious stains which detracted from the ambience. Notwithstanding the above, we would recommend this hotel for its convenience, staff, and easy access to the beach. We would certainly return in the off peak season."
Feb 2019,50,Great value off-season break,Being regular guests we can highly recommend the Grande Real Santa Eulália. The one bedroom apartments provide plenty of space for our family of 5. Every possible amenity is available on site including direct beach access. There are a few trip-advisor grumbles about paying extra for the spa but this is not unusual in our experience. Very much looking forward to our next visit!
Feb 2019,40,February Half Term Break,"Arriving at the hotel and check in was smooth. I chose the apartment which was very spacious and clean with daily cleaning. The bed was awesome.... The breakfast was not bad but the lunch A La Carte was so lovely. I booked half board ( breakfast and dinner) but the good thing was that you could swap your voucher for lunch, the dinner wasn't that fantastic to be honest. As per the kids club, it was fab my girls loved it and they are 9 and 7 yrs respectively. There are several outdoor swimming but one of them is heated. The hotel is situated right across the beach which was lovely. A supermarket is just about 5mins work from the hotel.Albufeira is such a lovely and peaceful destination for holiday. You cant go wrong coming on vacation to Grande Real."
Feb 2019,20,Disappointed .... not a great experience for us.,"I was not sure whether to award 3/5 or 2/5 but our experience at the end of the stay meant it had unfortunately had to be the latter. We are regular visitors to this part of the Algarve usually staying at a neighbouring property but this time we visited with a number of friends and their families who wanted a bit of luxury as there were a couple of recent birthdays and the reviews seemed very good.Our trip started quite well with a nice touch of each of our rooms being given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and we were allocated next to each other. However our 'sea view' booked rooms were actually side sea view rooms. The rooms themselves were a good size and are nicely furnished .... however we were joined by a good number of ants during our 3 night stay. There was a useful fridge and a kettle was supplied upon request but there was no complimentary tea or coffee. We struggled to control the air conditioning and so our room also became very warm at night which meant it was quite uncomfortable at times although the beds themselves were comfortable.The staff we met were very pleasant at reception, at the bar and for the most part at breakfast. However the lady who was cleaning our room couldn't raise a smile or return a greeting.Facilities - 20 euros for an hour to use the spa pool ... the only indoor heated pool at the hotel in Winter ..... is just wrong. If it had been for the full day it would have been expensive but more understandable. We were just not prepared to pay this and being quite cold outside in meant we were not prepared for the young children to venture into the heated outdoor pool in case they got a chill. Indeed there was very little in the hotel to keep children over I would say 4 years of age entertained. i.e. no corner with say a games console, I did not notice any table tennis or board games etc.On the day we left for home we had an early morning flight home which meant we would have to leave at the time the restaurant was open for breakfast at 7am. Given that we had paid for breakfast in the room rate my wife thought it should be possible to get some danish pastries and a takeaway drink to have in the car on the way to the airport. When she went to ask she was bluntly told that it was 'hotel policy' not to allow food to be taken out of the restaurant and so we had to leave without any breakfast of any sort. Breakfast on the other 2 mornings was very good and plentiful.Knowing what else is available in the area we would not return ourselves. A good quality 4 star often seems a better choice than a limited 5 star facility."
Feb 2019,50,Had a perfect time albeit not too many kids in the off season!,We got an amazing deal here and got very lucky with the weather. Not too many kids for our 2 year old but it was during school term so that's to be expected. As a result the kids club was pretty empty at times but the staff were great and more kids did come along.Loved the hotel. Great location. Amazing time!
Feb 2019,50,Take a chance and book Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa. You won't regret it !,"As always the staff at Grande real were superb, always going out of their way to make you comfortable. The facilities were  clean and in good condition. The SPA was fantastic, food was excellent and the view was gorgeous. It was very nice of the hotel to also give us a complementary bottle of champagne for my husband's birthday. Once again a fantastic experience. We will definitely be  there again soon."
Feb 2019,30,"Weekend break, b&b basis","Had a nice time here although have to admit we were disappointed that we were required to pay for sauna and steam room (€18 per hour)as it was located by thalassotherapy pool. There were no tea / coffee facilities in the rooms and one bottle of water was present upon arrival but having drunk this on day one it wasn’t replaced during our 3 night stay! The fridge/ mini- bar was empty with a card saying to contact reception if you wanted a drink, found this annoying in a five star resort! Surely some soft drinks and water could have been in fridge with the option to pay for them if consumed."
Feb 2019,50,Obrigado ,"Wow! Absolutely amazing! From the moment you arrive to your departure, you are made to feel welcomed, valued and special. The housekeeping was the best we have experienced anywhere and deserves this mention. The hotel and rooms are immaculate! We were always greeted with a smile and nothing was too much trouble. Our friends had a special birthday and arrived back to their room to find wine & cake - just perfect. The breakfast, the burger restaurant, the bar and all the staff we met were excellent. We shall certainly be returning, with the rest of our families. Well done and thank you all, we’ve had a very wonderful and perfect holiday."
Feb 2019,50,Amazing birthday trip,"We are just back from a weeks stay and had a wonderful time, beautiful hotel in a perfect location. We had a sea view room and loved relaxing on the balcony. Breakfast was lovely and had plenty of choice, the staff were friendly and helpful. Saturday was my husbands 40th birthday and although I didn’t directly inform anyone we came back to a birthday cake and a bottle of champagne in our room, such a thoughtful gesture, we will certainly be returning with our teenage sons. Many thanks for a wonderful relaxing holiday."
Feb 2019,50,Wonderful return stay,"Returned to stay for my partners birthday celebration. Again a wonderful stay was had. From arriving to departing everything was great. The friendliness of the staff. Comfort of the room. Amazing sea view (more than worth the supplement). Location is spot on, 15 minute walk to good supermarket and restaurants. The hotel sent a birthday cake and bottle of bubbly to the room on the day of partners birthday. A lovely touch. We then at a fantastic meal in the restaurant (Valentine’s Day menu). And returned to the room to find it decorated in a valentine theme and another bottle of bubbly. Attention to detail in this hotel is wonderful. Would highly recommend staying here and we can’t wait to return. Thank you for a wonderful holiday."
Feb 2019,50,Outstanding staff and great beach location,"This hotel offers an excellent experience! It is a peaceful, green, quiet location with a beautiful beachfront. The spa is great with an indoor Thelasso pool and there are several very good restaurants. The hotel is well maintained including the outdoor pool area overlooking the sea and you can choose between hotel rooms, studios and apartments, What I most appreciated is the staff, who go the extra mile. Pedro Junta, who did an outstanding check-in and on several occasions, went the extra mile to answer my questions and requests thoroughly!  Mfelda at the spa who was very kind and accommodating. Highly recommend this hotel. Thank you!"
Feb 2019,40,"Loved the hotel, avoid the buffett","Beautiful location, wonderful staff throughout the hotel, perfect room and even the weather played ball.stayed in the room overlooking the trees and sea, perfect in every way glad we couldn't get the front on sea view.Beach front bar is a great place to while away the hours overlooking the sea. great valenversary flowers/chocolate dipped fruit and bubbly arranged by the hotel. Staff really cant do enough.only rating 4 stars due to the very, very poor evening buffet, on a standard with the dross given out in the lesser red sea hotels. Very understanding restaurant manager wiped the cost of the food from our bill as it just could not be eaten. really odd as its not cheap and breakfast standard is very good. didn't bother the hotel restaurants after that, too many good places to eat a few minutes walk away.Would certainly go back just wouldn't eat there in the evening."
Feb 2019,50,Great stay in lovely setting,Lovely food with attentive staff. Rooms are light and airy. Beach is a short walk away. We traveled with two babies and staff were really helpful. Close to airport and a lovely location. Great stay and very well priced
Feb 2019,50,5 star service. ,"Well recommended hotel. Fantastic all round,well worth a visit and will be returning soon. Rooms,staff,service,food,bars,beach and the overall experience was first class. We had a sea view room and it really is a fantastic place to stay. Many thanks."
Feb 2019,50,Mini Getaway,"We needed to get away to recharge our batteries and some sunshine. This hotel accomplished both. We went self catering- it was just perfect and relaxing. The beach was just a couple of minutes away. But beware in February there are no deck chairs to sit on the beach, so you have to sit on a towel. The hotel and resort are a little out of the main area, which was perfect for us as all we wanted was peace and quiet. Overall an amazing well spent 4 days and would do it again hopefully very soon again."
Feb 2019,50,Beautiful hotel and location,"The hotel is well located, walking distance from the strip but in a nice quiet area. The room was well appointed and comfortable and the view was beautiful. We would certainly stay here again one day."
Feb 2019,50,Excellent place!!,This hotel was fabulous. The rooms were clean and the atmosphere great! The staff were extremely friendly and responsive to our needs. Would definitely visit them again and recommend them to friends and family alike!!
Feb 2019,40,Very nice,"All round great staff and location of the hotel is perfect only negative is being a 5 star the room did not have a kettle but overall love the staff and their professionalism, diffinently another visit in the future"
Feb 2019,40,Great Break,Well located 5 Star hotel with friendly and well trained staff.Well appointed and comfortable rooms.Good selection of restaurants with excellent breakfast.Beach restaurant has great snack food and good value.Faultless staff who were friendly and helpful. What a shame that guests did not have free access to all Spa & Wellness facilities.
Feb 2019,50,A fab week away,"We stayed at this hotel from 31st Jan 2019 for a week, the hotel is lovely with great access to a fabulous beach. Breakfast was good, my advice is to book in advance the day before as its €20 each on the day which is a bit expensive. For the evening, the food the bar is better than the restaurant. We stayed self catering and the only downside is that there is no where apart from the 15 min walk into the town, to get any things that you need. I know we were out of season, but there was no shop on site. There is a free bus to the old town which is really good. The staff were very friendly, housekeeping came in every day and replaced the towels. I would recommend this hotel for a good value holiday and we will be returning in the future."
Feb 2019,50,Fantastic mini break,"We stayed for 4 nights from the 4 to 8 February 2019.  We booked through On The Beach. From start to finish the entire holiday experience was truly outstanding. We arrived around 10:30am and were greeted with a beaming smile on reception. Here check in was swift and efficient. We were told all about the facilities that the hotel had to offer to include the leisure facilities, where to get food from as we were on a self catering basis and details about the courtesy bus the hotel put on. I read that check in was not until 2pm online so I said to the gentleman on reception that I understood that and we would wait to check in to the room. He said it’s no problem that we could check in straight away which was excellent. He then also told me our apartment had been upgraded to a 1 bedroom apartment complimentary to celebrate my birthday. We were so pleased and thankful for the very kind gesture. So then another gentleman arrived which was the porter to help us with our bags. We walked outside to a golf buggy which he took us in to drive over to our apartment. The complex is in its own private space and quite large. Our apartment was beautiful, spacious and very clean. Upon inspection there was everything you needed to comfortably stay on a self catering basis. Pots, pans, cutlery, microwave, a hob with extractor fan and even bottle opener, knives, chopping board we had everything. We used the courtesy bus. It ran at regular intervals from around 9am to 6:30pm. It does 2 stops, one near the strip with lots of bars, shops and restaurants and the other stop is down to the beach where there are great bars, shops and restaurants. The restaurants at the first stop are great as they are on the beach front so a great location. We are out every lunch time and dinner time we only had breakfast in the apartment. The maid came to service our apartment everyday. She did all the washing up and the usual housekeeping tasks to an extremely high standardNot that we went to watch TV but there was BBC1, ITV and plenty of news and sport channels. My boyfriend was elated with the various sports channels showing football 🙈 We used the gym it’s free. The equipment was adequate but as you expect they are a little dusty given they clearly are not used by many guests. We didn’t use the spa. I found it quite pricy.  To use the indoor pool and sauna it’s 20 euros for 1 hour maximum. I did not personally find that good value for money. We ate at the burger bar on our first night. The food was delicious. I had a veal burger with sweet potato chips and an apple cider. It was an offer for February with a price of 15 euros. My partner had a beef burger. The chips were to die for. The service was excellent. The bill came to 30 euros which wasn’t too bad for hotel prices. My birthday was on the 7th and we had been out all day and there was a knock at our door. They said it was room service. In walks a gentleman with a bottle of prosecco, a birthday cake, 2 champagne flutes, a card and some plates. The hotel had sent it all over for me complimentary and it was such a lovely surprise. I was very happy and it really topped off my birthday and made it that bit more memorable. The pools were just gorgeous. There were 4 that I counted to choose from. We didn’t swim in them as it was too cold but we did dip our feet in. There were plenty of sun beds to choose from. The hotel has its own private section of the beach. You have to walk down some easy steps and your there. It’s all very secure too. No Tom, Dick or Harry can wonder in as you need your room pass to get through the gates. The beach bar was lovely. Lots of seats to sit and enjoy a bite to eat with a very reasonably priced menu. The food was delicious. All in all this hotel was outstanding. Everything about it was excellent. The service, food, location, facilities, absolutely everything. We will be back next year to experience another fantastic holiday on the sun. Well done Grande Hotel Santa Eulalia for making our first trip to Santa Eulalia such a memorable and pleasurable experience."
Feb 2019,50,Amazing,Best hotel and resort I have ever stayed at.... hope to return for a very special ocassion next year.. thanks for all the help and advice Angela.. ( only recommendation would be to change the super bok for Sagres)the special spa treatment for couples was also amazing....can’t wait to return
Feb 2019,50,Great location.  Excellent service.  Definitely will visit again soon. Unfortunately I was visiting just one night.,Fantastic hotel in a great location.  The service was excellent the restaurant was good. Breakfast had many options for different meals.  I look forward to coming back during the summer months to enjoy the location.
Jan 2019,50,Very Enjoyable Stay,"We have no complaints - hotel was excellent ,  for us the sea view  on the third floor was just what we needed, so well worth paying for., idyllic views. - Enjoyed the  a la carte meals in the restaurant. .We cannot wait to make another visit. The courtesy bus to the Old and New Town was a bonus."
Jan 2019,50,Perfect stay,"I’m quite fussy but this superseded my expectations everything was perfect. I aim to return in September with a group of friends. Rooms were spotless with toweling robes and slippers provided, breathtaking sea view, fantastic food and the service from all staff was exceptional. A thoroughly relaxed short break."
Jan 2019,50,An excellent family holiday place would visit again and again,"Very relaxing place for a family holiday would recommend. The menus are delicious, very smart rooms and apartments. The members of stuff are very helpful and friendly. We have made this place our annual holiday place."
Jan 2019,50,Wonderful room and view,We loved our room and view of the beach. We had a relaxing stay.  The only two criticisms are a) the high cost for use of the indoor poolb) the quality of the pillowsStaff were always helpful and not over-officiousThe beach cafe is a useful feature especially as the temperature in January was not quite warm enough to lie on the beach though we did use the outdoor pool with a temperature of 27 which was only just adequate. 2 more degrees would have been lovely!
Jan 2019,50,Lovely hotel,"Hotel was lovely, for adults or children, room was large, clean with a lovely view, would have benefited from a walk in shower instead of over bath but that is a small negative, breakfast was excellent, something for everyone, dinner in main restaurant was very good but limited menu and a trifle expensive."
Jan 2019,40,Our three day stay,Room looked a bit tired bath needs re sealing around the bath this would make all the difference to the room and ones overall assessment. Just one other thing it would make the rooms much more welcoming if they had tea and coffee making facilities available.
Jan 2019,50,Another excellent stay,"This was our fourth stay at this hotel in the past five years - always in January to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We have always been lucky with the weather and this stay, from 11-18 Jan, was no exception. We love this hotel. The staff are helpful and polite, the hotel is very clean, the rooms are comfortable and if you are lucky enough to have a sea-view, it is spectacular. It is located  very handily for nearby Albufeira and there is a free bus service during the week. My only slight criticism of the rooms is that they don't appear to have been re-decorated in the five years since our first stay at this hotel and some of the decor is looking a little tired. That said, I would still certainly recommend this hotel and will be returning next year."
Jan 2019,40,Great stay at grande real Santa Eulália,Myself and my husband recently stayed at this hotel we really enjoyed it we found the staff very friendly and accommodating the hotel itself is stunning and the location is perfect we had a sea view room and would highly recommend it the views were amazing it was spotless and within walking distance from bars and restaurants which was great the only negatives we have are the bed was very hard and we found it hard to sleep some nights and there are no tea and coffee making facilities which I think is needed but overall it wouldn’t put us off we had a great stay and would definitely recommend it to family and friends Suzanne &Gareth lawless
Jan 2019,50,Great short break.,"Stayed here for three nights for part of my partners Birthday. Hotel provided a gift in the room on arrival. Rooms are spacious and spotless, great Seaview.Fantastic breakfast with a wide variety to choose from. Can't fault our stay."
Jan 2019,50,Visit to Algarve,Great location for our trip to Algarve.    We did not make use of the amenities available at the resort as we were there to sightsee around the area.  We did make use of the access to the beach as we enjoy a daily walk before setting out to see the area.
Jan 2019,50,100% 5 Star,"The staff were not only very helpful but friendly , greeting you with a smile on every occasion. Nothing was too much bother and were only too grateful to help. I can't recommend your hotel and staff enough and look forward to our next visit. You should be very proud of your organisation.Kind RegardsMichael Bridges"
Jan 2019,40,Friendly Atmosphere and Convenient Location,"We stayed for two weeks and enjoyed the hotel and conveniences. We were in a townhouse style accommodation which provided a sitting area, large bedroom and well stocked kitchenette. There was a private patio overlooking lawns and a pool. Shuttle service was available to the hotel where there were dining and bar facilities etc. There was a frequent shuttle service into Albufeira for shopping and tourist activities. The staff was very friendly. Overlall the facilities were well cared for but will require some updating fairly soon. It was very family friendly."
Jan 2019,50,Quiet and comfortable,"Stayed 4 nights at this hotel.  The bed was really comfortable.  The decor in the room is simple with basic furniture.  Hotel was built in 2004 and the bathroom is the easiest place to see the age.  We were there at the low season and the hotel was not even half full.  However, that does not affect the quality of the buffet breakfast offered.  There was a good variety and even sparkling wine for those who want champagne with breakfast!One minor complaint is that the wi-fi hardly worked in our room.  Every time I need to use the internet, I had to go down to the reception.  It was strange because our room was 2 floors right above the reception. There is a shuttle bus with 2 stops.  We did not take that because it was too late to catch the return trip.  So we opted to drive, which was not too far.  About 2 km from the hotel, there is a street which is full of restaurants.  There are plenty of free parking inside the resort."
Jan 2019,30,Tired hotel for a 5 star,"The hotel was tired and in need of a refresh.  We stayed here over New Year and there was very little to do.  The hotel had a New Years Eve party but it was by ticket admission only and they were all sold out by the time we got there - surely as a paying hotel guest, ticket admission should have been included? We were left with very little to do on New Years Eve.  The hotel had many bar and restaurant areas but only one was open - we were told this was because of the time of year.  Surely if the hotel is open, the facilities to go with it should be open too?  However, the food available was good. There wasn't much in the way of evening entertainment.  The location was a little remote.  The hotel did provide a shuttle bus service into the old town, but only Monday to Friday and only until 6.30pm. There was no shuttle service at the weekend so we used the local busses to get around.  Taxis were available and fairly priced also.  The room itself was average and looked out onto the car park.  There were no drinks provisions in the room itself (i.e tea/coffee).  All in all, I wouldn't go back - certainly not at this time of year.  If a hotel is open, it should be open, not half open, regardless of the season.  I wouldn't say this hotel warrants 5 start status."
Jan 2019,40,Nice Stay,"My wife and I stayed here for a week, overall the experience was very good.The room was clean and well laid out and the kitchen was really good, normally you get a hob with two rings that don't get hot enough, but in this case it was a proper electric hob which was great, the microwave also doubles up as an oven, but when I tried to do some oven chips in it, they came out a bit sogy and took quite a long time.We stayed in room 301, which was very well laid out and very clean, Beds were great and comfortable and we had no problem sleeping.The only 2 downsides of that particular room was that on an evening it got cold and although there is warm air from the air conditioning, there is a wall between where the A/C is and the living room, therefore the heat didn't get to the living space. The other downside was the small balcony, whhich also has the A/C unit on it.We didn't eat there so cannot comment on the food.Overall the hotel is very good and I recommend it, however, for us it was a bit far from the old town and in our opinion this is where you need to be as the restaurants seem a lot better."
Jan 2019,50,Good,Had a five day break with my wife and was very very impressedThe hotel was lovely and the staff were excellentNot too far away from old and new towns with a free shuttle service which helpsWill definitely be returning in april
Jan 2019,40,WiFi strong!/ efficient and friendly staff,"The welcome at reception was warm, professional and efficient. Reception staff reconfirmed my outgoing transfer on mym behalf because the office was closed and I had to leavel to go on an excursion. We were not able to check in early but stored our bags until 3pm. The room and bathroom were very spacious and mostly clean. There were hairs that weren't my own in the bathroom which were not cleaned before I arrived until 2 days into my stay and the chair by the window had suspicious stains on it!. The walls are paper thin between rooms. There is a safe, hair dryer, shower gel and body creams, shower cap, shoe shine cloth, sanitary bags and ""vanity"" stuff- ie. Cotton buds, cotton wipe. Towels were clean. WiFi was strong at all times, I had no problems.I was happy in general. The only improvements I would like would be for the gym to be open 24hours. I was often on excursions during the hours of 8am-8pm so I only managed to use it once for 15minutes. I would probably wouldn't have selected this hotel if I had known the gym opening hours beforehand. The spa massages are also a bit too expensive though the one I had was nice. The changing room had an unpleasant smell though. My friends used the other facilities and told me the jacuzzi water temperature was too cold. The staff within the spa were very courteous and helpful though. There were seagulls but not as many as I expected given previous reviews.Some of my excursions meant I had to leave before breakfast service. Room service delivered breakfast to my room on request, though It did not include any of the hot food options and the choice was limited in comparison to the breakfast offered in the restaurant.The breakfast selection wasn't clearly labelled for allergens but staff were able to inform me when I asked. The food is typical of most resorts. I was not sure if the oranges were local. I only ate the fruit and pastries so cannot comment on the hot foods.I would recommend booking excursions outside of the hotels reccommended ones which were a lot more expensive. There is a spot in the new town on the main road (I forget the name) but I paid 22Euros for the Lisbon day trip. The place is about a 4 minute walk from the hotel's free shuttle drip off point in the new town. You have to cross the road, walk back in the direction the shuttle came and take your first right and the place is on your left.This resort might be too expensive for me in the high season but it is a nice place to stay"
Jan 2019,50,New Year Break,"Great Hotel, The minor negatives were room did not get any Sun on balcony Rowing machine needs maintenance as in Chain/Bearing were noisy Only one of the outside pools appeared to be heated ..... the rest were colder than the Sea brrr"
Jan 2019,40,Xmas break,"Returned for my ninth visit to this hotel. Some refurbishment since my last visit - wooden floor in bedroom but nothing else I could see.  However the room was fine for me as the location with the sea-view was my prime reason for choosing the hotel.  Requests  I made prior to arriving were given which was much appreciated.   Everything was spotlessly clean with cleaners even washing cups and plates in room. Food in bar and restaurant still needs improving. Have to say that Christmas Eve buffet was exceptional with great food, wine and entertainment - more of this please !! All staff were very helpful and friendly, this is particularly important when you are a solo traveller as sometimes you can just feel invisible - this is not the case here. Love the location of this hotel and am sure will be back sometime in the future."
Jan 2019,40,Excellent choice,Very good resort. Apartment was very clean and had good stacked kitchen. Sad indoor pool is not available for kids. Beach side restaurant was really good. Breakfast is decent but hot options were only warm!
Jan 2019,30,4 star hotel disguising as 5 star,"The 5 star raying must be due to its location, spa facilities and own bus. The apartments are very dated and upon arrival ours smelled very musty as if no one had stayed in it for a while. We were overcharged by 160 euros at check out and had a lot of trouble to get refund which had to be in euro cash as they could not credit my card?"
Jan 2019,30,"Instant coffee machines, tasteless meals","This place is not better than a 1 star place regarding it's food and coffee. Service is OK, but the food for 10 days has been tasteless and boring. Instant coffee machines the worst so now travelling with my own coffee. This all adds up to an OK time instead of what was expected.  Toilet paper and hand towel paper just like the Parks department in National parks. Grey and rough. Clean rooms and some rooms have great sea views."
Jan 2019,50,2nd time and loved it,Food fabulous. Went for Xmas and everything was amazing. On a fabulous beach. Rooms in the apartments were so clean and spacious. We will definitely be returning. Shame that the spa wasn't in with the price though but apart from that we all loved it.
Jan 2019,30,"Friendly staff, but hotel can be uniquely frustrating.","The rooms were very clean, spacious and there were a number of TV channels. The beach view was impeccable. There is no facility to make tea in the room, which was peculiar for a five star hotel. What surprised us more was the front desk.We asked for a plate and an ashtray (for the balcony) and the reception promptly forgot. Asking them hours later they admitted to this and sent us a ramekin (good enough), but no plate or explanation. When asking the next day for the plate we were told they would charge us for an empty plate. They also suggested that we should ask the dinner service, which we did and they promptly directed us to the reception. It was a very singular experience at a supposedly five star hotel.The ingredients used for the food are very good, but many of the dishes are far too overcooked. This is especially a problem for fish like tuna which were rendered inedible. More troubling yet, there was a chilli for dinner on the 25 of December, the leftovers of which were used to make a moussaka the following day. This was very disappointing and the awful meals (Christmas meal was good though) detracted from our vacation.What was actually infuriating is that there were no beverages (I mean tap water or even juice) with dinner. I understand that this might be a nationwide norm, but at a five star hotel this came across very poorly. It left a far worse taste than the food. How is it remotely acceptable to not offer coffee or tea after dinner or with dessert? I should mention that they have live music five days a week which was really good. Filipe Neves, especially, was a remarkably talented musician.The bar in the foyer is very well stocked. When he was available Renato was able to make any sort of cocktail I could think of and he was a uniquely talented individual. These were easily the best mixed drinks I have ever had. Renato, Reuben (laurenco?) and Abel were amazing staff and if we were to return it would be because of our experiences with them."
Jan 2019,50,Beautiful location,We stayed here for 7 nights . Love the location as the beach is just one min walking distance from the hotel. All staff are extremely friendly and they are very good with our 1.5 year old son. Highly recommended !!
Dec 2018,50,Amazing Stay!,"Really nice stay, very polite staff at reception, kind housekeeping staff. Access to beach was really good and spacious accommodation. Definitely recommend this place. Not very far from local shops, old town etc"
Dec 2018,50,"Great family hotel, the staff are extremely courteous and helpful.","First time in the Algarve with my wife (whose birthday we were celebrating) and 2 sons. Stayed from 16th-26th Dec 2018 in the sea facing room 347.What can I say, one of the best holidays we've had as a family ! The hotel is a very welcoming environment, the staff are extremely courteous and accommodating. Although the entire staff were brilliant - few of the many names I recollect - the manager Pedro, the reception staff Jorge and the restaurant staff Alexandra were very helpful.We had the a la carte for a few days and the buffet on others. The variety and taste was of a very high standard.The outdoor facilities for children (pools, play area) were clean and tidy. The reception lobby and the space leading upto the pool and beach are very open and airy areas which we enjoyed as a family.The Santa Eulalia beach was one of the best in the Algarve - the beach is a short walk via the sea facing restaurant. We also spent Christmas at the resort where there was a special dinner for 2 nights and live music. It was good to see my son's requests being played.Sure the resort is showing it's age a little bit, but the location, staff, food and entertainment more than make up for that.We had a memorable 10 days, will not only recommend to friends and family, but will visit again !"
Dec 2018,50,Excellent,Had a lovely 3 days holiday in Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and hotel Spa for my Husbands Birthday The sea view and room was lovely and we had a relaxing time enjoying the view from our bedroom and the position of the hotel straight onto the beach we would recommend  this hotel
Dec 2018,50,Excellent customer service,"Excellent customer service. My room overlooking the beach, beautiful view. Love everything except that guests were required to pay to use indoor pool. It should be free in December because of the weather. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay. Thanks."
Dec 2018,40,Enjoyable stay.,"Very clean and well maintained hotel , rooms are spacious , plenty of toiletries , bath robes and slippers, only downside was no tea and coffee facilities in the room, free safe and also a fridge . Food at breakfast was good , only had one meal in the in the hotel as we ate out every day , the meal was ok. The free shuttle bus was excellent although it does not run weekends, would defiantly stay here again."
Dec 2018,50,Great Hotel,Great hotel but little entertainment a little out the way unless you hire a car. Hotel was clean and well serviced by staff. Would definitely stay agin but more in the busy season as not that much atmosphere.
Dec 2018,50,5-star quality and great price,"It was great visit of us at the hotel. We liked the room service, cleanliness and understanding of the manager for our request. We were compensated for our inconvenience genuinely. We were happy with our stay at the hotel."
Dec 2018,50,Lovely stay,We had a wonderful stay for 3 days. The location was perfect. Breakfast had both hot and cold spreads. The hotel also arranged for a birthday surprise with complimentary cake and sparkling wine . We would love to be back again. Thank you for making it a memorable trip.
Dec 2018,40,A birthday treat for my grandson,"This  is a very nice hotel, let down by the lack of an indoor pool for the winter months. a Gym that is only open during the SPA hours ( no early morning workout possible before break fast).The food in the Restaurant was very good, extensive choice for breakfast, we had the same dinner menu for 5 nights in a row. There was a lengthy power cut  one afternoon which went UN acknowledged  by the hotel staff to the guests, It left the corridors very dark, no emergency lighting.Could be serious in the middle of the night if the fire alarm went off and the power!"
Dec 2018,40,very good,very good hotel.stay was very enjoyable.late booking so pleased with everything.only problem at breakfast food was not hot enough...but apart from that would recommend the hotel.plenty of live entertainment at night.
Dec 2018,40,"Gorgeous Beach Location, Great Staff...",Enjoyed a brief stay at GRSE in Sept 2018. Lovely comfy beds and well appointed bedroom. The ease of access to beach & restaurants a major plus. Albufeira Shuttle bus convenient.. But surprised the hall corridor carpets were so dirty and tired looking which sadly let’s down what is otherwise a fab 5* Hotel with fab staff.
Dec 2018,40,Beautiful hotel; shame about the carpets ,"Beautiful hotel! Staff were so friendly and the rooms were very comfortable. The only negative I have to say is the carpets outside the hotel rooms are old and very stained which let's down the wonderful facilities this hotel has to offer. We stayed last year, this may have been rectified since our stay but at the time we just found this disappointing in a 5 star property."
Dec 2018,50,Spacious rooms brilliant location,"Staff were very friendly. Spacious rooms excellent value for money. Buffet breakfast was very good with good variety of food , however would have been better if there was more vegetarian options. Overall excellent!!!"
Dec 2018,50,holiday winter break,The best Hotel I have ever been in. It says star it is not to me it is a 10 star if that is possible. The staff are brilliant in reception and all over the hotel they would do anything for you..It is a minutes walk to a beautiful beach.We traveled at the end of November and it was nice and quite.
Dec 2018,50,Thank you for the nice stay,"a very nice and relaxing holiday. Thank you for the great serviceBreakfast with sparkling wine large selection at different prices, dinner very good, something for every taste.Rooms are very clean, nice big balcony with sea view, we had a very beautiful stay and will be back"
Dec 2018,40,December,"Great hotel and apartments, weather was amazing, but as to be expected almost all the attractions for leisure were closed at this time of year, which was unfortunate, I reckon this place would be an excellent resort in the height of summer for all types of holidays, young or old. I would personally go back and revisit in the summertime to see all of what could be on offer around the area, staff very friendly and answered all questions which are put to them, Hopefully see you next years guys, thankyou for my stay."
Dec 2018,40,"Nice stay, but a little improvement needed","I stayed here 4 nights. The breakfast was fantastic and the value was nice, but the service and facility of this hotel need a little improvement.There were a lot of noise from the aisle all the time and also some noise from the bed in the room.The biggest problem was that my room was not cleaned until 9 PM. Also some service I requested was not handled well and nobody knew the reasons."
Dec 2018,50,Can't wait to come back,Well what can I say I have now stayed in your hotel 5 times and have brought different family members with me. The sea view is out of this world the breakfast is fabulous we ate in the restaurant on two evenings and the food was delicious. The beach bar snacks are great too and it is all so convenient. This was our first trip to Albufeira in December time and I guess we were so lucky as it was 20 degrees everyday what more could you ask for. The shuttle bus is so handy and a great service. Can't wait to come back
Dec 2018,50,Perfect location and good service,Everithing was exelent . Very calm sourandings and friendly staff.If you choose seawiew you can go to sleep listening to  waves from the sea..The only thing we missed was kettle to make coffe or tea.
Dec 2018,50,great stay,"5 star service nice hotel, nice staff and great location set on the beach. spent a week here for my 50 th birthday ,upgraded on arrival to a sea view suit . nice touch on my birthday came back to room to find hotel left champagne and a cake . all in all lovely location, hotel and staff and a bonus sat around the pool in late November"
Dec 2018,40,Not five star!!,"This hotel is in a lovely area, and the views from pool area and beach bar are fabulous, with easy access to a lovely beach. As mentioned earlier staff are all so friendly and polite and rooms are clean and changed daily, however this is defo not a five star hotel as advertised. The bathroom is very dated (although clean) and room old fashioned, although my biggest gripe was the beds......they were so uncomfy.we stayed four nights, it was an anniversary break, and after second night we asked at reception could we change rooms as not only were beds so hard and uncomfy,they were two singles pushed together and kept coming apart. Receptionist who was lovely said every room is the same so not worth upgrading, and said they would put mattress topper on (which made no difference it was just another mattress protector on top of the original one). I now have a really aching back and am so tired and can't wait to sleep in my own bed tonight, I stay in hotels alot and this is probably the most uncomfy room I've ever stayed in and have come away from holiday shattered. The only reason I gave given four stars is the staff and hotels location and the breakfast was good ale, but would never recommend this hotel if you want a decent night sleep."
Dec 2018,40,Winter Getaway!,"Because of the time of year parts of hotel were not open ie. Pool Bars Club Kids club etc.The shuttle bus to and from the hotel is super, but would be great if it went on weekends! To use the thermal pool in the spa you had to pay an extra €20 (even though we paid for massages on that day) which we were very shocked over!Location is lovely - restaurants within walking distance are nothing special but going into Albufiera was great and also we ate mostly at the beach bar (food ok - pizza was from a box though)Staff were super nice.Beach hotel is on is devine! Small, but so gorgeous.We did self catering and apartment was spotless. Decor & couches very outdated but didn't mind everything worked.Could hear everything outside of bedroom windows so I'd imagine in summer you would hear alot - luckily we came during a quiet season."
Dec 2018,40,Lovely but needs financial investment,A hotel we like very much.A vast beachfront hotel with great facilities. Pool area with views of beach.Breakfast very good but did not dine at night as 30 euro is much too expensive for a hotel buffet esp in the middle of winter. Excellent restaurants up the road in Olhos d'Aqua with 3 course dinner with free house wine for around 10 euros. Many of the hotel restaurant's table are wobbly and this needs to be checked. Excellent staff smiling and with a will to please. Beautiful views from pool view rooms.Now for the not so good points!Rooms are not really up to 5*standard.Worn out furniture and new wooden floors that do not match the furniture style or colour.Bathroom again are from another era tired and dated.Unfortunately  i hate to say it but the only thing that's 5*here is the staff and the service they provide.
Dec 2018,40,Great Hotel!,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for 5 nights in October, could not fault the hotel it was pretty, clean, very tidy and the rooms were cleaned top to bottom every day, towels were replaced, beds made and even our clothes folded and any washing up we had left was done for us daily!We stayed in an apartment away from the main hotel this was not far from the main building.Food was good although we only had breakfast there. Location is pretty good, we got taxis to the strip most nights for about 5 euros, and went to zoomarine and the shopping centre all by taxi for a decent price. Only reason I marked this hotel down is because I felt there was not any onsite entertainment! Apart from that we had a lovely time!!"
Dec 2018,50,Bev W,"Just returned for a short 4 night break here. It was the first time we had been to Albufuria and were very impressed.  We stayed Wednesday to Sunday. We found the hotel to be just what we needed for a relaxing break. We had a garden view room which was nice. The room was of a lovely size and so were the beds although slightly on the hard side, they were certainly big enough with plenty of pillows. It was nice to stay in a hotel which provided enought coat hangers in a double room for 2 people. The rooms had bath robes and slippers which were a nice touch after a shower. However there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room which was the only downside to the rooms. You could order via room service however a coffee was around €2 which was ok, but the room service charge of €5 made for an expensive early morning  coffee.The hotel restaurants and bars were very nice. The breakfast provided a good selection and was of a good quality. The bar had a nice touch of providing ""nibbles"" when ordering afternoon drinks and again provided a good selection.We found all the staff very helpful and friendly. The service from start to fi ish including reception staff, room cleaning and restaurant/bar staff was all second to none. Unfortunately during our stay there was a large business conference on and the same could not be said about the delegates attending that who were down right rude and self orientated, however this is not the hotels fault. The location for us was exactly what we were looking for. It was right on the beach which provided excellent views and walks. The complimentary shuttle ride into both the old and new town was good however wasn't very frequent especially for returning. Local taxis were reasonable and cost between €4 and €8 depending on which part of the town you go to. Be warned though the taxis the hotel book are extortionate in comparison and seem to charge what they like.  Overall we were very impressed with our stay and are planning on returning very soon for another long weekend getaway. We will definately be trying a sea view room next time. Thank you for a wonderful relaxing long weekend break."
Dec 2018,50,Class Hotel at Great Price,If you are looking for a good hotel at great prices...look no further. Forget the Marbella's of Spain...over priced. This hotel has it all. If you are looking for a class hotel at prices which are great....hotel ..don't increase the prices...lol. Great prices in high season..forget Nice and Marbella...come here. If all in inclusive..forget the evening meal and go for the lunch instead...pure class.
Nov 2018,30,November not a good month!,"The free shuttle was unavailable. When staff were asked about this, they just shrugged. Taxi fare was 10€ round trip to the nearest bars and restaurants. This added 70 Euros to our stay. The Spa facilities at the hotel are NOT included in the price and are a very expensive edition. I asked about using the indoor heated pool as the weather outside was cold and I was told it would cost 80 Euros and I would have to complete all of the hydrotherapy spa stations, and there was a maximum time limit of 1 hour and 15 mins in the pool. Only 1 restaurant was open. NO tea/coffee making facilities in room and tea/coffee expensive to purchase from the bar. Staff didn't seem to care much about any of my concerns."
Nov 2018,50,Excellent Hotel with excellent service and very friendly staff. Great food in main restaurant and great bar in main lobb,Excellent Hotel with excellent 5star service. Food excellent in main restaurant and very friendly and polite staff. Great breakfast buffet with lots of variety. Even decaffeinated coffee option on machines. Spa treatments great. Avail of offers as normal price on the high side. 20mins walk to main strip. €3.80 in a taxi. Lovely beach cafe and nice small beach. Would highly recommend a stay here. Will be returning soon. Obrigado
Nov 2018,50,Great stay for business,"Beautiful hotel with lovely staff! I didn't use many of the facilities, other than for breakfast because I was only there for one night for business, however I will definitely be returning for leisure!"
Nov 2018,40,Great Value for money- off season.,"We stayed over a long weekend in November 2018. Perfect location but we had a car and could come and go as pleased. Beautiful, clean, large bedroom  amazing breakfast. Staff were dreadful in main restaurant at dinner time  we were literally left sitting there waiting to order for ages and then when our food finally arrived we were not approached once by any member of staff to enquire if we needed or wanted anything else.. ie water, drinks, dessert menu etc  it was the worst waiter service I've ever experienced. Needless to say we only had dinner there once and went further afield after that. Definitely not 5 star restaurant service but I can't knock the quality of the food which was lovely.  Staff simply need better managing. The indoor pool and sauna/steamroom was an extra cost of €20 per person for 1 hour which I found very expensive."
Nov 2018,50,Definitely recommend,Stayed here before and loved it so relaxing. returned to view venues in Portugal and booked this hotel for our wedding as we love it so much .staff are so friendly apartments are well equipped and cleaned everyday can’t wait to return
Nov 2018,50,Short Break,"Just back from a brief 4 night stay. Fantastic staff throughout, very attentive and friendly. The selection at breakfast was great with an abundance of fresh fruit and pastry options. It’s worth upgrading to the sea view as it is really spectacular. Just as a suggestion as the weather was quite mixed we opted to stay around the hotel. I know there is a games room during peak season but it would be great if there was a pool table or a few indoor activities for guests when the weather is bad. We also used the spa service which was great again very professional and courteous staff. Evening meals were also really good, we don’t normally eat in hotels in the evenings but again due to the weather and limited options nearby due to it being off season we chose to stay local and weren’t disappointed. All in all a great hotel in a peaceful location for a quiet get away. Really nice for a couples break this time of year. Will definitely return."
Nov 2018,50,November Stay,"Lovely Hotel with very nice Self catering rooms, comfortable and spacious. Very nice location away from the hub bub of the New town, Courtesy Bus provided to take guests to new/old town Taxi to/from old town 8Euros. Supermarket within walking distance."
Nov 2018,50,one small choice that you make for your clients,"Dear management team, I want to thank you for your effort, as we've really enjoy our stay, epecially the service and the location of the hotel. Nevertheless, in our opinion, there is on issue you can still work on and it's quite important one - how enviromental friendly you are. I found it very sad and dissapointing, that at Atlantico cafe the healthiest beverage, the smoothy, was being served only in plastic cups. We didn't order it for that reason. Believe me, it's a pain to sit there overlooking the ocean and having a drink from the huge one-way cup! As many of your visiters are from the northerb countries, I bet they might have an issue with that as well. Same with Nespresso at the lobby bar, by the way. It's neither cheep, nor good and most of the people got it by now. My hearthy advice to you is work on the quality of  your coffee (I had to switch to tea to avoid it, which is fine, but not for anyone) and get rif of plastic where possible. That will make you even the greatest place!Thank you and hopfully see you one day soon in Albufeira.Best regardsNatalia Zhukova"
Nov 2018,50,"Great hotel, lovely staff!","This is a beautiful hotel with lovely helpful staff.From checking in to checking out we didn't have a single problem. The Kids Club was especially helpful keeping our 3yr old daughter entertained with activities and games. I was surprised they were still open considering there was only 5 kids at the hotel that week. The rooms are lovely! We had the sea view suite which had a lovely view any time of the day. Was pleasantly surprised to find the suite had 2 large bathrooms in it which were cleaned daily... And the bed! I wish my bed at home was this comfortable. My only complaint was that there was no teas or coffees in the room, this is the first hotel I have been to in the world that didn't have teas and coffees or even a kettle in the room as standard. When I questioned this I was told I would need to order and pay for it via room service which I thought was really cheeky.Overall a lovely little break with the family."
Nov 2018,50,'Real' gem,"This is our second visit to this fabulous hotel and we are already looking to visit again next year. Fabulous location for a tranquil, relaxing holiday. Sea view rooms highly recommended. Staff are fabulous and can't do enough for you. Would highly recommend."
Nov 2018,50,2. time in Grande Real Santa Eulalia and not the last time ;-),"Top hotel, friendly and competent staff, clean rooms, direct beach location, very good and rich food, free shuttle bus into the city. Wellness area unfortunately not used, we will test the next visit."
Nov 2018,50,november stay at Grand Real Santa Elulia,my wife fell and broke ankle on first day. we still had a pleasant stay. hotel provided wheelchair. luckily we had half board in hotel. all staff were very helpful . food very good . would recommend this hotel
Nov 2018,50,Another lovely stay at Granda Real Santa Eulalia Resort,Last time we stay in the Hotel this time we stayed in their apartment and enjoyed it as much as the first time staff really helpful cant fault this resort thank you for a lovely stay yet again we will certainly be back in the nearer future
Nov 2018,50,Excellent,14th November 2018 john dublin ireland we stayed 5 nights the hotel is one of the best we stayed in and could not fault one thing staff and cleanliness was top class food and facilities were top class
Nov 2018,50,Love this resort,"Loved Many things about this place. Not sure where to start. The breath taking view of the beach, room cleanliness, great customer service of all employees and most importantly the smile on their faces that was just warm and welcoming.."
Nov 2018,40,Beach in Front,"Missed using of inside pool, no access for every hotel guest - only for SPA guest. The SPA Area isn't attractiv. We used the clean GYM. Outside pools very comfortably and generous. The Beach is directly in front and clean."
Nov 2018,50,Relaxing,"Love the place, friendly staff,relaxing environment could not ask for better. Wish I was still there, cant wait to be there again, hopefully next time get to do more things and stay a little longer I hope."
Nov 2018,40,Lunch by the beach,Stopped from lunch by the beach after exploring the area. Parked by the beach and walked up to the beach bar. Was served by a blonde haired lady who at first was very nice and delivered our food swiftly. We had burgers and steak baguette. The setting was really nice and was a busy bar. Once the lady was coming back to collect our food we were chatting to her and then she started a conversation with one of the other waiters. We found it very rude and unprofessional hence the 4 stars rather than the 5. Will come back as the food is nice.
Nov 2018,50,"Location, Location, Location","Total relaxation in a wonderful setting.  Excellent service, wonderful breakfast and a place to completely unwind. Would like to see upgrade in bedrooms especially much more comfortable beds.Housekeeping has been cutback."
Nov 2018,40,A Beautiful Location,"A lovely large hotel on the beach so location was great. A free bus is provided to take to the Strip and Old town. The choice for breakfast was superb - so much to choose from.The room was fine and beds comfortable although you have to pay extra for sea view side. Although there was a fridge provided there was no tea/coffee facilities which was disappointing for s 5 star rated hotel. We had an issue with air conditioner but to be fair they sent someone up right away to fix it. All the staff are very pleasant.There are no shops nearby unless you’re prepared to walk about 1km uphill. There are a couple of nice restaurants that I would recommend you try. The massages on the spa were lovely and the offer on when we were there was €45,"
Nov 2018,50,very good,"it was the second time we stayed in Grande real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel. the hotel is very good and the location is really beautiful. the rooms are large, the bathrooms to. The breakfast is very good; you can choose of many fresh food."
Nov 2018,40,"Lovely hotel , great location","We had a lovely suite with sea views, cleaned daily,2 bathrooms, 2TV sets, not that we watched them much, staff are helpful and efficient, food is typical hotel food, mostly fish, but always something to enjoy.The hotel does lack some atmosphere though, evening entertainment mediocre, but otherwise a good experience."
Nov 2018,50,Great resort hotel near Albufeira,I stayed here for a week in November to go cycling in the Algarve. It was very good as a central base and it was always nice to come back to the spacious apartment. We had half board and found the breakfast and evening dinner to be of very good quality and offered a very good variety of choices.
Nov 2018,50,Girls Holiday!,"Had a girls week away for half term and expected there to be a lot of families here but there really wasn’t many. A beautiful hotel, with fantastic, friendly staff, great food and gorgeous surroundings. We had a great apartment with a fantastic balcony that had sun on it all day and a lovely pool view it was very clean and spacious. There is nothing negative I can say about this hotel and as it was my first ever visit to Portugal I’d definitely come back again! Right on the private beach with several pools, one of which is heated. The hotel booked us a taxi several times too and we always had the same taxi driver, the lovely Nuno who was very friendly and made us feel very safe! We were a short taxi ride from the Strip and the Old town both of which had lots going on, but fairly quiet this time of year. I couldn’t recommend this hotel highly enough and will definitely come back again!"
Nov 2018,40,"Lovely, clean beach front hotel","We are on our last day of a week long stay at this hotel. Great first impressions of the hotel, the hotel is situated right on the beach literally a minute walk from the pool and a 15 minute walk to the new town (strip) the hotel do regular free buses to the new and old town which was a lovely added bonus. Rooms are clean and have everything you need, we stayed on the 3rd floor. We opted for full board, shame they didn't offer all inclusive. You are given food vouchers for lunch and dinner, this did make us feel slightly like a child at school Plenty of choice at breakfast, one slight critique would be the food seems to go cold fairly quick. We were a little confused at the 'rules' of the restaurant when it came to lunch but it turns out it's a full 3 course meal, the food at lunch was amazing and lived up to the 5 star rating, salmon and steak for lunch every day and cooked to perfection, one of the best meals I've ever had and consistently good. Buffet food was available in the evening, I don't feel it's catered to the British very much but then maybe I'm just a bit fussy, I still couldn't fault the effort the chefs put into the dishes and the displays, offering octopus and all sorts. I still found a good 3 options each night despite being fussy, again food could do with being slightly warmer. The puddings are brilliant too especially the lavender panacotta! We were not blessed with the warm weather so did not get any use out of the pool despite it being heated it could have done with being a bit warmer. Plenty sun beds and outdoor tables to eat at though. The reason this hotel lost a star is due to being disappointed the indoor pool is only available if you pay for the spa and the lack of evening entertainment. Just a guy on the guitar every night, he was good but the hotel was definitely lacking for this reason. The hotel is used a lot by the locals for events, there seemed to be some herbalife promotion going on and you often felt out of place and under dressed with everyone walking around. Saying all this I would still recommend this hotel to family and friends but just leave the hotel at night for entertainment. In November the nightlife is so limited although we did find a few bars to stop at. Needed a bit more for a couple around the age of 30 to do."
Nov 2018,30,More like a nice hotel than a resort,"The Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel is one of those accommodations conveniently located right by the Santa Eulália beach. However, it was very hard for me to justify describing this place as a resort.Location:The resort is located in Albufeira but away from the city center (which is about a 15-minute walk), but there are some restaurants nearby.Room:We got a lovely one-bedroom apartment, meaning that there was a dedicated bedroom, in addition to the living room/kitchen area. Both the bedroom and living area had its own TV.Closet & storage space:There were two closets in the room, which was very much appreciated for 2 people. One was in the bedroom while the other was in the living area. Each closet was not wide, but big enough to hang about 8 clothes as well as 4 drawers to keep folded itemsBathroom:The bathroom has an automatic ventilation fan, which turns off automatically after a certain period of time. It was large and fully stocked, with plenty of counter space. The bathtub drain was a bit slow but the shower worked well with adequate water pressure.Work Desk:There was a small work desk in bedroom, which was right by the door so any desk work was done in the kitchen on the round kitchen table which had a lot more free space.Night Stand:There are night stands on both sides of the king size bed. I also appreciated the number of electrical outlets which made charging our electronics worry free.Safe:The safe is in the closet, which worked well.Climate Control:The climate control was in both the kitchen and bedroom. It kept the temperature at 22 degrees Celsius very well.Kitchen:The kitchen was fully equipped with a sink, refrigerator, 4-burner stove, kettle, and plenty of glasses, plates, bowls, pot, and pans. We even appreciated the maid washing our dishes and pans while we were out for the day.Exterior Noise:There is not much soundproofing so there were some nights or early morning when we were able to hear people talking outside.Wi-Fi:The wi-fi worked very well throughout the whole room.Elevators:Visiting our friends staying at another part of the resort required taking the elevators, which responded quickly.Check-in and Check-out:Check in and check out were polite. The staff answered all our questions.Lobby:The lobby is vast, which includes a bar/restaurant in the back. I was rather put off by the rude reception I got at the bar when I wanted a simple orange drink. Breakfast:Some room rates include the breakfast buffet while others do not. We opted to try it for one day but felt it was not worth the cost. There is plenty of food but none of it was cooked to the standard one expects from a resort.Parking:We did notice on-site parking but the amount of space is limited.Pools:In addition to the beach, the resort also has two pools (one for children, one for adults) with many deck chairs around.Overall:As much as it looked nice, I really felt disappointed by the Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel; I guess I was expecting more when I see the word resort. If you are just planning some quiet time on the beach during your stay here, you should be satisfied. If you are looking for more than that, it will be a challenge."
Nov 2018,40,Long Weekend stay,"The booking in was smooth, the room was very clean, the bed was fantastic, I can't comment on the restaurant food but the breakfast was fine.  The Spa treatment was lovely, would definitely stay again."
Nov 2018,50,Ladies week away,"What a great place to stay ! Food excellent although a little warmer and a bit more vegetarian choice would be great ! Nice Buck’s Fizz option at breakfast (after all we were on holiday 🥂) . The staff are so friendly and helpful from , booking in to room service, to checking out . Faultless. Pools are beautiful and kept immaculate at all times . We stayed in the apartments which were great and spacious, although a little tired but very clean and housekeeping was top standard. Will definitely be returning."
Nov 2018,50,Luxury good value hotel in Albufeira,"We stayed 3 nights in a resort-facing suite in the main building. Can't fault the service and the room. Breakfast choices each day was quite similar, however you had a lot to choose from so you could try something different each day. The Santa Eulalia beach was one of the most beautiful beaches in Albufeira and was a 3 minute walk from the resort and it had direct access through a back gate. The free shuttle to the new town and old town was an added bonus as the location isn't great. However, the last bus was at 18:10 so you could take a taxi back, which was under €8"
Nov 2018,50,"Large gated complex with hotel central, beautiful location and welcoming staff","Overall a lovely holiday, pity we didn't get the best of weather although didn't expect much at that time of year. The hotel itself is stunning and great location. The apartments very big and well maintained by regular visits from maids. Some small area's could do with attention but overall lovely. We had 1st floor apartment, one bedroom, lounge could sleep 4 kids easily, good range of cooking facilities, terrace got the sun all day. Would be perfect for family over looking grass area to play and over looking pool and view out to the sea. Private bus into Albufeira shopping / strip and Old town, basically each hour.. I have already recommended to my younger brother and sister, to take their younger children. Great holiday, thank you and hopefully explore more in the future."
Nov 2018,50,Spacious clean bedrooms,"We had a Sea view room at the hotel, gorgeous view and incredibly clean room. We were celebrating our honeymoon and unfortunately no tea at included so if you are celebrating an occasion (considering it's a 5 star hotel) don't expect special surprises. Other wise everything else was perfect. I would stay here again"
Nov 2018,20,What a pity,"A wonderful location but the hotel and services are really poor Even the reviews requests are quite strange I have to write minimum 200 characters ...The room smelled dump and humidity the restaurant quality really poor for a 5 starsWe payed for full board but we didn’t have 2 lunches there, when we did check out any discount has been applied"
Nov 2018,50,Super hotel,"Hotel in a stunning beachfront location with direct access to beach. Beautiful entrance and reception with lovely ,friendly helpful staff. Was upgraded to a suite which was huge, spotlessly clean and well equipped with two bathrooms, two televisions, two balconies, a fridge and great sofa and table. Breakfast was included and just fantastic with wide selection of super fresh and super tasty food. Great outdoor pools and indoor pool .All in all MAGNIFICENT!"
Nov 2018,30,Not 5 star amenities,"It is a nice hotel, but it lacks character, apart from the pools and beach their isnt much to do in the day and the night entertainment is almost non existant. we went to the hotel next door which had much more entertaiment laid on.( and the drinks and food were much cheaper )"
Nov 2018,30,Wonderful hotel and breakfast but room service is debatable,"Room was comfortable, breakfast wonderful, didn't change the bin liner in bathroom for 4 day until we asked, forgot towels in room 2 times. Location with private beach was excellent. When we arrived you didn't have our booking, a mix up between hotel and agent, we had paid in advance, the employee at front desk was so upset, after sorting the problem avoided us for the rest of our stay. All others at front desk were most kind and helpful."
Nov 2018,20,Very Disappointed ,We booked a one bedroom apartment to stay here as it looked amazing & had fantastic reviews. It was booked in September & we emailed to explain this holiday was to celebrate our 40th  wedding anniversary in November & that we would really appreciate if we could be allocated a nice apartment for this special holiday. We received a reply email very promptly saying that they would do there best to allocate an apartment with a good view & location & we were confident that with over 100 apartments they would find us a nice one. We arrived on 1/11/18 and were extremely disappointed when we were shown our apartment. It was at the back of the site very close to a main road & behind an Italian restaurant. A first floor apartment with a tiny balcony looking directly onto the back of some other apartments and a service road. The apartment was clean & well decorated & has everything we needed but having looked round the site we feel we have probably got one of the less desirable apartments. A shame when it is such a special holiday.
Nov 2018,40,Families welcome,"It is a huge property with lots of activities for kids from Kids Club to swimming pools. The private access to the beach is also convenient. One can spend most of their vacation chilling around the resort and not get bored. The apartments are not in the same building as the main reception, restaurant etc but a short walking distance away. Breakfast spread is nice. The staff is very freindly and most of them are ready to help. They even arranged for a surprise drink(apple juice) and cake for my child's birthday. Definitely recommend for a laid back holiday"
Nov 2018,50,A huge thank you for taking amazing care of my parents,"I've booked my parents stay at Grande Real Santa Eularia Resort for 3 nights in September.  They had an amazing time staying at the resort.  A few highlights:1) my dad fell and injured his leg at the train station and ended up with stitches.  The staff was very kind to them, helped them with booking uber to the doctor and to town.2) staff helped them with charger for the phone3) breakfast buffet was amazing4) rooms were great--large5) beautiful pool area6) the beach was amazing and short walk. A special thank you to Rafael at reception.  He was very helpful and kind to my parents.We all hope to visit again soon."
Nov 2018,50,Family holiday,"Great resort, and great value if you pick the time of year carefully. 2 bed apartments are great, pools fantastic and amazing views to sea - beach bar is a perfect spot too - all in all it's great and we're hoping to go back"
Nov 2018,50,Overall very good except 1 male chef on omelette duty kept ignoring guests and had to be called a number of times,"Only complaint was male chef on omelette duty kept ignoring clients and had to be called a number of times for service. Also all staff should wear name tags in a 5 star hotel. Location great, but Evening entertainment was dreadful, and consisted of guitar players playing their own unknown music, awful,awful and awful"
Nov 2018,40,Hotel stay for a wedding,"Absolutely fantastic wedding venue.  The only negative comment about the hotel is the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room, which I expected as standard, especially as this is a five star hotel."
Oct 2018,50,Outstanding hotel,Outstanding location and outstanding service. The beach was breathtaking. The staff in particular Ines and Elizabeth were excellent. Our one bed self catering apartment had excellent facilities.Temperature were 24 degrees so had swim in the heated outdoor pools! Will definitely return!Will definitely come back when it’s bit warmer.
Oct 2018,30,"Average hotel, poor service & definitely not five stars","My husband and I came here for 9 nights mid-Sept and overall had a very relaxing holiday. The weather was perfect and the hotel was next to a beach which was really lovely. The hotel rooms are way below 5-Star standard and the hotel staff service is underwhelming. Overall staff didn’t go above and beyond, not super friendly, food overpriced in the hotel and most definitely not a 5-Star hotel.Albufeira itself is not a location I would return to. A few too many people on holiday just to get pissed drunk which takes away from the feeling you’re in a different country. If clubs are not your thing, don’t come to albufeira. If you’re looking for a 5-star hotel with 5-star service, don’t choose this one."
Oct 2018,50,Great location next to the beach and good quality resort,"good hotel and resort close to new town and a stones throw from the beach...we enjoyed our stay with our daughter. nice and friendly staff and good amenities in the resort. only thing rooms could have been better cleaned as we saw that our balcony was not hoovered regularly. also though we did not specifically ask but were hoping for a couple of sheet changes in the 8 day stay, we had."
Oct 2018,50,October Break,"An excellent hotel in a beautiful location with pleasant, efficient and friendly staff. We stayed half board and found the breakfast to be 1st class with a good variety, a perfect start to the day. Evening meal was a little sparse on variety, dissapointed by having to pay for water with the meal and in the room. Only one restuarant available in the evening which was again disappointing."
Oct 2018,50,Family trip in October,"What I liked:Hotel location (on the beach). Size - it's a good size to walk around and have space.Heated pool is perfect for October.Spa!Kids club - they were very friendly and my daughters (5-6) wanted to go every day.Food was very good - though we only really tried the sandwiches at lunch (no breakfast or dinner buffets, we ate breakfast in the apartment and had dinner in nearby restaurants).THe only thing I disliked was the bed mattress which was much too hard!"
Oct 2018,50,Costa del Folk Festival 2nd visit - see you again next year,"Fantastic Hotel, super design and layout, great food, and wonderful helpful staff.  We had a Seaview Room again this year, it was comfortable, clean, and the daily service was impeccable.  Giant and really comfortable double bed.  Amazing breakfast buffet and a good evening dinner buffet.  As a vegetarian I had no trouble finding enough to eat without having to ask for any special treatment.  Sometimes I pinched the vegetables from the meat dishes as well ! The choice of fresh fruit at Breakfast and Dinner was excellent.  Good choice of desserts.  There were queues for the restaurant at peak times but it's difficult to cope with 700 people all wanting eat at the same time in the break between the various activities and the evening concert but I thought the waiting time was quite reasonable.  We didn't mind sharing a table as we met some interesting people this way.  The young staff manning the pool bars spoke excellent English and very extremely friendly and efficient - a real credit to the Hotel and the image it gave of the Portuguese people.  The bar prices very reasonable considering that it's a 5 star hotel. We are already booked for Costa del Folk again next year."
Oct 2018,50,Excellent stay with top level service and spotless apartments,"Had a 4 night stay here - this really was a 5 star resort (not like others we have stayed in), from the service to the apartment from the moment we got there to the moment we left.We stayed in a 2 bed apartment. These are normally forgotten about, outdated and neglected, but that wasn't the case here. They were clean, fresh and spotless.Notified reception of a leaking shower head and loose towel rail on one of the mornings and they were rectified straight away.Great place, would definitely recommend!"
Oct 2018,50,Paul Claffey Tour,My wife and I really enjoyed our stay in Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and will definitely return again. Staff were lovely and all very helpful. One complaint is that the soft drinks and water was expensive in function room. Hotel is in a wonderful location
Oct 2018,50,Fantastic holiday,"Just to clarify, our holiday was part of the Costa del Folk festival 2018. This is where a holiday company, Enjoy Travel, runs a folk festival in the sun featuring some of the U.K.'s best folk artists. Our festival included Show of Hands and Fishermen's' Friends. Your holiday experience here might not have the same level of entertainment but the hotel features will probably be the same.First of all, super design and layout, fantastic sea views, great food, wonderful, helpful staff. Try speaking a little Portuguese and your efforts will be rewarded.I'm the difficult one being a diabetic vegetarian....however, there were clearly labelled vegetarian and vegan options most nights. Breakfast was never a problem for a vegetarian as there was always plenty of choice. Evening meals usually involved a tasty vegetarian stew or a curry. Plenty of veg to fill your plate. My holiday became complete on day three when I found the sugar free jam stand.The pool area featured heated and unheated pools. My wife assured me though that as warm as the heated pool was, the sea was actually warmer. (October). You can walk through the grounds to a wonderful, safe beach. There are two bars / cafe around the pool area. Again, lunchtime vegetarian options are available. There is another cafe/bar area at the bottom end of the hotel complex near the beach. This is called Bar Atlantica. Again, interesting vegetarian options were available. This is a stunning location. I've added it to my list of favourite places in the world to enjoy a coffee. Trust me, sitting here with a coffee, listening to and watching the waves rolling in.....wonderful.Book a room with a sea view. Apartments are also available here."
Oct 2018,40,Music week with paul claffey tours,Hotel was fab. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Pool area was lovely and was great to have the beach nearby. Breakfast was ok and buffet was very nice. Only fault was my good cardigan went missing from my room & i notified reception & also asked the cleaner but she had no english. Unfortunately it was not located.
Oct 2018,40,Mr. H.,"Have stayed here twice before, this is an excellent hotel,great hygiene, large comfortable bedrooms, friendly helpful staff.Outside pool area very pleasant, with ample sun lounge beds,beach only yards away. If you failed to enjoy a stay here the problem probably is with you."
Oct 2018,40,Lovely clean hotel,"Very clean tidy hotel, nice friendly polite staff, excellent clean and well serviced rooms, excellent buffet and food choice, private beech and plenty of facilities. My negative gripe is the seating area is limited around the bar area, if hotel is full you can struggle to get a seat. Also company conference meetings held when we were there so lots of people buzzing around."
Oct 2018,50,Great Value,We spent 9 days here in a studio and self catered and ate out so didn’t eat in the hotel.Hotel was very clean and facilities were great.Only minor gripe was rooms being cleaned in late afternoon when most people want to be able to relax or prepare for the evening .Only a minor thing though otherwise first class with excellent friendly staff
Oct 2018,40,Costa del folk,We stayed at this hotel because we were attending a folk festival. The hotel was very accommodating and we really enjoyed our stay.We stayed on after the festival for a few days and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.
Oct 2018,40,Recent visit for folk festival,"This is an excellent hotel which we have visited for the second time. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was lovely with great air con (which was needed given the heat) A great hotel for the Costa del folk festival. However, the food was a buffet service which necessitated ridiculously long queues and the food was set out in an unhelpful way, e'g the soup was in the middle of the salad and 'hot' food. The menu was pretty good but the hot food was just not hot, luke warm and sometimes inedible because of this. If they could sort these things out they would get 5 stars but....."
Oct 2018,50,Autumn Trip 2018,"We travelled to the hotel for a short mid-term break, it is a venue close to our heats as we were married there in 2010. Wonderful vista and outdoor facilities by the Mediterranean sea, beautiful backdrop for young family time out."
Oct 2018,30,2nd visit for Costa del Folk,"Apartment spacious and comfortable with good air conditioning. Cleaned efficiently every day. Pleasant surroundings close to good beach. If only the kitchen could provide hot food, it would be excellent, but is unpalatable at tepid temperatures."
Oct 2018,40,Great location and service in this 5 * hotel,"A well run 5* hotel in a great location . Everything you need in this hotel, beach front and lots of space. Staff well trained and helpful. We were at a folk festival held at the hotel. Food quality was excellent, though provided to a budget. Great breakfast available outside, a must on a warm day."
Oct 2018,40,Mostly positive comments.,Nice and polite reception workers are always happy to assist. Our apartment was not new as in the pictures but it was serviced very good by the housekeeping workers. A noise did bother us but not too much. Food is good in the hotel.
Oct 2018,50,Excellent,Excellent stay yet again our third time to stay here and we will definitely be back 😊. We even got complimentary champagne and a room upgrade for my birthday. Staff are always so helpful and the guy who checked us in was so friendly and nice! 5stars all round 🤩
Oct 2018,30,too bad,"everything was in hot plates. Nothing baked a la minute and that for 5 stars. for 5 stars do you expect a bit more, especially since the restaurant was not completely full. Because the kitchen was open to all long remained 18:00 's hour and was thus no longer so hot."
Oct 2018,40,Relax in luxury out of town,"Good 5 star with all the extras, apartments and hotel rooms. 40 minutes walk to Albufeira or free shuttle bus. Good sandy beaches. Firm beds. Not all facilities open as end of season. Good sized apartments, well equipped. Many English TV channels"
Oct 2018,50,Costa del folk,"Good comfortable hotel, good food, excellent staff. Great location fronting onto the beach. Need to be reasonably mobile because of different levels accessed by stairs although lifts available. Outside patios for alfresco eating really good with large umbrellas if needed. Great sunsets over the ocean."
Oct 2018,40,Smashing hotel,"Really good hotel with friendly and efficient staff.We visited as part of the Costa Del Folk Portugal Festival organised by Enjoy Travel (recommended) and our party more than filled the whole hotel.The hotel was very busy with such a large party but the staff coped well.Buffet breakfast and dinner was good and the hotels beach bar was excellent for lunch.The rooms were comfortable and clean and there were also available apartments which our friends told us were good also.Grounds and swimming pools excellent with one heated pool.Highly recommended, a good four star hotel."
Oct 2018,40,Folk Festival break,"I enjoyed my stay - the staff were polite and friendly. I wish I had know how long it would take to check into our apartment. We kept being told, '10 more mins' and in the end it was 4:30 before we could get in. I didn't particularly being told where to sit for meals - it seemed to cause long queues. The food was delicious but only just warm."
Oct 2018,40,Costa del folk,"This hotel is in a beautiful spot on the sea front, with a good beach and aspect. Most of the staff are very friendly and helpful and the food is of good quality. As a vegetarian, the food choices were limited and I would imagine vegans would struggle. The free red wine that came with the evening meal was copious and surprisingly good. Also, the fresh fruit was excellent. Our room was OK and in a great position but could have been a little cleaner as the curtain linings were stained and my towel had a hole. The decor is a little tired in places but the heated hydro pool, although expensive to use, is lovely. In general. I would recommend this hotel although it wasn't quite as luxurious as I would have expected from a five star place. We were there for the week long folk festival they hosted so our experience may not be typical of the hotel when that is not on, when it isn't full or it is more peak season."
Oct 2018,50,Well run hotel with a beautiful outlook,"We recently stayed here for a Costa del Folk event. Beautiful hotel with beach access, 4 swimming pools, and very professional and friendly staff who did not seem phased at all by an entire hotel full of people arriving and booking in on tge same day, for meals in a much shortened time frame due to the event timings (including  late breakfasts due to late nights). Food was buffet style but good quality,  and staff did their  utmost to work with the Enjoy travel team and it's clients.  Our  apartment was beautiful and cleaned properly every day . The only (tiny) criticism is that the hotel should note vehicle registration numbers- we had a note left on our windscreen which we did not find until we were leaving - and by then no one knew why it had been left there."
Oct 2018,50,Excellent stay for music event,"Highly recommend this hotel with superb staff.  Everything from the general areas, bedrooms and pools area is kept very clean. Bedrooms are spacious with balconies.  Good choices at the buffet breakfast and also for evening dinner.  Will be returning."
Oct 2018,50,First Class Hotel,"Reception, facilities and food were exceptional during stay with beach access direct from hotel making hotel location ideal. Stayed in apartment which was well equipped and cleaned each day. Management and staff were absolutely fabulous and nothing was to much bother."
Oct 2018,50,5 start,"Fantastic hotel. very Clean, top service. staff were professional throughout the week. the food was great. lots of choice of activities and views to die for. Great beach at the bottom for sunbathing!!"
Oct 2018,50,Great hotel,Great place to stay. Near beach and town. The apartments are comfortable and plenty of room. The staff are friendly and easy to talk to. Love the walk down to the beach from the hotel and on your way back up stop at the cafe for a refreshing drink or lunch.
Oct 2018,50,Great place for folk festival,"Overall very good service. I had a basic room.  Only thing I missed was tea making facilities, but otherwise very good and very comfortable bed.  Location a little out of town, but a courtesy bus was available, so not really an issue.  Enjoyed my stay."
Oct 2018,50,Costa Del Folk Portugal,"What an incredible week that was. Live music concerts, ceilidh dance and late night song sessions (organised by yours truly - thanks to those who attended these it made it fun to run them. We even continued them at Faro Airport departures lounge due to the 1 and 1/2 hour delay). The Aqua ceilidh was a hoot; can't wait for the videos of this."
Oct 2018,40,Lovely Hotel.,We were in the hotel for a week. It is a beautiful hotel with amazing views. Our room was amazing and had super sea views. The only disappointing thing is the food in the restaurant. It isn't up to scratch for such an otherwise outstanding 5* hotel. This is disappointing as we didn't really want to leave the hotel but had to. The menu hasn't really changed since our visit last year. Please do something about the toasters !!
Oct 2018,50,Fabulous Hotel,"We have just returned from a weeks' stay at the Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa and we will definitely be back.  The hotel was very modern and clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly, especially Fernando at Reception and Antonio in the Bar.  The rooms are very spacious and the beds are extremely comfortable."
Oct 2018,50,Paul Claffey week,"The hotel was excellent but I think you are losing out by not having an evening meal  on the menu that Irish / English people like eg steaks, roasts fish potatoe and vegetables.   A large portion of the group were eating out.   Look at the menu in ""Martins"" for example."
Oct 2018,40,Lovely stay at Grande Real,"We stayed for 10 days in September 2018. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay though we were unable to use all of the hotel facilities because we had hired bicycles for the duration of our stay. Breakfast was good, the room was comfortable, we slept well and room service meals were of good quality - we booked B&B as we preferred to check out the old town of an evening.The staff were extremely helpful and assisted us by storing the expensive bicycles we had hired safely overnight. The hotel is very close to the beach although access could be a little tricky for anyone who is not fully mobile.We look forward to returning to Albufeira and would certainly consider staying at the  Grande Real again. The regular coach service from the hotel door to the town was very useful, we just took a taxi back if it got late.Overall, a great holiday."
Oct 2018,40,Costa Del Folk again!,"Our return visit to this hotel for the folk festival has been a better experience this time around in that we didn't get ill on day 5 which I put down to the better quality of food and the hotel overcoming problems of mass catering outside We had an apartment again which was nearer to the hotel entrance and therefore noiser, but the room was pretty well insulated.In the apartment, nearly everything worked except the freezer door was broken and water from the freezer compartment filled the upper shelf, the patio doors were broken on one side and the remote for the bedroom tv didn't work - I call these 1st world problems. The water at this hotel is safe to drink from the taps and so you won't need to lug water from the mini market.on day 1.There is a spa here which we didn't use and an in door pool as well as multiple out door pools - 1 heated and the remainder ice cold.Prices here are the same as you would expect in a UK hotel with a reasonable pedigree.The hotel needs a maintenance programme during the winter months as the granite path and road is starting to break up and health and safety is not a priority here - a fall on this surface would be pretty serious for anybody of any age.The staff here are friendly and efficient at their jobs - it makes a difference to whether you enjoy staying at a hotel or not I think."
Oct 2018,20,Definitely not a five star hotel,"We stayed here in a one bedroom apartment between the 11th-20th September with a 14 month year old daughter. Our apartment was located next to the bar of the neighbouring hotel. Every night there was loud music or terrible karoke, which was a nightmare for us having such a young child who was constantly woken by it. We complained on more than one occasion but nothing was ever really done.Upon entering the apartment, we noticed a strong musty smell coming from the bedroom.After alerting the hotel to this odour, they tried to get rid of it using some kind of chemical cleaning agent that was even worse than the original smell.The apartment was spacious and clean, though the décor was a little dated. The pool behind the reception area was really nice as were the views. The hotel also had a very nice beach, which they provide towels for. The kid's club was a nice bonus. The location is good."
Oct 2018,40,holiday,the holiday was great but our experince at  faro was a disaster  you can ask any of the holliday makers so that would put me off going againyours tony breslin as for the hotel it was very nice and comfy
Oct 2018,50,Great hotel,"Our second stay with Costa del Folk. Apartment great, bed very comfortable. We had lunch at the beach cafe every day ( beach is really lovely) Staff are fantastic, really helpful and efficient. A special mention for the young woman who cleaned our apartment, she did a first class job."
Oct 2018,50,Beautiful resort hotel,"Beautiful resort hotel, friendly staff and atmosphere, very clean and modern rooms. The beach was just 5 minutes walk away and the nearby towns just 10-15 minute drive (regular free shuttle bus to old and new town) Bars, restaurants, night life, kids activities, something for everyone. We really enjoyed our stay here and will definitely visit again!"
Oct 2018,50,Family holiday,"I have stayed here 2016,2017 and 2018 and each year the hotel got better and better.Lovely upgrades done each year. The hotel is in a perfect location in the new town with shops, pubs, food places all beside the hotel. The strip is only a 5 minute walk away, the old town is 5 mins away in a taxi ( costs €5 )I will 100% be back in 2019."
Oct 2018,50,Brillant experience,"From start to finish, it was an amazing experience.  Staff so kind and so helpful throughout, a really enjoyable stay in a very relaxing environment.   The buggy back and from the apartment was a lovely experience. The hotel itself was just fabulous. Ten out of ten."
Oct 2018,40,FOOD QUALITY,After one nights eating in the restaurant the quality variety and presentation was so bad that we had to get our money back on a meal package we bought. 5 people and two trips to reception the staff were unable to do a refund via the card machine which is unbelievable! Eventually they gave me cash back. Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. Martins Restaurant the closest one was reaping the benefits as it was packed every night. Excellent shuttle bus service!
Oct 2018,40,irish country music week,"Hotel was lovely, great staff, I had a one bed apartment and it was lovely. my only complaint was the food, very poor for  5 star hotel. Cleaner was brilliant, washed my coffee cup and whisky glass every day, I could not ask for anymore"
Oct 2018,50,Beautiful location and hotel,Stayed at hotel for second time as part of a country music festival didn't think they could improve on facilities from last year but this year got a ground floor room and it was out of this world the comfort of opening the patio out onto your own green grass terrace was amazing.  Staff are always obliging local taxi firm are prompt and reasonably priced.
Oct 2018,50,Amazing,Have been coming for the last 5 years on the paul claffey trip. It is the highlight of my year coming back each year.  Love everything about the hotel . The hotel is bright and airy with brilliant views . Check in is always so smooth and organised . Reception  staff are friendly and go out of their way to make sure everything is right. Rooms are spacious and immaculate and keep really well. Love the pool area where you can chill out and have a drink without having to move whilst looking at fabulous views.  Food is top class. The staff in jiggy jig bar are so friendly and enter into the celebrations . Looking forward to next year already
Oct 2018,50,holiday in portugal,a real gem of a hotel excellent price. service great. definitely be back.room was fantastic with a real comfortable bed...food and drink prices very reasonable my only complaint if you could call it one was the swimming pool was cold but once in fine
Oct 2018,50,Excellent choice 👌,"Excellent hotel, excellent food and drink. Great place for families with kids. 4 pools to choose from. Great kids club. Easy access to the beach from the hotel. Lovely restaurant by the seaside to have a drink and watch the sunset.Highly recommended."
Oct 2018,50,Fantastic hotel ideally located to the strip and beach,Hotel done out to a good standard. Ideally located to the strip about a 10 minute walk and only a few mins to nearest bars and restaurants. Hotel very nice rooms done out to a high standard. Food on site good. Didn't have breakfast but bar snacks very good. Pool area lovely spacious and the hotel as a whole very clean
Oct 2018,50,Fantastic stay,Stayed here for WMO tournament and it was a lovely place to stay! The staff are very friendly and my room was clean and comfortable The breakfast food was amazing and a large veriaty! The beach is close by and clean! And overall experience was amazing
Oct 2018,40,Well situated,"Overall very good, a fair way to any bars. The food and drink is quite expensive. All the staff were helpful and friendly. The free bus was always on time, the only poor thing was that the last one was at 6.25. Not much of a problem as you could get a taxi from Albufeira back for about 6.5 euros ."
Oct 2018,50,Amazing place,"Yet another wonderful stay, 4th time here, this time with my 2 year old daughter. Incredible place, highly recommended. Can’t wait to get back next year. Holds a special place with my girlfriend and I, the scenery is spectacular. Little gem"
Oct 2018,50,Great vacation,We had a great time at this resort and I would highly recommend this place to my family and friends..the staff were very friendly and helpful..we enjoyed walks along the beach and sitting by your beautiful pool..loved it and would go back for sure
Oct 2018,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort,"Excellent hotel, staff were so pleasant and helpful, food was divine, courtesy air conditioned coach to take you in and out of old town, beach was brilliant, we traveled as a family of 10, everyone enjoyed especially surprise birthday treat, one complaint only, hotel taxi company leaves a lot to be desired,one particular driver was rude, insulting and well out of order"
Oct 2018,50,Girls trip away,Stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment with breakfast .Everything was top class -even the weather .Booked directly with the hotel -is a tad on the expensive side .Taxis into Albufeira old town about 8 euros .Hotel in a fantastic position right onto a beautiful beach .
Oct 2018,50,excellent hotel,A really good hotel which ticks all the boxes.Staff very friendly and very courteous. Food very good in all Restaurants.Rooms well cleaned.Air conditioning very effective.Hotel has a lovely view over the Bay
Oct 2018,50,Fabulous Hotel,Fabulous hotel fantastic location with amazing sea views. The staff were lovely. Hotel is on the outskirts of Albufera so if you want to be in the thick of things then maybe not for you. We loved it and the hotel runs a regular courtesy bus service to Albufera old town. Would highly recommend this hotel.
Sep 2018,50,Competition holiday,"We were in your hotel in portugal with the world Martialarts championships.  The venue was amazing, brilliant views, right near the beach.  Friendly staff,  very clean, great breakfast with champagne,  we will definately return"
Sep 2018,50,Amazing Hotel,Really great hotel in a beautiful location. All staff were extremely nice and helpful. Apartment was lovely and had everything we needed. Food at the hotel was good quality. Would highly recommend this hotel!
Sep 2018,50,Just returned after good holiday,"We asked for a sea view room which was quiet and were happy enough with our room. There was a noisy party one night after a wedding but to be fair it stopped at about eleven and one or two noisy guests around, but that happens everywhere and is not the hotels fault. We stayed breakfast and evening meal and while some of the food was not to our taste we always ended up having enough to eat. The breakfasts were kept hot which does not always happen at hotels abroad and there was a good choice. The rooms were perhaps a little dated but again this is not unusual and we were perfectly happy with ours and we found our bed very comfortable. Also pleased to have a sheet as well as a quilt, as most nights this was all we needed and blankets provided for if the weather was cold so all options covered. We have been cold when abroad at night, if the weather is bad. We went to a local supermarket for water etc as the hotel prices were much higher and also some days for our midday meal. We liked the setting of the hotel and would recommend it. The staff were all very nice and helpful and also seemed happy in their work. The only real fault we could find is that while the hotel is kept spotlessly clean the pool area does not seem to be cleaned much, if at all. We have seen people sweeping and even washing down these areas at four star hotels, yet there was no sign of any cleaning around the pool areas here. There were items such as ice lolly sticks lying around and we noticed them left there all the time we stayed."
Sep 2018,50,Santa Eulalia Hotel and Spa,"Changed to this Horel after reading very bad reviews of hotel already booked.  So glad we did!  Excellent location, very clean, neat and tidy.  Very comfy beds, plenty of hot water and good water pressure.  Adequate kitchenette, good  size fridge.  Small balcony but did have sea view.  Weather very hot (September) so very grateful not to be on sunny side of Hotel.  Quiet yet close enough to restaurants, The Strip, beaches, walks.  Very good transport links for those who needed it -  tuktuks, taxis, local buses, etc.  Highly recommended"
Sep 2018,40,Refurbishment needed!,"This was our 6th or 7th time staying at this hotel& for the 1st time we had small critism about it. We stayed in the apartments and find these brilliant but I think they could do with some upgrading. The decor, fabrics are there forever & this year it showed for us unfortunately. Our couches, cushions and wardrobes all had a bit of a mouldy smell ! We were really surprised at this as we have never found this before & really think this is not 5 star standard & necessary  to upgrade! Also our correct amount of bathroom towels weren't given each day & I had to ask accommodation for them. Lastly on the accommodation, the beds are really uncomfortable ! Please change them!!!The final thing is a suggestion for the hotel. I suggested it last year also but obviously wasn't looked at! A laundry room would be very handy on the premises with some washing machines. I travelled with my 2 small children & would have found one great!Overall the hotel, service , food and facilities are excellent but things started to deteriorate this year for us unfortunately."
Sep 2018,40,Very good ,"As a hotel area this place is great. Beautiful location with a range of rooms and apartments. Nice pool area or a pathway down to the beach with the usual jet ski, paddle boats, sailing etc. You also have a games room, tennis courts and gym as well as a spa.If you want to get your own food there are a couple of mini markets nearby which will give you some of the basics as well as a number of restaurants which are within a few metres to a couple of miles to the hotel which most are aimed at the tourist rather than the locals.This is a great place if money is not an issue and you don't mind staying on site or using it as a base to travel away from to visit other parts of the region.We visited for an event along with a number of friends. Although this is not my thing for a family visit as normally we look to budget to our limits and try to look at an area with more traditional local restaurants and location it is however a recommended place to try."
Sep 2018,50,Grand Real Santa Eulalia Resort and spa,We have stayed in Albufeira on several occasions and have not found accomodation to better this. This was our second stay in the Grande Real Santa Eulalia resort and spa. The staff can not do enough for you and any minor problems encountered have been rectified immediately. We have stayed in both the hotel complex and apartments and both are of a very high standard. Can not wait to return
Sep 2018,30,Ransacked & Robbed in this Supposed 5 Star Hotel ,Very disappointed in the security of this supposed 5 star hotel. We were Broken into and Robbed of our valued possessions with the Hotel accepting no responsibility for our loss other than offering drinks and a meal. At this stage we could not stomach a meal! Could not believe Police were told that there is no Video surveillance  for the area near our room which is in a secluded area. We were devistated by this event which had a huge impact on an overall trip to Spain & Portugal to celebrate my wife's coming 60th.
Sep 2018,50,Very comfortable and relaxing hotel,"I stayed here based on a recommendation and wasn't disappointed. From the arrival and check-in to the quality of the food, pool area and staff I would definitely recommend this hotel for a wide variety of people, from couples to families and solo travellers. The staff were excellent and all aspects were catered for."
Sep 2018,40,Chill Out Time,"Stayed here wk ending 23 rd sept, myself and partner.Everything in the hotel is great, just a little niggle, fried breakfast was,nt to good, bacon greasy, sausages were dry n spicy , but the rest of the buffet more than makes up for it, great choice of everything else.Also room was cleaned and no bath towels were left, so asked maid to leave some off, and she must,ve forgot, had to ring reception to get some delivered to our room. Fridge was, nt on or if it was the water was, nt cold when i took it out!1  other thing, i think the hotel settee, s in the foyer need renewing , you sit and sink into them, so time they went.Over all a lvly stay!"
Sep 2018,40,Good Stay,"Great front desk employes. Ocean view and a big room but a little bit out dated. All the staff are very kind and the main restaurant offers you a good variety of choice. Would come back again, for sure."
Sep 2018,50,Very pleased!,"Very nice service, beautiful, stylish and clean hotel. The food was good and the view was great. Also the room was fantastic and very clean. The service was also great, very kind and helpful. Well done!"
Sep 2018,30,Hotel Grande Real Santa Eulalia,"A nice hotel with lovely pools, just a shame the outlying pool bars were not open (and there was no waiter service), so there is quite a trek to the main bar.We were upgraded to a 1-bed self-catering apartment room 537 - which was lovely.  There is a nice, sunny living room/diner/kitchen; fully equipped with everything you needed including tea towels.  However the bedroom was very dark and (after a few days), started to smell of, and feel, damp.  As we were quite a few days into our 7-day break, we did not report this at the time – but thinking back, we should have.The buffet breakfasts were typical continental breakfast, with everything you expect to see – super."
Sep 2018,50,1st stay,Super hotel loved  every minute of our stay Special birthday treat from management super surprise. We would like to thank all hotel staff for a wonderful holiday We would love to return sometime in the near future
Sep 2018,30,Nice hotel but won’t be back to Albufeira,"If you find yourself in Albufeira, I’d recommend staying at the Real Grande. We had a good stay here, the facilities are good and the staff very friendly. However, we found that Albufeira, and the Algarve in general, has sold its soul to mass tourism in all the wrong ways. Drugs and drunks everywhere. The hotel is good but because of the rest of our holiday, I doubt we’ll be back."
Sep 2018,50,Simply Amazing,"I cannot fault this hotel, service was spot on, immaculate, staff could not do enough to help, pool areas amazing and never had trouble getting a sun lounger, breakfast options was great, opted to eat out in evenings but all meals we had inside the restaurant were great, very child friendly and had the most enormous kids club, loved this hotel cannot wait to get back there"
Sep 2018,50,Lovely hotel,We booked for a two week holiday but due to a bereavement in the family we had to fly home after 9 days but the time we spent in the hotel was excellent. From The reception staff to the serving staff and everyone else we were treated brilliantly. And the help we received when we explained we had to leave early was exemplary. We will be back .
Sep 2018,30,"5* Staff, 3* Hotel","Grande Real Santa Eulália Resort & Hotel Spa Albufeira 5* Staff - 3* Hotel 616475707 I must start by saying we were satying in a self catering suite so I can't comment on the main hotel rooms.Our suite was very tired, flaking walls, poor decoration, poor drainage,etc; however it was cleaned every day to a good standard, towels and bed linen changed when required.All the staff we met were brilliant. The grounds of the hotel need some t.l.c.in places and as I have said it just looks a bit run down, so only 3 stars from me."
Sep 2018,40,Very good and quiet but town a bit too far to walk to!,What let the hotel down in my opinion was that they didn't give much info about hotel restaurant locations times etc or detail of the spa and when I went down to the spa I was told it was €20 to use the indoor pool!Drinks were a bit more expensive and the nearest bar outside was 1km hilly walk although 2 nice restaurants just outside that did sell drinks/cocktails with/after meals.They supplied free transport to old town and new town (the strip!) But only every couple of hours and last one was 7:20pm! So had to get tut-tut back €10-16. The strip is noisy and over crowded - really for youngsters only although had a couple of nice cocktails there!Saying all that the room was great and we were given upgrade to a sea view which was fantastic. The hotel was quiet and no sunbed issues. The beach was not private and did get busy especially when the tide was in! Nice walk across rocks when tide in for other beaches some very quiet and secluded.
Sep 2018,30,No more than a 3.5*,"We've just returned from a family holiday to Portugal where we stayed at this hotel. We were downgraded from a resort room to an apartment room. The reason that we chose a resort room was to be closer to the facilities within the hotel. The apartment that we were allocated was the furthest away from the resort as possible. When we questioned this we were told that there were no other rooms as there was a wedding party and a large cycling group that had booked into the hotel at the same time. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and the hotel is OK. The main pools in the resort are heated but the pools closer to the apartments were freezing cold. The breakfast buffet was excellent, definitely worth having this if you want to stay here.The beach is a 10 minutes walk away but there are a number of stairs to negotiate if like us you have a baby and a pram/buggy this can be tricky.The children's play area is a nice extra benefit, we spent a little time there on our final day.There are a number of restaurants a short walk away. (Beware that the area is very hilly!). The food was very nice at these (look out for the tourist menus). There are only two restaurants in the main hotel for evening meals, one being a buffet (charging €30+ per person).  Again we were unfortunate that the other restaurant, which was advertised as a burger bar, was shut for the two occasions that we wanted to use it for the cycle group. The other three bars only served food till 5:30. We are vegetarian so food options within the hotel were very limited.We didn't really have the chance to use the spa facilities.It is definitely not deserving of a 5* rating though, 3.5* is closer to the mark. Having the option we probably wouldn't stay here again in the future, it really lacked the wow factor."
Sep 2018,40,Not as good,"Spent ten nights here from 3rd September , Hotel was spotlessly clean , staff very friendly,especially the barmen, Only grumbles were rooms not cleaned most days until after 4pm , and the food was not really up to  expectations , Very repetitive and bland stews and over cooked meat! The location was very good but there is very little to do in Albufeiria except eat and drink!! The beach is down a very steep hill and not for elderly or people with walking difficulties. The entertainment was a joke! Karaoke and a singer (same man) a definite throwback to the sixties as was he💤  Portugal seemed to be stuck in a time warp with musicians playing loudly in restaurants and very old fashioned. I don't think that we will be returning anytime soon, but if you like hot sunny lazy days then this is for you. This hotel is ideal for b&b or self catering I would not advise the half board option because of the food! it is cheaper to eat out."
Sep 2018,20,Disappointing,"Spent 2 nights at this hotel. Was a little disappointed considering all the great reviews I thought this would be a great hotel to stay at. ALOT of minor issues that ruined our experience. First off rooms are very dated, beach was dirty and over crowded. My fiancé and I had just came from a real 5* hotel in Vilamoura and we were newly engaged therefore we were celebrating. It was impossible to get a bottle opener and 2 champagne glasses for some reason. I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that we were pulling teeth to get 2 cups. We never got a straight answer as to why we couldn't get them even though I was willing to pay. We ended up going to the bar in the lobby and they told me they were not authorized to give me PLASTIC cups????? they also do not provide any ice on the floors or let alone anywhere in this hotel. Another issue was they told me they only had 1 wine bottle opener and it was in use so I was out of luck. Luckly my sister was down the street in a hostel that provided more things that this hotel didn't. We paid about $380 a night to stay here, my sister paid $100 at a hotel and had a great experience. They have a lot to work on considering these are basic items. Would not return to this hotel nor would I recommend it to anyone.**Forgot to mention our bed sheets had blood on them when we arrived."
Sep 2018,40,Enjoyable stay at this hotel,"Overall we enjoyed our stay. However I was disappointed that there was no complimentary tea/coffee/snacks in our apartment. I was very pleased with the reception staff, in particular the ladies who helped me sort out my flight issue."
Sep 2018,40,Great hotel. Lacking in the food department,"Stayed here for 5 nights from sep 9th, really enjoyed our stay, hotel was lovely and location was perfect with direct access to a lovely beach. Our only fault was the price, quality and variety of food, in particular the buffet lunch is way over priced."
Sep 2018,40,The good times of the 5* Hotel are over,"Visually everything looks OK but on closer inspection, see Headline. Restaurant achieves quality grade 3. We participated once in the evening buffet, per person 32 €, very proud price for the offered Quality"
Sep 2018,50,Great hotel😀,"We love that hotel, staff is so friendly and ready to help from the front desk throug restaurant staff and housekeeping service. Food delicious in your restaurants, good choice for breakfast. We gave average for sleeping quality only because our room(214) was just beside laundry so we could hear machines working. Thank you to all of you. We'll be back."
Sep 2018,50,Holiday,"Was great, services fantastic and we will be back. Friendly staff , very organize and clean, some days in breakfast was a bit busy but 5 mins wait and was fine. Beach is clean and good services with sunbeds and towels from the hotel prefect."
Sep 2018,50,Amazing venue for Wedding,"We had our wedding here and stayed for a week. The hotel is fantastic and staff are excellent. The day itself was perfect, from the set up, the food, the venue etc we couldn’t have wished for better. Special mention for the two wedding co-ordinaters Angela & Patricia who were so helpful from the day we first visited the hotel to view it right through until we checked out. Highly recommended hotel for a relaxing holiday or wedding abroad."
Sep 2018,40,May holiday,"We returned to this hotel in May this year and have now stayed 6 times. The hotel is lovely and staff are usually happy to please. The hotel is situated on the beach which is the perfect location. Unfortunatley in May there was a conference [ this in not unusual) but I do feel that the holidaymakers were treated appallingly; we were classed as less important and for this reason we chose to go to another location in August. It infuriated us as we have previously have had wonderful holidays here. At breakfast and other mealtimes the people attending the conference were treated  better and served prior to holidaymakers, this truly is not on when you are paying good money to stay there.( I was told by a female restaurant manager quite firmly that I would have to wait while she seated the conference attendees before I could be attended to ) It has certainly tarnished my memories of this hotel and I am not sure that we will return.The hotel is well situated near Albufeira and there is a shuttle bus provided from the hotel into the town. There are lots of bars and restaurants and you can make your holiday as busy or as relaxing as you wish. The rooms are clean and spacious.  The staff are obliging in all areas and try their best to help where they can."
Sep 2018,50,Great Resort,"only pro for all the resort, one little thing to add is regarding the breakfast variety (it is the same products in every morning).but it is not a thing to wory about because you have where to choose from."
Sep 2018,50,Family wedding ,"We attended here for a wedding , this place has the wow factor . As we didn't stay here I can't comment on the hotel that way , but from what we saw of the service from staff was impeccable.  The views from here are beautiful , with private access to the beach . It was a beautiful place to get married , from the service to the meal and evening reception , everything the hotel did was Perfect."
Sep 2018,50,Great Short Break,An excellent hotel with friendly staff and perfect location next to the beach. Free shuttle bus into town so the best of both worlds.Great Value for money for a top hotel. Nice restaurants in the hotel and nearby.
Sep 2018,50,A week in the sun,"We stayed here for a week, the weather was spot on, mid 20’s. It was our first time in this part of Portugal and the first time in this hotel. The rooms as spacious and accommodating, as is the hotel in general. There are a number of different places to eat, from beach and pool bars to cafes and restaurants. Our favourite is the fish restaurant with a sea view, in my opinion, it was the best restaurant we experienced while here, full stop. The location is perfect too, you have everything you need on site, but the new town is a 10 min walk away and the old town just a short bus transfer away. The service was excellent, with all the staff being very friendly and extremely professional at the same time. Would I recommend this place, absolutely!"
Sep 2018,40,Good location,"Nice hotel with pleasant staff, always willing to help, and good facilities. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Short distance to albufeira by foot and taxi - shuttle bus helpful too. Would recommend for families."
Sep 2018,50,Excellent!,"Perfect stay in Albufeira! We stayed for our annual Away Day in this beautiful hotel. The service was very friendly, the hotel rooms were exceptional clean and the food just great! I will definitely come back!"
Sep 2018,30,Good time by the beach!,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a work event.  The rooms are well maintained, the staff are friendly and the bar had a good selection of spirits etc.I had planned on going swimming in the pool for some exercise.  However, the pools are designed for child use only as they are circular and very shallow!The line for breakfast is crazy at points and the food at breakfast was only average."
Sep 2018,10,Rooms and beds are outdated,We got the hotel blindly on Hotwire and couldn’t believe how outdated the rooms were. Felt like a hotel in Cuba. The beds were old and the decor was terrible. We were so bummed about it that we spent the majority of our day doing activities to avoid being there. It could be a great resort if it was renovated. The staff was friendly but not enough to keep me going back on recommending. I would rather stay at a B&B
Sep 2018,50,Wedding Venue,"We were here for a wedding and it is a lovely hotel, the location of the wedding was separate from the hotel guests so no one's privacy was intruded on. A lovely hotel with friendly staff. Great setup for a wedding with nice food and facilities. This is a family-friendly hotel."
Sep 2018,50,Wow.....simply awesome,This place is surely 5 star and beyond. I was hesitant to book this hotel as some reviews said this does not deserve to be a 5 star but glad I did. This place is awesome and on the tip of the Santa Eulalia beach with beautiful views from the hotel and the restaurants. If you ask me this is even better than the other close by beaches in Albufiera. There are loads of activities and entertainment options in the resort and ideal if for a family holiday. We stayed here for 3 nights and just wish we stayed more. There is also a free shuttle to and from the old town which is definitely a plus. Would definitely return and yes 5 Stars ofcourse :)
Sep 2018,40,5 Night Stay,"Overall a good trip, employees were exceptional and very polite. Pool facilities were great, we were always able to get loungers. The variety of foods available at the pool bar was not great, only options were sandwiches, could have been better.Breakfast was awful, not much variety and the foods on offer were not of a good standard. Hotel was great only negatives were the food options!"
Sep 2018,50,Almost perfection,"Great people and service on every step, full gastronomic offer -  variety of bars and restaurants, decent breakfats, ideal for leisure and time wasting, beautifull location close to the beach, warm and cozy atmosphere. Liltle adjustments will make it place just perfect"
Sep 2018,40,Albuefera 5 night stay!,Sixth time we have visited this area and have been here before for food! This was our second visit and it was good 2 Spaghetti Bols 1 lasagne and I had Chicken Piri Piri pizza which was brilliant! Staff warm friendly and attentative reasonable price we all thoroughly enjoyed it cheers folks👍🏻
Sep 2018,50,Excellent stay!,We stayed at the hotel for 10 nights recently. The hotel is top quality - excellent staff; entertainment; food is of a high quality. Excellent spa facilities with a range of treatments. Cleanliness throughout the hotel was excellent. A real treat. We had an excellent stay and can’t wait to return.
Sep 2018,30,Beautiful resort located in s superb location but lacks essential customer service.,"I loved the architecture, the location and the beach of this resort. It's a prime location. The 'cottage/townhouse' where we stayed was nicely furnished, spacious for three adults and very clean. However, there are more negative aspects to this resort than positive. For instance, when we arrived, while staff were friendly, they lacked basic customer service skills. We were not told about activities, which restaurants are opened on which days and times, places to visit, not offered anything to drink after a long trip, etc. We had to find all that information on our own. While it's great to see young people working at the front desk, both my daughter who is 20 years old, and I found the front desk was staffed 24/7 only by young people. They were friendly and respectful but lacked the experience and the touch to handle customer service at this supposedly 5 star resort. In terms of the restaurants, they were super expensive and, again, customer service was poor. One evening we ordered a very expensive sangria which was the wrong order. We politely complained to our waitress about it but there were no apologies or an offer to replace it with the right sangria. Usually the small things are what matters the most in customer service and this was no exception during our stay at Grande Real Santa Eulalia.  The most shocking aspect of our stay was when we learnt the hotel did not provide a dish cloth/dish soap to wash our dishes at our 'cottage/townhouse.'  The stay cost me over $300 euros a night and no dish detergent?  There was no dishwasher; I didn't mind doing the dishes provided there was dish soap. We inquired about it with front desk staff but, again, there was no offer to get us some dish soap. At the end of our stay, our schedules would have allowed us to stay an extra night but it would have cost us another $300 euros plus for an additional night. With the poor customer service, and exorbitant prices, we left. Initially I picked this resort because I was also travelling with my friend, who has stayed at good resorts in Mexico and Hawaii, therefore I wanted to make sure I had picked a good resort so that she wouldn't be disappointed.  She commented several times the service couldn't compare to that of Mexican resorts. It it weren't for the beautiful beach, this would have been a really bad choice. I hope the hotel addresses these deficiencies so that it can  truly be nice place to stay and enjoy."
Sep 2018,40,"Staff brilliant, apartments need work","It was our 2nd year in this resort. Last year we stayed in the hotel and had a wonderful experience , this year we stayed in the apartments which was tired , we were plagued with a few issues in the rooms and the pool area which should not have occurred in a 5 star resort however there are some massive positives in this resort and that is the staff. Jerome the concierge is lovely and so helpful, our waiter David in the evenings was lovely as well as the lovely Silvia ( I think that was her name ) that makes the omelettes in the morning. Ines one of the managers handled a situation in a very  helpful and professional manner , however moving forward I would say to have a good experience stay in the hotel and not the apartments. In a nut shell the areas by the pools by the apartments need work as does the rooms but I do hope this resort sorts out the bits it needs too and does well as it’s got a lot of charm."
Sep 2018,50,To die for!,"There are lovely hotels there are great hotels and then there is the Grande real santa eulalia resort and hotel spa in the algarve in Portugal.Everything was perfect, the receptionists at front desk the cleaners the waiters the staff as a whole completely make your vacation a most memorable experience, along with a wonderful beach and unbelievable views , it is a resort i shall try to return too often.ps. The breakfast lunch and evening meals are of such a high standard with such a variety that you would never think of eating anywhere else.If by chance my life is cut short then i would be most happy for my ashes to be deposited in this location so that forever i may reside in utter luxury!!!!"
Sep 2018,40,More like a 4 star plus,"Great hotel but in need of updating/refurbishment.  We stayed in an apartment that had obvious signs of wear and tear over the years.  Our job needed replacing in the apartment and the decor was pretty outdated.On our first night we had some unwelcome ants as visitors 😞 whilst this wasn’t ideal and caused a major tantrum from my 7 year old who refused to sleep in the apartment, have to say the hotel were great in sorting it out as soon as we discovered the visitors and treatment was laid to stop the problem reoccurring.  We were also offered an alternative apartment that night but decided to stay where we were.  We were also visited the next day by the Real Experience manager - João Climaco who went out of his way to try and rectify the experience we had on the first night. We were offered a suite in the hotel but had to decline due to the lack of self catering facilities but were still compensated in other ways.  We accept that things go wrong on holiday it’s evitable but the biggest thing that makes a differences is how a problem is dealt with by hotel staff and I have to say the hotel dealt with it incredibly well and with great level of customer service.  We couldn’t have asked for anything more.  There are plenty of pools for both older and younger children in the resort to keep them entertained.  The only downside however with the pools near our apartment was that the bar wasn’t open and atmosphere was pretty non existent and quiet which is great if you want the piece and quiet but we wanted more of an atmosphere which you could get from the main pool area in the hotel. We were offered a nights free dinner in the buffet restaurant on one of the nights as part of our compensation but I wasn’t impressed with the food.  The variety was good but the food itself was cold and definitly not worth the €35 per person we would have been charged.Overall our stay was great despite the initial problems.  I think if the hotel upgraded its facilities and offered better food in the buffet restaurant we would visit again"
Sep 2018,30,Some observations,"1. Family room away from main hotel bit dated, various things broken (mirror), mildew odor, cobwebs by bath tub, plastic shower curtain, A/C filter needed changing - general refurb required.2. Beach not affiliated to hotel, i.e. don't expect service or a sunbed3. Several pools with good ambience 4. Service for evening buffet excellent"
Aug 2018,40,Nice hotel,"Hotel advertised with 4 restaurants, however, on our half board package we were only able to dine in the main buffet restaurant.  The vouchers were not valid at the other restaurants so do not book this for a dine around experience. Also the main bar which overlooks the beach was closed the whole time apart from 4 weddings that took place. This is wrong that hotel guests were unable to use this area. The lady playing music and singing most nights was very good.The entertainment group was on our last night in the hotel only (out of a 10 night stay) which was 3 ladies doing different dances. They were not introduced beforehand or thanked afterwards by hotel staff.  It went on whilst hotel guests were eating dinner.  They came and went without much applause or thanks.  This I thought was wrong of the hotel too.  The ladies must have wished they hadn’t bothered!  Food and variety was very good in the main buffet restaurant but it would have been nice if we could have tried the other restaurants too as part of our half board.I must mention Philipa in the restaurant and David the waiter who were both excellent."
Aug 2018,30,Could do better. ,"Had a lovely 2 weeks holiday with my husband, myself and our daughter and husband with 2 grandsons aged 12 and 15, although I couldn’t describe it as 5 Star. More3/4. Cleaning of public parts of hotel very good, rooms not so good. Long black hair left in bath several times (we are both short grey haired). Floors not washed or brushed every day, and when they were washed sometimes the water was dirtier than the floor. Also back board of side table at bed had been splashed with something before our arrival and was still there when we left 14 days later. No toilet rolls, new towels left along with old towels. Little things that showed lack of organisation in cleaning department. We have stayed in many 5star hotels and most have a housekeeper that checks the rooms after cleaning. Another moan was food. Lots of choice but not great quality, particularly when it came to meat. Most of it had been grossly over cooked rendering it really tough and tasteless. The morning bacon was so dry and brittle that you couldn’t put a fork in it because it just broke into pieces. Staff were a very mixed bunch, some very engaging and some downright surly. Waiters in the upstairs bar very nice, good memories. Staff in the restaurant should clear plates as you leave the table to get the next course, instead they are hovering and the plate is lifted from in front of you as you put the last mouthful in and are still chewing. Most disconcerting. However the two really bright spots are the location, (which is beautiful) and the restaurant not included in the half board tariff, the Santa Eulália restaurant. This was absolutely amazing as was the food and the staff. Would give this 6 stars. In all the potential is there, it needs the management to lead from the front as it does in most successful establishments"
Aug 2018,40,beautiful location,"beautiful location beside the beach , lovely apartments with their own pools; also the pools at the hotel along with bars and restaurants were great ;free buses to/from Albufeira were very convenient.just make sure not to get apartment too far from facilities / too close to road - minor issue only."
Aug 2018,50,Pleasant stay,A very nice 4 nights stay with my 3 year old.Some of the outside public areas are a bit shabby and need some tlc but all good otherwise!Santa Eulalia restaurant is excellent but wish it was open every night.Will be back again!
Aug 2018,50,Great 8 night stay,"Just returned from an 8 night stay with my partner and 6 year old child.Really laid back atmosphere, lovely hotel and facilities, 2minute walk down to beach, shuttle bus to Albufeira new and old town, public bus stop just outside both ways to get to surrounding areas, Vilamoura ect. Very chilled laid back approach throughout, would recommend"
Aug 2018,40,Good experience,"Had a 10 night stay, on a bed/breakfast basis in an apartment. The apartment was cleaned daily to a high standard, but were some signs of ageing fabrics & a slight musty smell in  the wardrobes. The breakfast was excellent with good variety, some of the other eating places were expensive. The pool areas had plenty of loungers. The staff were mainly very helpful & polite. Over all a lovely place to stay & would not hesitate to return."
Aug 2018,50,One week in sunny Portugal!,"I stayed with my teenage sons at this beautiful resort. I opted for a self-catering flat this time. We had a marvelous time and this resort is highly recommendable. All staff are most helpful, the rooms are lovely and clean and there is nothing negative really to comment on. Would happily go here again. The beach is very close and ideal for teenagers as watersports are on the offer. My boys go diving, and it was easy to get to the local Indigo diving school by taxi. Brilliant diving school too! Plenty of activities around so a good place for teenagers."
Aug 2018,50,Short break,Lovely 5x hotel all.well equipped for self catering loved deck chairs in the garden and lovely food cleaned every day will defo visit again thanks for making are.break a happy1 plenty of lifts to get to it floodplain.was.lovely and kept well.clean even for this time of year the shops where fine and close by restaurants food was lovelywwhad about 15 minuet walk to the main stretch and the beach but it was a nice stroll and I would not recommend staying.to.close to the bars and clubs as very noisy thanks Linda
Aug 2018,30,Luxury price but no al la carte restuarants open,"We stayed here from 11th June 2018 for two weeks on a half board basis. The hotel was sold to us as a luxury 5 star plus beach and spa resort.  We are a couple in our early 50's and were hoping to have a chilled holiday utilising the spa and treatments and having a lovely al la carte meal in the evenings with some entertainment at the hotel bar area.Unfortunately there were a number of services closed while we were staying here. This only came to light on our return home and I had a look at the reviews on here.  We were never informed by the travel agent, Jet2 or the hotel staff on check-in that the al la carte restaurants were closed.  If we had been notified we would not have booked half board as two weeks of buffet style food is not what we would have chosen.We found that the two main pools were full of young children with inflatables which is fine but awkward for anyone wanting to swim as they are round swimming pools.  There were no adults only pools or quiet areas for sunbathing and reading.  We noticed that if you didn't get down early then you didn't have a sunbed and as a result there were a number of people, some with  young children, having to put towels on the grass area - this is not what you'd expect with 5 star luxury. Again, we found on returning home that it was probably due to some pool areas in the self catering sections having no poolside bars open.  The Jet2 website states ""please note: pools, restaurants and bars are open subject to occupancy and seasonal demand."" This was not pointed out to us on booking and as a customer how would we know if the hotel is not at full occupancy?  I also wouldn't class June as out of season either.The hotel was very clean although slightly dated and the staff were lovely which has made me rate the hotel slightly higher.  My husband and I used the gym/fitness room every day and attended a couple of classes; StretchFit and Pilates.  The man who took the class was amazing and if you're into your fitness, definitely give this a go.  I had a rejuvenating/anti-aging facial which was lovely and relaxing. This cost €110 and lasted 80 minutes, expensive but I had planned to treat myself before the holiday.  I would have had more but was disappointed by not being able to relax after the treatment around the pool area.The hotel offers a free shuttle service into the old town which we did 3 times. This was our preferred place to stay actually but the travel agent didn't make this clear (not the hotel's problem though).  The shuttle bus while we stayed there ran at 10:25, 11:25, 13:25, 16:25 and 18:25.  The return from the old town was 10:10, 11:10, 13:10, 16:10 and 18:10.  Personally we would have preferred a later return and eaten in the old town but you could use taxis.  There was only a couple of places to eat close to the hotel which we didn't fancy, pizza place and an Italian, I think?We walked a few times into the new town which took approximately 20 minutes which was ok for an ice cream stop or a quick lunch and is lively at night (I stayed here in my 30's but it's not for me now!)The Atlantico Restaurant Bar near the beach is lovely.  Some nice, light choices for lunch and a great selection of ice creams.  The service is pretty quick too and it was busy.  I think overall the food and drink prices were quite reasonable in the hotel, cappuccinos and lattes were €2/€3, smoothies €4, tortilla wraps €5, water 1.5l €3.  We spent 2 days on the beach and this was absolutely lovely.  It cost €5 for 2 sunbeds and a brolly for the day and was definitely worth it. It was very peaceful and I wished we had done this more.I think the hotel closing al la carte restaurants, pool area bars and limited entertainment in the evening was short-sighted as we ended up not spending as much as we didn't bother with further spa treatments or stay in the bar area in the evening (we came home with €800 which will go nicely to next years holiday)."
Aug 2018,30,Excellent hotel needs refurbishment,We stayed at this hotel nine years ago and we do not think much had been done in terms of redecoration or refurbishment in that time. Everything worked and the food was average to good but the bedroom furniture and bathrooms were very tired.
Aug 2018,40,Enjoyable but not 5*,This was actually my 10th stay at this hotel and after not visiting for 3 years we noticed the difference in standards. Whilst the hotel is still good and we enjoyed our stay it does not warrant its 5* rating. I noticed they have made many changes in the restaurant including tea/coffee machines for self service including plastic spoons..... exactly the same food choices each day and chaotic queuing and self service. The last time we stayed here in 2015 the food was of a much better quality with more variety and the tea and coffee were ordered and brought to the table. Guests wandering round with hot drinks in a busy dining room is an accident waiting to happen!The resort apartments have not changed still clean and functional and ideal for families. I don’t like the rationing of pool towels though and if you are staying in an apartment it’s a drag having to change them each day in reception. The pool areas look tired and a lot of decking needs replacing. The pool bar was closed although we were told the hotel was 90% occupied. Obviously all cost cutting measures but not acceptable for a 5* hotel in my opinion.Would I stay again? Maybe but at nearly €300 per night I would perhaps look at somewhere a bit more up to date. It’s a shame as in its day you could not beat ths lovely hotel.
Aug 2018,20,My Stay,"not a value for money hotel, rooms needs renovation. hot breakfast was not good, made earlier. vegetarian options are limited. front desk people were not kind. even for the payment they did not have equipment which they could use to pre-authorise, I was told they need to write the credit card details on the paper which was not safe. anyways...not a value for money. for kids they have good activities."
Aug 2018,50,Great hotel,"The hotel was immaculately clean and the staff were very friendly.The breakfast was very good although busy. There were some queues if you arrived after 09:30.Lots of activities for the children.A fantastic beach with a great jet ski, paddle board, para sail activities.A cab ride into Albufeira was 6 euros and the hotel provides a free bus.The burger restaurant was excellent and I recommend the cod burger!"
Aug 2018,10,"Interesting localization but old rooms with bad service; very good fish restaurant, the buffet absolutely to avoid","Except the localization and fish restaurant, this hotel was one of my bad hotels experience, old rooms equipment, luck of staff training, buffet with long queue and limited offer which is the same everyday"
Aug 2018,50,Very nice hotel,beautiful grounds. great location and had a great time.I travelled back in Dec 2017. We had just come back from Asia were we probably were constantly travelling and just wanted a few days to chill. We got a bargin as it was off season. but personally it was just to relax. its true the pubs and bars were mainly closed. but this did not bother us as its not something that interested us. we actually preferred it. we got some good weather.the hotel staff were nice and pleasant and helped us when needed.
Aug 2018,50,Family holiday,Just coming to the end of a relaxing family holiday. Stayed in an apartment and did bed and breakfast which suited us fine. May try hotel next time. Staff very helpful at all times. Children enjoyed the kids club - took advantage of swimming lessons our 5year old had a great time and did well- cost 5euros ( money well spent) thanks Antonio. Beautiful resort in a lovey setting.
Aug 2018,50,Perfect short break,I booked this for a short break for myself and partner. The hotel was fabulous. The staff were wonderful and the quality of food and drink was great. The room we stayed in was beautiful and had the most gorgeous view of the ocean. They provide a shuttle bus that takes you into the new and old town regularly throughout the day. Perfect stay in a lovely hotel. I’ll be returning without a doubt
Aug 2018,40,Family stay over August,"Was a nice place, we went there to relax really and mainly spent time in pools and around. The beach is 5 min walk down, nice sandy beach. The water is somewhat cold though, so with kids hotel pools are a better option. Food was nice, although our 2 year old had a hard time finding anything for her liking. Main restaurant is pricy if you dont reserve your stay with meals includes. The main downside is there are no reataurnts in the hotel vicinity that serve lunch, they all start mainly after 3pm. We have reserved half board with intention of exploring areas during the day - didn’t know places would be closed. Overall had a good time with the family."
Aug 2018,50,Two week stay at Grande Real Santa Eulalia resort and hotel spa,"A fabulous luxurious and relaxing stay at a fantastic hotel. We felt very well  looked after by the friendly and helpful staff; nothing was a trouble. The accommodation was first rate; the food first class, varied and catered for everyone. We would highly recommend staying here. We will be back!"
Aug 2018,30,Cockroach in room,Found cockroaches in room and staff seemed to not care...Came a few years ago and was perfect but now they have dropped standards Also they dont give rooms until 3pm so we got there in the morning through jet2 and had to wait hrs til we got a room
Aug 2018,40,Almost 5 stars,Hotel is beautiful as is the location. Although I do think it's more 4 than 5 stars. Services are excellent. We attended a wedding and it was just fabulous. Hotel is so nice the little touches of nightly turn down service are what keep this hotel at its 5 Star rating along with spa and location. We were just a little disappointed by the ant situation :( I understand it's not always easy to keep places like this ant free but our room was quite bad. That was my only fault.Rooms are comfortable and beds are super comfy I would still recommend this hotel. Food and drinks were great too. Beach front restaurant is lovely although waiter a little in friendly:/ Otherwise it's a fab spot.
Aug 2018,20,"So disappointed, Not a 5 star, Horrible air conditioning","This is my first bad review. We are frequent travelers and have stayed at many, many resorts. My family and I stayed recently at the Grande Real Santa in rooms 27 and 28.  Although there were many things we liked and enjoyed at the resort, we had a large problem with the air conditioning in the rooms.  The weather in Albufeira was hot, but not oppressive during those days at 33-34 degrees.   However, we immediately knew the air conditioning was not cooling the rooms well at all.   We contacted the front staff 4 times during the vacation, and each time a maintenance team came to the room and stated everything was working normally and the air temperature would not get any lower. One person said ""it's because it's hot outside"" which is a strange response because I would only need to use the air conditioning if it was hot.  No one from the front desk or management contacted us to see if we were satisfied or if we would want to switch rooms.  We kept the curtains closed constantly and the temperature of the thermostat at 15-16 degrees, but the air coming into the room was barely cool.  I doubt the room temperature was less than 27 degrees at night, and sleeping for us and our two children was very uncomfortable. A 5 star hotel on a beach which is frequently busy during the hottest months of the year, it was very disappointing to have experienced the conditions in the room, and the lack of responsibility and caring by the maintenance team and the management. I would never stay here again!"
Aug 2018,50,Weekend Break with Friends,"We had a lovely, relaxing stay at this resort for 3 nights. Our friends stayed in the hotel with a sea view room which was lovely, all very clean. Tea/coffee facilities in rooms would of been a nice touch considering the price of the rooms. Myself and my two teenage daughters were allocated an apartment, these were not as nice as the rooms in the main hotel, beds hard and noise of young children in next door apartments could be heard.! Very clean and tidy though, good service. I would recommend this resort if your staying in hotel. Beautiful beach, facilities and fantastic food."
Aug 2018,50,Beautiful Resort,We have stayed at this hotel for the past 2 years and hope to stay again next year. The staff are very friendly and very accommodating. The staff at the beach resturant are not so friendly unfortunately in particular the head waiter..... The staff at the garden pool bar could teach him how to behave. The very spacious apartments are spotless and looked after by a cleaning team who are friendly and efficient.
Aug 2018,50,Excellent resort at very good location,"An excellent resort with lots of restaurants. The sea view cafe was excellent with great choices and decent price. With the beach next door, it was awesome. Quite a lot of pools for freshening up in fresh water after the sea beach trip. Kids club with decent set of activities and very polite staff. The shuttle service to Albufiera town is a bonus. Overall a nice stay."
Aug 2018,20,5 Stars where did that come from ?,"I do not agree this hotel is worthy of its 5 star status or indeed the tripadvisor rating it has.  We have stayed at better 3 star and much better 4 star hotels in the past. Our studio apartment although large and functional was certainly not luxury. The meals during our one week HB stay were poor with little choice and very bland  This was reflected by the low number of guests who dined each evening. Parts of the hotel grounds were untidy, with peeling paint and loose and broken paving. The large skip full of old bedding and bin bags that lay near the front entrance to the hotel for the duration of our stay sums up the true quality of this hotel.  During my stay I filled in a formal complaint form with the Jet2 rep. who passed it on to the hotel management.  My delay in submitting this review was caused by a prolonged correspondence with Jet2 Holidays."
Aug 2018,40,very relaxing hotel,"Very helpful staff, they cannot do enough for you.Rooms are traditional, very clean and all are close to one of the pools. We didn't have a see view but it was a nice quite resort for us and the kids loved it.*****"
Aug 2018,50,Return visit,"We love this hotel!! We stayed last year and decided to return. The location is great and the kids love the kids club. The food is good and the staff friendly and helpful.The only thing missing is evening entertainment. There is a disco in a lovely area of the hotel one night a week but it’s only on till 9pm so by the time you have have dinner you have missed it. There are sometimes singers on in the background but a show or something would be better. Also a kids disco would be great!We will probably return next year, we met several families who also returned year after year!"
Aug 2018,50,Lovely hotel ,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 days in a self catering apartment. The apartment had everything we needed for the duration of our stay, was very clean and well kept. We were greeted by Jerome on arrival and can say that we couldn’t have asked for a warmer welcome. He was so informative and made us feel relaxed. The hotel itself is lovely and has the most beautiful scenery. We stayed around our apartment pool most of the time but the main hotel pool areas were great with plenty of sun loungers to choose from. Not a lot of night time entertainment but a free bus will take you to either the old or new towns in Albufeira where there are plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. Overall a great stay in a beautiful location."
Aug 2018,10,Spa ,"My review is based on the Spa.We got married in the hotel 4 years ago and returned to celebrate with our 3 year old son  for 4 days. My parents arrived and staying elsewhere for the rest of our holiday my mother and I returned to the Spa for a treat, it was anything but! We booked in pedicures as I'm 3 months pregnant and wasn't sure regarding safety of oils used etc. My mother's pedi was booked for 2pm an hour before mine so I asked could I use the relaxation room the lady said ""It's very dark in there and will be too long, head upstairs"" so with 15 minutes until her treatment we sat by the pool which was very hot and uncomfortable no towels offered for beds even. At 2pm my mam headed for her treatment and I was shown to the relaxation room which was basic to say the least. When i was called for mine the lady wasn't very friendly and I presumed her English wasn't great and that was why  she wasn't acknowledging anything I said. When we got to the room my mother was sitting letting her nails dry and I got onto the bed (no pedicure chairs, a basin is used to wet feet really uncomfortable) when the lady doing my nails discovered I was wearing shellac she was very annoyed. Kept saying I should have told them that as to remove the shellac it was nessesery to book a different treatment (60 mins was not long enough apparently) I said I would be happy to leave and rebook for another day and that i didn't realise removing shellac was such an issue and she proceeded to use a file to remove it which to be honest I thought was disgraceful as it would only weaken my nails.. the whole time she was visibly annoyed and stressed so much so I had to ask her to stop being so rough as the pedicure was so painful. I apologised several times for the mix up and she wasn't happy to let me leave but also decided to be mean and unnecessarily rough as she was ""short for time"". I offered to pay more she told me it would be an extra €5. I have NEVER been treated so badly or made to feel so uncomfortable in any spa never mind the several 5star ones I have had treatments in before. And then the worst part.. huge cockroaches started to jump out of towels in room and scurry around me... I saw 4 god knows how many I didn't see. At that point I thought I was going to cry. She left the room. Returned told me they fumigated the day before and she was sorry about it. I'm not even sure it's safe to be in a room that's been fumigated a day later. She finished the treatment I only had €10 I didn't care to wait for my change and i left. I'm disgusted that I spent €65 to be treated so badly regardless of the fact that the Spa was infested with cockroaches. No I understand why she was reluctant to let us use the facilities. Absolutely shocking!!!! Do not book in here and waste your money."
Aug 2018,50,What a difference a * makes,"First of all I need to clarify that I haven't actually stayed here, I have simply used the hotel facilities. I am currently a guest at the sister hotel 4* Real Bella Vista. Being extremely unhappy at my hotel (see my review for details) I opted to take the hotel bus to try this one out instead. Wow, what a difference that extra star makes, the pool area here is beautiful, clean & spacious overlooking the sea. There is a lovely relaxing atmosphere about the place. The hotel cafe served us a lovely brunch at a reasonable price. The pool bar is well stocked & although a bit pricey at €10.50 for 3 cans of coke I would happily pay it over & over. The view from the pool area across to the sea is sensational & access to the beach is excellent. I only wish I could rewind time & book my family into this hotel instead. I was sad to get the bus back to my hotel!!"
Aug 2018,40,Algarve 2018,"Location nice and not in the middle of the party zone of albufeira . Room was clean just a little old from the interior. Breakfast is okay and the Buffet is quite big but more for english people... We tried one night the Restaurant at the beach which is not open every night, Service was busy mostly but the Restaurant was not even full... We Had a bottle of wine but the waiter didnt know from which region in Portugal it was and we Had to service the bottle by ourself.... I Had the fishsoup with seafruits and Filets of fish but couldnt find any seafruits i told it to the waiter but he didnt Care ,for main i tried the vealsteak which was to dry and Well done for me because nobody asked me how i like it .... We where never asked if everything is okay maybe they dont care much about tourists... What a shame im really sorry for this review, people should know you will not get treated Well for those prices you Take, there far more better and cheaper Restaurants nearby where this never happend to us."
Aug 2018,20,Very disappointing ,"This is never ever a 5* hotel! People rating this hotel with 5* have very very low expectations and probably never stayed in a 5* before. I am writing this review at 1 am, neighboors are fighting since one hour. To us it seems like there are absolutely no walls. You can hear everything, from toilet flushs to tv sound! Terrible!Bathrooms probably never have been renovated since 30 years. Not even the toilet brush is intact.Pool infrastructure is a joke for an hotel of this size. If you are looking for a place where you can chill next to the pool, don’t come here.Food is very standart - the breakfast buffet is so crowded with people that you have to stay in line to get a table. Lines at the buffet are even longer. Everything costs - the hotel is already really expensive considering what you get. Extra costs for everything, from table tennis to fresh water... very disapointing.Everything is very old - there isn’t probably one single m2 of carpet in front of our room which does not have hundreds of spots of food rests. Staff is friendly and eveything is clean.We are staying in this hotel because we were invited at a wedding and wanted to add one week of holidays. The wedding was magically! Everything was beautiful an perfect. But to spend your holidays I strongly recommend you to stay somewhere else. This is a waste of time."
Aug 2018,50,Perfect Hotel - Could not ask for better,"Absolutely stunning hotel and resort, made to feel extremely welcome, the staff in all areas of the hotel and restaurants very polite and courteous.  The swimming pool areas are lovely, the beach is exceptional, the rooms clean and spacious - no complaints whatsoever."
Aug 2018,50,Anniversary,"After reading  various reviews I was not disappointed On arrival we were most impressed by the grand entrance to the hotel, the friendly smiling faces that greeted us after a tirering flight. Prior to arrival of the holiday I emailed the hotel to arrange a little surprise to be in our room on arrival as it was our anniversary,  ( a bottle of bubbly) as a surprise for my husband. The manager insisted that this would be compliments of the hotel which was amazing. On our arrival we were given the details of our room ( I couldn't wait to see my husband's face as we entered.. with bubbles on ice)Sadly this didn't happen..I did have to phone reception to remind  the staff to bring it  to our room. ( this does not in any way detract from this amazing hotel.) my husband did wonder why I was I  the phone when he came out of the bathroomHowever.. when it did arrive..I was pleasantly surprised... Not only was there bubbly but fruit, chocolate for dipping... little cakes.. it was wonderful... whilst overlooking the sea..very romantic (husband was blown away) Thank you !!We only booked B&B but really wished we did half board.. food has been a little expensive, the food here is fantastic I cannot fault it.. but if I am being really picky...I missed not having Bananas with my pancakes. We have eaten in the hotels various restaurants and have NOT been disappointed by the cleanliness, quality and service.. again well doneWe only have a few days left of our time here and wish it was longer.. normally I cannot wait to get home.. but we have been so relaxed, calm and contented.We're already planning our next time here and will bring the grandchildren our daughter will love it. I will be sorry to leave, but thankful that I found you ""Grande Real Santa Eulalia""Until next time....xKathleen"
Aug 2018,50,Family Holiday,"What an absolutely brilliant holiday we have had at this wonderful resort. The room was spacious and comfortable, the food was amazing with so much choice, the pools were fantastic and the close proximity  to the beach made for an excellent all round trip. The staff here are also fantastic- friendly, attentive and always smiling. Thank you all. We will be back!"
Aug 2018,20,I survived the Algarve - May try Alcatraz next,"This is a marmite hotel.The rooms are quite good, we had self catering with a large bedroom, and a large sitting room, with powerful air conditioning. There are shortfalls though, as the only provision was a single bottle of water, with no useful kitchen essentials (kitchen roll, washing up, salt and pepper etc.). The pots (as always) were huge, but no way of frying an egg!The staff are exceptionally helpful, but share the need for exaggerated ""Team America"" Arm waving to realise with most of the local staff to this area.Where things start to go wrong is when you try the food within the various eating areas. Our first experience was an almost 100% wrong order from the Pool bar, with one of the least appetising Ham and cheese rolls since British Rail stopped selling their week old options in the seventies. This was compounded by the other ""snack"" bar, which serves food equivalent to a Blackpool Truckers Cafe.Unfortunately this partially extends to the main bar as well, who have a very limited, and very rigid ""menu"" for drinks, and are not flexible when asked to go ""off piste"" and provide a drink without their enforced mixer, or with no ice.We can't really comment about the other restaurants (there appeared to be two open during our visit), as they seemed to be largely under-used, and hence appeared to be concentrating more on the fully inclusive customer.The real issue though is that there is very little to do in the baking heat, without getting a taxi - the free bus being of limited value as it only stops in two locations neither of which were directly of interest to us. The Taxis were able to get much closer to the action, and hence represent better value for money if you don't want to walk around for a good 1/4 hour to get to civilisation.As to eating places around the Hotel, there are effectively four:-The Italian (Portobello) by the top of the road - Cheap and cheerful with reasonable Pizza and House Wine, but poor pastaThe Fish Restaurant (Pecurina) at the seas edge - Nice food, but seemed to make a lot of bill mistakes (both our bills had major overcharging)The Grill house (RM Martins) to the left of Main Gates - Best food, good wine, and mid value - well worth a visit.The Dutch One (Holland EetHouse) to the right and up a most un-inspiring street beside the travel office - Good homely food of Germanic Operation - but excellent service, and a real instant relaxed atmsophere - and the kids can splash in the pool as the adults enjoy the company.Shopping is also a little sparse in the area, but it seems best to turn right from the gate.Almost opposite the top corner of the site, the shop is full of cheap product, hone baked items, and local produce.A little further up the hill, there is a larger shop which has a bigger selection of familiar foods, but a little more expensive.At the top of the hill is a well equipped Pharmacy, beside the most comprehensive shop - but by far the dearest.So I am afraid Self Catering really requires a car, or a lot of use of Taxis, but getting breakfast and snacks is relatively easy.One final point is that all the taxis booked by reception were driven by helpful and chatty drivers, that could be relied upon to give better local advise on where to go than the holiday reps! On that subject, be aware that the Algarve Experience tours all seem to share a dismal record - the one we went on involved 6 hours sitting on a bus, with approx 10 minutes of ""guiding"", with only a 1/2 hour wine tasting, and 2 hour lunch break (in Lagos) relieving the boredom.Sorry, but I know that we are not unique in our wishes, and also knowing that for an all inclusive family break with 2-15 year olds, this could be an almost perfect hotel (it has a variety of pools, games rooms, light evening entertainment and other facilities - nearly all of which appear under used).I suppose visiting during the hotest period for a century may have also coloured our views a little :-)"
Aug 2018,40,Great hotel and apartments ,"Stayed here July/Aug 19 in 1 bedroom apartment bed and breakfast. Apartments dated but very clean the whole complex very clean. Staff all very pleasant especially cleaners and waiters in the fish restaurant we loved it there. Breakfast was of high standard. Albufeira Old Town was a little disappointing as still a lot of English/ German bars offering full English cocktails with football on , walk up from the main drag to find more local tapas etc. Only down side we found was the apartments were very noisy this was due to other guests not the actual resort, think we were quite unlucky with our neighbours so we were tired a lot of the time. The pools and the sea were very cold surprisingly at this time of year.Would stay at this hotel again though as more positives than negatives. My 8 year old son loved the mini football pitch and kids club ( PlayStation). Obrigado Grande Real Santa Eulalia 😘"
Aug 2018,40,Fabulous hotel,"Lovely hotel and amazing staff, the location is superb, the view from a sea view room amazing. The breakfasts are perfect everything you could wish for and so fresh. The rooms are lovely but a little shabby and dated. The poolside area is wonderful although we were slightly out of season, very relaxing and we have booked again!! Great restaurants in walking distance too."
Aug 2018,50,Ignore the bad reviews!,"Back from an eight night stay. Ryan air — all fine. Greenbus transfer — avoid at all costs.The hotel is excellent. Breakfast is well worth the money, the family apartments are excellent if oddly coloured. We overlooked the pool, which we could always get a space at — infant at times (peak times) we had it to ourselves.Dinner can be great. It's expensive. Brazilian night was 5*, Italian probably 3*. Each night is themed by country, so just check first.Staff will do anything to help, really excellent and attentive. It's a large complex but for the max walk is 3-4 min. For this who can't be bothered, reception will collect you in a golf buggy. The cleaners are great and spend a long time preparing each apartment every day, if you want them to.Don't bother with the open top bus tour, terrible. Old town lacks the culture of other old towns. Albufeira at large is a bit of a mess, especially as you approach The Strip. The best pastry shop I have ever visited is in Albufeira, near Mcdonalds / KFC / Buger King and the watch roundabout — ask when there...Eat it all.We're considering booking again next year, and that's from a non-beach-holiday family with two young sons (7 & 9) who were in their element and were sad to leave having made lots of friends. Albufeira beach is great, as is the old town beach and many others...Lots to choose from, but the hotel and the pool is hard to leave because it's all so relaxing. Portabello's opposite is great for a reasonably priced fresh pizza / pasta / family run place."
Aug 2018,50,Wonderful winter holidays!,"Great resort in Santa Eulalia, near the beach, with all the services you need to spend a fabulous time, whether during the winter or the summer. It is impossible not to leave a note of appreciation to the employees, always so kind and professional."
Jul 2018,50,Our Dream Wedding! Special thanks to Angela!,"I am writing to thank sincerely Angela and all the staff at GRSE for the huge effort they made in making our wedding such a wonderful experience for ourselves and our guests. Anglea in GRSE together with our amazing wedding planners Dave and Steffi exceeded all our expectations and went above and beyond the call of duty. The atmosphere within the hotel, the manners and work rate of the staff and the quality of the food in GRSE ensured our wedding day passed without a hitch. Angela worked so hard to accommodate food preferences and needless to say the setting blew our guests away. Thank you so much to all the staff at GRSE and congratulations to any couple planning their wedding there!!UnaMarried 8/7/18"
Jul 2018,20,Not 5 star!,"I stayed here for a wedding im July. The room we were put in was very far but hard to walk on due to the ground which needs improvement. Our stay here was spoiled on the first night when our card for room would not work leaving us locked out in the cold for an hour. We called multiple times and after 20 minutes a card was dropped up but the guy drove off before it was checked. It did not work. I then had to trek to reception to get fixed. Guy on reception didnt really care, had no explanation and couldnt say when it would be fixed. After an hour it was fixed. I told the manager the next day but there was only a token apology given and they will look in to it. Nothing was done to make my stay any better. Its really not 5 five star in terms of food, drink, decor, service. Disappointing considering the price"
Jul 2018,20,Visited the terrace restaurant,Had booked via email for a treat meal for 3 girlfriends. They didn’t have our booking when we got there but tables were available. Instead of just seating us we were made to wait for about 10 minutes whilst the waiters ignored us until we asked again. We were then seated.Had an OK but far from outstanding meal. Starters were good but main courses must have been left out for a while before serving as they were cold. Compared to other places we ate on our trip it was over priced for what we got.Service was slow. We did mention the cold meals but were exhausted from the slow service and arrival so didn’t pursue this point.
Jul 2018,50,Worth every cent.,"An hotel  visit in different times os the year, particularly early winter and summer. A wonderful place to rest en enjoy Nature. Was there first 3 weeks of July and even a maximum occupation it was not crowded. Two smiling pools, several beaches near by. Great rooms. Excellent service as usual."
Jul 2018,50,"Exceptional hotel, highly recommend","Spent 5 days last week at Santa Eulalia and had the most incredible stay. The staff were very attentive, hotel was incredibly clean and well maintained. Having a beach literally minutes away was just an added bonus. Would absolutely recommend without question."
Jul 2018,50,"Great service, lovely hotel","I went here with my son for a few days and it was great. Service is amazing, they cab arrange anything you’d wish. As soon as you arrive, staff help you with your bagage etc which is perfect when travelling alone with a child. Pools were great fun, but we also ventured out to a beach a bit further away from Albufeira and also spent a day at Zoomarine which was brilliant. We had such a lovely time here!"
Jul 2018,50,Recommend this hotel,We stayed at this hotel for one week in June as a family. It is situated by the beach with excellent facilities. The rooms were spacious with great views. Breakfasts were from a large selection. I would definitely return to stay here.
Jul 2018,40,Family Wedding/Holiday,From the moment of arrival we were greeted by lovely reception staff & if we needed anything on our stay staff were only to happy to oblige. Sandra the Wedding Planner was amazing & a big thank you for making my sisters day so special. The hotel is very clean and has beautiful views. The beach is about a 5 min walk from the hotel. Rooms are a little dated but spacious and kept clean by the lovely housekeeping staff. There is a free shuttle bus that runs to the old town & new town which is handy. The kids loved the pool but at night they were lacking entertainment for them which was a little bit disappointing. There wasn't much entertainment at night and not sure if this was due to us visiting out of high season. I would definitely stay here again!
Jul 2018,50,Comfortable Family Resort,"This is a Resort connected to the beach with many facilities specially for family with Kids.You have the option of  Apartment or Hotel room. Our One bedroom Apartment was very suitable for family with 2 Kids located directly on the Pool.Furniture old but not Bad, Housekeeping take care from everything on daily basis.They have kids Club open daily with a lot of supervision that you can keep your kids with been afraid and this gave us a relax vacation and from other side Kids Enjoy the friendship of the staff.You feel that the stuff all need you to be relax and happy during your stay , this is a good management.negative points that the restaurant limited the lunch and dinner to open buffet that didn't gave a flexibility for us and we were obliged daily to take our meals outside.They keep the snack option that we cannot repeat it  on daily basis.For bus to Old Town its a very good facility but having last turn at 6:15 PM ( where peoples just need to move to the Town) don't open the possibility to use it when going back to resort,having Bus till 10:00 PM will be a good change."
Jul 2018,50,Great Place to Stay with Kids,"We spent 8 nights here in early June and were traveling with our 6 month old son. This hotel is a fantastic place to spend with young kids. We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom apartment which we really appreciated. While the apartment itself was a little dated, it was clean and very spacious. The lobby and common areas of the hotel itself are beautiful and we really enjoyed sitting on the terrace and having a drink from the bar!  The hotel is right on the beach which is so convenient. The beach itself was quite nice and not overcrowded (I suppose that would depend on the time of year!!). We also spent time in the pool area. There were multiple pools which made it good for us as we could take our little guy into the smaller pools away from the older kids and adults. There was a kids club as well. Our son was too young to go but the other kids seemed to enjoy it. We did not eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the food. There are restaurants walking distance away but if you want more authentic fare like we did we just jumped in a taxi. 8 euros will get you into the old town. Lastly, a very special thank you to Ines, the service manager. On our first day, our son cut his foot. She personally made sure he was taken care of which put our minds at ease knowing that the hotel was there if needed.   We give our experience a 5 star rating because it was the perfect place for us to stay with our little guy.   We enjoyed our stay and will definitely return on our next trip."
Jul 2018,50,"Lovely resort, friendly people","Stayed here for 6 nights.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  Resort clean, rooms very comfortable. Would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. Buffet breakfast was included, and very good.  Only ate in the restaurant at night once, only negative for me.  Possibly just the choice that night.  Bar staff outstanding.  Restaurant staff very efficient.  Pools a little small for the size of the resort, but the beach is just a short walk away.  Walkway to the beach is very pretty.  Definitely would recommend."
Jul 2018,20,Not what the brochure says....,"Booked this resort with my parents (75/76) and son aged 15. The setting, rooms and swimming pools looked great in the brochure... It's NOT 5 star..Firstly it says 7 swimming pools - well, if you are a hamster and don't mind swimming in circles dodging small people it's for you... but then we found a proper pool - below ground in the spa area.. HOWEVER they charge  €20 for one hours swim!!! Never heard of such a thing ... needless to say we went back to being hamsters. Room was pleasant although the maids could smack a smile on it...Don't go for the non sea view... you face a car park and breath in carbon monoxide while sunning on your balcony! We went full board, the buffet was very nice with a good choice but chaotic and very noisy in the restaurant (small people again and bad acoustics for hard of hearing father) so we insisted on seating outside. The waiting staff are brilliant - couldn't ask for more. BUT if you want to use any of the other restaurants on the resort, even if you are full board you have to pay full price!The beds on the beach are €10 for a couple of hours.. I swear the guys selling the beds must be multi millionaires! The evenings entertainment were two guys singing who, on the 1st night were most enjoyable however, they only had one set piece so by the 3rd night we knew what song was coming up - we then dodged them!As said earlier this is not a 5 star hotel.. it might look grand but the extras you have to pay far outweigh the slightly dated decor. If you don't have little ones anymore it can be quite overwhelming, although I did spot a kids club leader in the swimming pool trying to entertain the cherubs with a poorly blown up, 3ft broken net to play volleyball!  It goes without saying we will not be returning but we did enjoy our family trip away - English humour saved us!"
Jul 2018,20,Not so grand....,"Evening buffet very poor.  Poor choice and lukewarm or cold food.  Seems to be the case that Management disregard this matter as reviews on Trip Adviser regularly highlight this problem.  I myself experienced stomach problems on holiday here, something I attribute to the food.  Apartment rooms are damp and smell fusty.  Evening entertainment is virtually non existent.  Hotel much too expensive for the end product.  Beach convenient though."
Jul 2018,50,Perfect Perfect Perfect,"My boyfriend and I had booked this place for our anniversary and it was without a doubt the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The reception team were all so helpful and arranged for champagne and fruit with chocolate to be sent to our room on the first night. The man who checked us in wore a trainee badge but was an absolute pro!Our room was very spacious and we were lucky enough to have a room with an outdoor terrace facing the sea. The pool was amazing, we never struggled to get a sun bed. The hotel offers complementary beach towels which you can give in at the end of the day in exchange for fresh ones. There's a path that leads directly to the beach and the setting was truly beautiful.The breakfast buffet was delicious and there were so many options. All of the restaurants and bars had such a high quality of food and the cocktail selection was amazing. This location is brilliant for couples wanting a romantic quiet holiday away. The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to the old town which is ideal for exploring Albufeira. A massive thank you to all the staff at Grande Real Santa Eulalia for making our stay so memorable and enjoyable. We will definitely return!"
Jul 2018,50,Enjoyable surroundings,"Close to beach, several pools available, free bus ride into and from newtown/old town, some excursions can be arranged by them (gypsy market Loule). Restaurants food good, can be busy so allow extra time. Very clean, all staff very helpful and polite. If you make an effort to learn some of the basic language whilst you are there they'll help with that too."
Jul 2018,50,Lovely family Christmas & New Year,What a fabulous resort.... lovely 1 bedroom apartment (be sure to ask for a sunny apartment as many get little sun in winter).Top notch buffet breakfast with many gluten & dairy free choices.We only ate dinner at the hotel once & it was excellent.  Christmas lunch was also very good.Our then 6 year old son loved the kids club.Lovely Beach right below hotel with a lovely cafe nearby.Walks over cliffs were really spectacular from the beach.Even a nightclub within the grounds which was excellent - far away from rooms. Staff were all amazing.Plenty of restaurants nearby.One of outdoor pools was heated but still a bit chilly for me!Lovely spa too.  New Year’s Eve had fireworks too!Highly recommended will be there again this Christmas!
Jul 2018,20,Very pleased,"From walking through large glass doors to reception to leaving 10 days later everything was lmpressive, from a more than satisfactory room with maidservice second to none (the chocolates offered each evening went down a treat) to the variety of food offered at the buffet restaurant and the view from our room, made our stay one to re ender."
Jul 2018,30,It’s not 5 star it’s the little things,"This hotel could be perfect. It’s a very family oriented hotel with no real couples here, you can’t swim in the pools as the kids are playing which is fine if you don’t advertise the hotel as perfect for couples as well. Dinner which was lovely included a young child playing her recorder on the next table .., there are some great restaurants with in a 20 min walk. we had to check out of our apartment we discovered by 10 am on the Sunday and when we asked for a short extension we were met with a shrug. It’s not really 5 star but it could be.."
Jul 2018,40,Nice hotel but not 5*,We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in june a group of 5 girls. We asked for 2 rooms together but were put in the apartments 3 of us and the othe 2 in the hotel 5 mins away if we had been told this before our trip we would have paid extra for 2 apartments. The hotel was 4* the apartments maby a 3* very basic and not comfortable beds. There was very few sun loungers around the pool so we had to buy lilos to lie out from the shop. Not really what you would expect after paying for a 5* hotel. Also paid for the breakfast and it wasnt nice we had to eat out instead. If you are looking to be within walking distance of shops restaurants stay else where nearest shop is 20 min walk and everything else is a taxi ride away
Jul 2018,40,Good family holiday but could be better,"Spent 10 nights here on a family holiday, in general the hotel is good.  We stayed in one of the apartments which suited us well, apartments are well equipped and gives you that extra space that yo7 don’t have with a hotel room which is good if you are travelling with children.I would of given the resort a score of 5 but for the few things that could of been better.1. Only one restaurant open even though 3 were advertised on booking and the food in the restaurant that was open was of poor quality nothing for children even though it says this a family resort.2. No night entertainment for children, just a singer in the bar each night.3. Only pool bar open was at the main pool at the hotel, the bars near the apartment pools where closed even though these areas where busy.Positive points1. The shuttle bus to the old town.2. Staff are excellent and always willing to help, the cleaning staff do an excellent job one of the cleanest hotels I have stayed in.3. Beach close by and easily accessible.I would stay here again but hope they can get their act together concerning dining and entertainment."
Jul 2018,50,Wonderful family detsination,"Overall a very suitable destination for families. Offers a relaxing environment with sufficient activities within the resort and on the beach to cater for all family members, away from the hustle and bustle of the town (although still easily accessible by a 5 minute taxi ride costing 5-6 Euros).Positives:- Kids club was pleasantly beyond our expectations. They had the children joyfully busy all day- Proximity to the beach- Several pools located throughout the resort- Housekeeping was very efficient.- Extremely helpful staff who accommodated all our requests. A special thanks to Mr. Joao Cruz the front desk manager who was always there to help and make spot-on recommendations.Only one minor negative point; not a huge issue, but I guess the timetable of the shuttle bus to the old town should be extended beyond 6pm"
Jul 2018,50,Beautiful place,"We have been coming here for over 4 years, it is a great location and if you want to see more the bus service is great from the hotel itself.  Room service is second to none. Reception is always helpful and polite , overall nothing is to much.  The beach is on your doorstep and beautiful. Every meal has been lovely and the drinks and service are very good quality. Love coming back as I know I will have a lovely holiday"
Jun 2018,40,Ann,"We returned here after visiting ladt year however after checking in and being told there was a choice of 3 restaurants there was only actually one.  The pergola restaurant and santa eulalia restaurant which we had been looking forward to using were closed for the whole duration due to ""technicaL problems"" Not happy that we werent told what these were and that we had to leave the hotel every night to eat out as the only remaining  restaurant wasn't what we fancied"
Jun 2018,40,Holiday,"We visited the hotel for the 2nd time in two years.  The location of the hotel is fabulous and last year we did not leave the resort for 7 days as the food, location and kid club was excellent.  This year we arrived in June and to our disbelief the same activities, food and entertainment was not in place despite the hotel being full!  Really disappointing as we had to leave the resort and find dinner options further afield.  Albufeira (hell) is only ten minutes away which we visited on one night but never again.  Would visit the hotel again but only on the pre text that everything is open and running.."
Jun 2018,40,"Lovely hotel, not quite 5 star","We had a lovely holiday here. I was not at all impressed with Albufeira itself (lager lout hell) but the hotel was an oasis away from the tackiness.  We stayed in a sea view (worth the extra money) one bedroom suite. The rooms very  clean, very spacious and with a little hallway and two doors separating the sitting room from the bedroom, it was perfect for us and our teenage son. He even had his own bathroom! The breakfast was very good except for the cooked meats but I think that’s just down to the fact that irish sausages and bacon are better than those on the continent. A chef made omelettes to order every morning which I thought was a nice touch. I liked the coffee (my husband didn’t).  Lunches were good and the pool bar did even cheaper options on filled rolls and sandwiches etc. We only ate dinner once at the hotel. It was good but there are better restaurants for dinner just outside the resort (the portobello across the road is excellent). The pool was lovely if a little cold and it was great having access directly to the small beach. Unfortunately our air conditioning wasn’t working during our stay and couldn’t be repaired!! That coupled with the somewhat dated decor in parts of the hotel stopped me giving 5 stars. I’d still recommend this hotel!"
Jun 2018,50,Very happy with my holiday.,Firstly i was very impressed with how we were welcomed at the reception and how we were golf carted out to our apartment.The apartment was amazing and very spacious! Very neat and tidy. The kitchen however was very confusing until i got the hang of using the stove and the microwave. As we were on self catering sometimes we would go out to eat around the strip or have room service! Room service was always amazing! They would come in and lay a table cloth on the table and lay all your food on the table. Personally ive never had room service to do that before so i loved it! It came to the day of my birthday! After a long day at Slide & Splash we came back to our apartment and was very surprised to see on the table a bottle of champagne and a birthday cake for me with a candle on it and also a birthday card from the staff! I nearly cried! Ive never had anyone do that for me before. I appreciated it so much and it made my day! Thank you so much! Overall our experience was amazing and the staff were amazing! I would definately come back for sure! Thank you for making our holiday even more perfect!
Jun 2018,40,Nice Hotel but not 5 star,"The hotel was well situated looking over its own bay. First impressions was good as we pulled into the drive and reception. We had a sea view room which was spacious, clean and comfortableBreakfast was nice in the light and clean restaurant especially the pastries which have made a mess of my waistline. The evening meals however was far from a 5 star standard. Only a small serving pass made for some queue dodgers and we thought the choice was small. The quality of the food was ok but only ok. We had to complain on the second day due to flies around the food but to the credit of the duty manager, she was very apologetic and sorted the problem for us. Apparently there had been an invasion due to the change in the weather. Oh and we did notice they didn't seem to cater for the kids. No chips, pizza etc. Didn't bother us but did the younger ones want to eat rice or pasta every night ??The A La Carte menu is well worth a try. This food IS  5 star standardMost of the waiters/waitresses are very pleasant and quick to serve or clean your tables.The pool area is ok but busy with the normal 7.00am towel carriers heading for the sunbeds lol.We found a nice spot on a grassed area next to the beach. great for people watchingThe beach bar serves good food in the afternoon and even better ice creamThe free shuttle bus to the new and old towns are handy although the walk isn't too bad - 30minsOverall the hotel was comfortable and value for money but is was only half full. I wonder what the restaurant and pool areas are like in mid July or August"
Jun 2018,40,Our stay ,The staff at this hotel is most definitely 5 star they are top notch and well go all out for you.. the hotel it's self is nice and well kept but in need of an update the food is good and the beer is cold and the views are fab the rooms are big but out dated but very clean I would stay here again my kids loved it
Jun 2018,40,Beautiful hotel in stunning location.,"I am still at hotel. Unfortunately go home Tuesday. Wish had booked 10 days now. Not sure about 5 star, apart from the staff who are the most professional and lovely people. 5 star service always in reception at the bar. Can't do enough for you. Staying in apartment which has everything you could possibly want.HD golf buggy ride with our cases to the appartment. Awesome touch. Oh and the cocktails whilst expensive in the bar, are amazing and served with freebie nibbles. Worth every penny. Stunning location beach front and great shuttle bus service to old town. If you are self catering don't go to first supermarket you find. Turn left out of entrance gate walk 15 mins and u will come across big intermarche with great value fresh produce. Proper supermarket. You can buy a fresh cooked whole piri piri chicken for under 4 euros so dining in can be done very cheaply. Make your own freshly squeezed juice in there too. Local wines lovely and asittle as 4 euro!! Highly recommend the restaurant on walk up there called casa velha for the 12.95 euro tourist menu. We had basket of bread and olives and a mixed salad starter, piri piri chicken with chips and salad, cheesecake, coffee, a port type shot and a free beer. 4 of us came to just under 52 euro and boy we were full! They serve fast between courses though!! Martins just left out of entrance also a good choice and lovely service but expect to pay easily double. The only negatives where 5 star fails here is that pool side bars all closed down, except for main pool by reception. Look like they need a good refurb too. And very disappointing that only the main breakfast restaurant open and the snack bar restaurant toward beach for sandwiches. Other hotel restaurants closed down too and no gourmet burger restaurant in site. Not quite as the hotel description for facilities. Apartments only have two chairs outside and we are a party of 3 adults! All in all though I will definitely be coming back. I don't want to leave. Oh and cleaners are incredibly hardworking and deserve a big thank you. Immaculately clean always. Fantastic holiday xxx"
Jun 2018,40,"Good Hotel for a family holiday, could be better though","We stayed in a 1 bed room self catering villa, it was great. Clean and well equipped, maid service was very good even when the little one had an “accident” during a nap they came with new sheets straight away. My only negative on the villa was it didn’t have a view from the balcony/veranda we was at the back so just facing other villas. The facilities are great, I enjoyed a great massage in the spa. Heated swimming pool was ideal and the pool area is beautiful with great sea views, plenty of parasols. Annoyingly you did need to get up early with your towels to guarantee a bed at the main pool area and that was in June I suspect at peak times it’s even harder. The pools at the villas were quieter. Entertainment was the issue for us there’s a singer in the bar which is great for adults but nothing for children after 6pm despite the numerous reviews stating this it doesn’t look like it’s going to change anytime soon. The location isn’t perfect either, it’s a 15 minute walk along a grim looking main road to the new town. There’s a free shuttle but it’s every 2 hours and stops at 6pm. In the end we found an Uber to the old town was the best way it only cost €4 each way.The New town was a little too much like Benidorm for us, drunken stag /hen parties and drink promotions everywhere plus your standard “British” bars. The Old town was more pleasant and more suited for families. In truth we found Albufeira to be too commercialised by the British, Vilamoura just down the road was a lot more picturesque. In summary fantastic hotel and facilities, just not resort we really expected."
Jun 2018,50,Friends wedding,We had a great stay here at this hotel for our friends wedding. We spent a lot the time down by the beach next to the hotel but the pool area was lovely also. Food at breakfast was nice and there was always a table free. The hotel is also walking distance to the strip of bars and to the old town. All in all we really enjoyed staying here
Jun 2018,40,Asset is beach and breakfast,"Stayed in a single room which was quite basic for a 5* hotel. No kettle which would have been nice. Room very clean and bed comfortable.Breakfast was excellent great choice for everyone . Plenty of fresh fruit, fresh bread, croissants and pastry and cooked food. You can even ask to get an omelette cooked fresh.There's a gorgeous beach about 5 minutes from hotel with lovely cafe beside it. Prices reasonable in cafe.only negative is it closes at 6 pm. Staff very friendly especially Jorge"
Jun 2018,50,Great resort for family holiday,Stayed at the hotel in June and already want to go back. Location is perfect with amazing beach on your doorstep. Plenty of pools so none feel too packed. Stayed in a one bed apartment which worked out perfect for two adults and two small kids. Breakfast was excellent and dinner also good (only starts at 7pm so not great for young kids). Staff very friendly also.
Jun 2018,40,Overall very good,"Stayed here with extended family for 7 nights. Lovely resort with access to beach providing a haven from the rowdy town of Albufeira. We had a spacious, spotlessly clean, sea-view one bedroom suite. The separate sitting room with fold out double sofa bed and second bathroom made an excellent private second bedroom for our teenage son. The breakfast was very good, apart from the sausages and bacon which I found greasy and gross!!! €9 bought a hearty lunch of a filled baguette/toastie and chips or large salad. The evening buffet was a bit hit and miss. (There’s a great Italian restaurant called the Portobello right across the road from the entrance to Grand Eulalia). The staff are very friendly and helpful from the pool cafe staff to the reception staff. The only real downside for us was that the air conditioning didn’t work in our room for the duration of our stay. Other relatives mentioned that their air conditioning didn’t work either so that might be something  to check with the hotel about before booking. Would have loved some padding or a mattress on the sun loungers (most 5 star resorts have these). Overall this is a friendly, clean and spacious seafront property which ticks most of the boxes. I’d give it a 4 star rating overall. It’s not total luxury but it’s a very good place to stay."
Jun 2018,30,Nice hotel,"Lovely setting on the beach.  Nice rooms,    Breakfast good.   Transport buses, taxis and car spaces great.  Food ok.  Drinks in the bar very expensive.    12 Eur for 2 Small glasses of local port.  A Bottle of port can be  bought for less than 5eur in the supermarket"
Jun 2018,50,Family holiday ,"Had a lovely holiday here in June.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, especially on reception and the pool bar.  The food in the restaurant is good and nothing is too much bother, if there isn’t something there they will try and accommodate you.  However, there is not much option in the evening for younger children.  The rooms could do with a bit of touching up, however the maids do a wonderful job cleaning  and keep the rooms really clean with fresh linen and towels every day.  We had a sea view room.  The hotel is situated on a beautiful beach and they have a beach cafe and there is a small shop on the beach.  There are a few restaurants close by and a supermarket.  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to Albufeira new town and old town every two hours until 6.25pm and then a taxi back will cost around €7 from the old town.The entertainment is good, there is a singer on most nights.There are a few pools scattered around, however there is only one heated pool, so it gets a bit crowded as the other pools were quite cold, which was my only issue at the hotel.  There are free towels for the pool and beach.I would recommend a stay here, we enjoyed it."
Jun 2018,50,A fabulous place,"What can I say about this place other than its fabulous. I haven't been on a package holiday for seventeen years, always choosing to go to Asia because of the European package holiday negativity from days gone by when allocation on arrival was en vogue and holidays were cheap. I'm so glad things have changed. Both Jet2 and Santa Eulalia made this week's holiday an absolute dream. They're incredibly well organised, helpful, approachable, sincere and professional. From the moment we arrived at Manchester airport to the moment we came back, nothing was too much trouble and everything was brilliantly communicated in terms of pick up times, excursions etc. The staff at Santa Eulalia are incredible, even sending me a cake and wine for my birthday via room service because they happened to notice my date of birth on my passport. If that was a ploy to get me to go back, it worked. We'll be going back to this same resort next year. The room was perfect, incredibly clean and you can just tell that the owners and managers of the resort and indeed Jet2 have thought things through and ensure you can just relax and enjoy your holiday. Nothing is too much trouble for them. Well impressed in summary, well done Santa Eulalia and Jet2, you surpassed my expectations and thankyou for treating me like a valued customer. It was a break my wife and I really needed and you made it a special one."
Jun 2018,40,Great couples break,"Lovely room with comfortable bed. We went for the Bed and Breakfast, there were lots of different food choices at breakfast. Love;y staff very helpful and friendly. Pool side was nice. Had dinner in fish restaurant a couple of times which was delicious, thoroughly enjoyed this break,"
Jun 2018,50,Loved this hotel ,"From the moment   we got there I felt comfortable, the staff are so welcoming and helpful , showed us all we needed to know about our room , we opted for the bed and breakfast board which was perfect for us and the breakfast selection was huge , I ate far to much ! At the start of the week getting by the pool was no problem but as we came to the end of our holiday it was getting busy and the same old reserving your bed early had to be done , but this is the case everywhere I have been. We used the cafe along the front for lunch as the view was so pretty and food was quick and good, in the evenings we went out a 15 min walk to new town. We would then come back to hotel for one of their cocktails which were lovely , the bar in the hotel is a little pricey but again it’s a hotel and to be expected , the staff there were very busy but again very polite and always had a smile for you .our bed in our room was amazing it was a queen size bed and this is the first time I haven’t craved for my own bed.  So overall I liked this hotel a lot , right on the beach , pool area is nice , staff are great , easy to get to old and new towns , our room was kept spotless , we hope to be back again , thank you"
Jun 2018,30,Average Hotel,"We stayed in the GRSE as we were getting married in Portugal. Having stayed in a suite which was dated, dirty floors and cracked tiles, we thought this was bad. We then split our stay  and stayed in an apartment for 6 nights , Well we will most defiantly not be back. The rooms were an absolute disgrace.  The floors were disgusting, our balcony was disgusting and full of debris and dirt. The paint on the walls was crumbling off, our hanger in the wardrobe fell off. Having got married in another 5* during that stay, it is clear this is 100% not a 5* hotel. it needs alot of money invested in it because it is very dated and to be at the level of the other 5* hotels in Portugal."
Jun 2018,50,Great for quiet relaxing ,I am currently in this hotel on a bed and breakfast basis staying in a studio apartment.Arrived at the hotel Saturday at 1pm thinking we would have to wait 4pm to gain entry to room. Room was ready. The room was situated close to main gate 5 minutes walk to main hotel. It was peaceful and quiet and a sun trap come afternoon. The room is spotlessly cleaned. Clean towels daily and sheets changed every second day. Sorry and thank you to the cleaning lady who washed my dishes I was outside having lunch. The rooms are perfect if you plan to self cater. Everything looked new.Breakfast is what you expect and lots of choice. The resort is beautiful though didn’t spend a lot of time in the hotel as like to explore. The staff were friendly and hardworking. They can organise taxis if you don’t want to use courtesy bus or miss last one €4 to new town €7 to old Albufeira.Would recommend this hotel to families and couples. I would definitely return.
Jun 2018,30,Little Disappointing,We arrived at the hotel early and my husband had emailed ahead asking could we perhaps check in early as I was 5 months pregnant. Unfortunately this was not possible. Upon our stay I asked for an iron twice I was assured it would be brought to my room this never happened and no tea/ coffee facilities available in our room. As a 5 star hotel I expected a little more. Also I felt the dining experiences in the hotel were very expensive compared to the rest of the resort. The food was basic for the price being charged. However the staff were very welcoming the hotel was very clean and the overall experience good.
Jun 2018,50,Still as good as ever!,"Not the hotels fault that the wind was whistling round our ears!Other than that the staff were excellent, the room ready when we arrived, the breakfasts were amazing. It’s a super hotel within comfortable distance of Albufeira but without the noise!I would thoroughly recommend it."
Jun 2018,10,"Dated, Slow Service, Poor Food Options","What a letdown this place was! My room was in ""the apartments"", a five minute walk from the main hotel, but backed up against local housing where the kids from outside th property were up screaming every day at 6am. The room was dated and mildewy. The food was sub-par in selection and quality from every other European resort that I stayed at. The restaurant hostess was abrasive at times and did not give off a friendly vibe. My first day at breakfast, after seating me, I got up to get food and came back to find my table re-sat with other people. Checkout was a nightmare...stood in line for 15 minutes while only 3 people were trying to check out in front of me, and had to leave in order to not miss my train. Two of those people were trying to switch the billing to credit cards other than the one they held the room with, and the staff acted like this was the first time they had ever experienced something like this. At the train station I ran into several others who had been staying at this property for our conference and heard that many people had extra charges added to their bill. Still waiting to get mine emailed from the hotel. Much better options in the the Algarve than this property."
Jun 2018,10,Give it a miss,"If you’re looking for a great place to stay in the area, give this one a miss. Had to change rooms after the first night as the one we were in smelled bad, no cushions on any of the club chairs, minimal activities  and the staff were miserable. Booked for 7-nights and checked out after 3 with no reimbursement. Have been to 90-countries and stayed at a lot of hotels, this one won’t be revisited. Other guests we talked to were saying how disappointed they were too."
Jun 2018,50,Fantastic ,Just back... Hotel is amazing everyone in the hotel work so hard to make you happy will definitely Be coming back the only think I found was the price of drinks very expensive but all in all fantastic hotel would recommend this hotel to anyone thank you for an amazing stay
Jun 2018,50,Family holiday,"Booked an apartment in this hotel and asked for pool view and got an apartment right beside pool,so handy with young children and never too busy,apartment itself was lovely and spotless,cleaned everyday.the Wi-Fi was great with young kids and some stations were we could watch films and programmes.the free bus down to old town was great service and lovely resteraunt just outside called Martin's.the holiday was a joy due to staying in these apartments,all the home comforts and kids loved it here,definetly be back and would definetly give it 5 star review,staff very friendly and view out near bar having a drink amazing,5 minute walk to beach."
Jun 2018,50,Lovely as always ,"We had our wedding here in May 2017 & went back to celebrate our 1st anniversary in May 2018. Our wedding was perfect, the setting is stunning & our guests were so impressed! The hotel helped organise everything & I mean everything!! Nothing was too much trouble for Angela & Patricia even recommending celebrants, lawyers, make up artists & florists. We could not believe our luck. The day was perfect. Our return visit this year was every bit as good if just a little quieter without 70 of our nearest & dearest! We got to explore more of the hotel, resort amenities & beach this time, even more to love! The hotel even had complimentary champagne in our room....even more to love! The hotel & rooms are spotless, the buffet breakfast is outstanding, there is so much to choose from...or have a wee bit of everything lol! There’s even prosecco on offer at that time of the morning if the notion takes you?! I like the fact that it’s away from the old & new town - means you can visit there if you like & then chill back at the hotel. A taxi is about €7 but there is a shuttle bus from the hotel. It’s walkable too 45mins (25 min run) to the old town & about 15 to the strip/new town. The lovely little town of Olhos De Auga is about 20 mins to the right of the hotel. It has a beautiful wee beach & some very good restaurants/bars etc. I couldn’t recommend this resort highly enough!! I look forward to spending many more anniversaries here."
Jun 2018,50,Fabulous !,"We had the pleasure of spending 5 days here last month.This is a really lovely hotel. We found it to be low key very relaxed and chilled. We had a garden room. It was large and very comfortable with a huge bathroom and an excellent shower. The standard of housekeeping in the room was second to none, with two daily visits. The standard of cleanliness throughout the hotel and grounds was very impressive. Staff were, without exception, pleasant helpful and eager to please, meaning the service in all areas was of a very high standard. Really impressive.The grounds are beautiful, all the way down to the beach. Pool area lovely. The food was nice, maybe not completely to my personal taste, but that’s just me, my partner enjoyed it. There was plenty to choose from and we found the dining room not too busy. There isn’t much within walking distance nearby, but the hotel run an excellent bus service into town every day. Taxis were also cheap enough to use often.We loved this hotel, and would certainly recommend it to anyone, whatever age, who is looking for a peaceful relaxing few days away, being looked after by a team of very professional, hard working people. Not forgetting, In the most gorgeous surroundings !!"
Jun 2018,40,Lovely spacious hotel,"The hotel is approx 30 mins away from the airport in a taxi. Check in was quick and easy and we were taken to our rooms via golf buggy. Our one bedroom apartment had a typical Portuguese decor which was lovely and was very spacious with a large terrace to sit out - we were ground floor (the biggest apartment we have stayed in). Travel cot provided and a high chair delivered free on request. All amenities provided to cook in the apartment should you wish. A couple of supermarkets close by for bread, milk, beer etc. Lots of pools to sit around and a heated pool in the main hotel area by the pool bar. A 5/5 would have been given if the pool bars were open around the other pools but they looked closed for good. A few drinks and bar snacks by the pool would have been perfect however we just made our own sandwiches and brought our own drinks to the pool area. Very close to the beach and a lovely beach it is with water sports available. The hotel bar/restaurant overlooking the beach was very nice although not the cheapest (€6 for a glass of wine). The beach bar on the beach was cheap and cheerful if wanting a drink and a bar snack (€10 for 2 toasties and 2 beers - very reasonable).10-15 minute walk to the strip (new town) with many bars and restaurants to choose from. The Chinese at the roundabout is cheap and awesome food, also try Sizzling stone restaurant (straight on at the roundabout on the right hand side).The hotel provides a free bus to the old town 5 times a day. The old town is lovely and well worth a visit. We also walked a 25 min walk to olhos d’agua (opposite direction to the strip). A small town nearby with a few restaurants to eat dinner or tea. We arranged our transport to and from the airport with Portuguese firm yellow fish online prior to flying out, I would highly recommend this firm (car seat provided for our 8 month old). €85 return for a minibus for 7 people. Overall, we would definitely return to this lovely hotel should we return to Portugal."
Jun 2018,50,Family Wedding,"Absolutely beautiful complex. Next to the beach and set in lovely grounds with three pools, beach bar and kids play area. Me and hubbue stayed in a studio apartment which was spacious, clean and had pretty much everything we needed. Nice added touch of dressing gowns,shampoos etc. The room was cleaned daily and fresh towels were provided daily if you wanted them,Beach towels are also provided.It was a good 15 minuted to the strip but we don’t mind a walk so that want a problem. There’s a supermarket and a couple of restaurants close by if you don’t fancy the trek. The wedding was amazing - food and staff great. Would definitely stay there again . Ideal for couples and families."
May 2018,40,Beautiful resort with private beach,"The resort is grande as it’s name . Well spread out rooms and apartment style accommodations which were very spacious separate living dining kitchen area with crockery cutlery provided . It’s ideal if you kids , you can cook there or warm up food.Beach side there is an area for the hotel guests and another area where you have to pay 5 Euros for the chair and another 5 for umbrella.May was still too cold to swim but still we had a good time as we were spending quality family time together.Shuttle buses are available for drops to old and new town."
May 2018,30,Lovely location but not 5 star,Chose  the hotel for its spa and location- but disappointed with the spa- 20 euros per day and the spa was not fully functional - only offered 2 Euro discount!Pools were really coldBreakfast was lovely with a huge choice of fresh fruit and hot food.However the dinner buffet was not great- food was lukewarm and the choice was not as great as other 5 star hotels I have stayed in.The staff are lovely and friendly.
May 2018,20,Grande Unrealistic ...,"Was very much looking forward to enjoying a well deserved break away, with the family. But what we got was far from it.What hotel that dares to consider itself a five staff resort, thinks that it is ok to hold a corporate event in the middle of the main lobby / reception area and not in a designated suite, forcing its holidaying guests to such an welcoming experience, that they need to leave the resort, just to spend quality family time together. Shame on the management and shame on the staff for treating returning guests in such a fashion.When we arrived, we were told that half the restaurants were closed and as we were really looking forward to one in particular, you can imagine our disgust, when we see it being opened for the corporate people.Do you not think it honourable to inform guests upon check in of what their week would entail?And do you not think it loyal to guests staying in the hotel to be treated to maybe small discount in the spa etc, over those that can freely stroll through the front gate?It will be the last time that we will come to this hotel, quite frankly this is not a five star resort, 3.5 to 4 max, but definitely not a 5 and the attitude that it has shown this week places it even lower in my humble estimation.Others may have a different opinion on their experience at Grande Real Santa Eulália and that’s their right, but that’s why it’s called a review."
May 2018,30,Great location but only 3 star,"We recently stayed at the resort. We could not find availability through the hotel's website so booked through Alpharooms. We booked a studio apt with breakfast. It was not made clear that the apartments were separate from the hotel. We had in fact wished to book a hotel room but there were none available which on arrival we figured was due to a conference in the hotel the week we were there.The location is great. Short stroll to the beach. Beach is lovely. Great little beach cafe and some pedal boats and sunbeds etc available.Pool area in hotel side of resort nice. Food not great in pool bar. Pools are freezing. One was heated but not through the entirety of our stay and still quite cool. Decking around pools was being revarnished while we were there and was cordoned off for 3 days making it hard to access pools plus the smell was overbearing so we went to beach. The day after the work was finished the decking was still tacky to walk on.Pool areas on apartment side not as well maintained. Chipped tiles in pool. Decking looks a bit worse for wear. Pool bar not open.Very clinical feel to hotel and definitely more a business hotel than family friendly.Food at breakfast good. Fresh fruit, usual continental and hot food. Lovely cheeses.Studio apartment was good size. Good kitchen area. Well stocked with appliances and cutlery etc. Towels were changed daily and beds made. However it is very dated and as seen in previous review pictures the decor is dated and colours a bit odd. The curtains didn't fully close on the sliding doors. The fly curtains were ripped. The curtains were hanging from rail in places. Weird stains/drip marks on top of walls. Bed linen stained. Brown blankets on bed which are a massive No No for me and not something you would expect in a 5 star resort.Pillows were flat and soft.  Bed really hard.Don't think floor was ever mopped as my 4 year olds feet were black after a few minutes on the first day so he never went without flip flops inside.Would return to the area but unfortunately not to this hotel."
May 2018,50,Fabulous return trip to Grande Real,"This was our second stay at the Grande Real. On arrival we got an upgrade to a suite. It was just fantastic. Two double rooms, both ensuite, one with a jacuzzi.Even though our trip was January the weather was lovely and we enjoyed the outdoor heated pool. We enjoyed daily walks on the fabulous beach adjoining the hotel. We stayed half board on this occasion and enjoyed breakfast every day, somedays opting for lunch and somedays dinner. Food was delicious, with a good choice for vegetarians. The burger bar was closed the week we stayed so we did miss that and look forward to dining their on our return.We returned from our trip energised and very relaxed. A perfect way to break up our long winter. We have already booked our next visit. We would like to take time to compliment the entire team at the hotel. Friendly, warm and helpful. We have definitely found our home away from home at the Grande Real S. E."
May 2018,40,"Lovely peaceful setting, right on the beach","We had a great deal in September, the hotel and seaview room were great, fantastic choice at breakfast, and very fresh. At this time of year be aware that not all facilities are open, the nightclub looks fantastic right on the beach but was not open when we were there and only one bar open. A short walk to the bars and restaurants and there is a courtesy bus to take you into Albufeira. Local busses are easy to use, there is a stop just outside the grounds, to Albufeira or Villamora."
May 2018,10,Bad and dirty,Well once again due to business I stayed here. The hotel exterior is lovely even the houses are gorgeous and well maintained but the interior is bad and every year it seems to be worse. Lots of hairs on the floor and in the bed as you can see in the photos. No WiFi reception. Totally a nightmare. It really needs some updates
May 2018,30,5 STAR LOCATION NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL,"loved the setting of this hotel the grounds and views were outstanding but this is were the 5 star rating ended.  The hotel was very quiet at night as entertainment was limited.  The hotel holds a lot of conferences during the day.  We chose bed and breakfast as the hotel had various restaurants so we thought there would be a good choice to pick from.  Went to the burger restaurant one night to find it was closed, a member of staff said it would be closed for a month to cater for weddings, this meant every night we went outside the hotel to eat.  There was a buffet restaurant which cost 60 euro per couple but as the breakfast was of poor quality we decided against trying it.  On the subject of breakfast it was poor never hot and always overcooked.  There is a bus to take you into Albufeira but this stopped at 6.15 and I must say the bus driver was the rudest man I have ever come across.  The hotel is a bit tired with no soul, sorry I would not return."
May 2018,30,Kids paradise,We are still here and what we thought was going to be a relaxing holiday with our friends is actually turning out to be hard work.The resort is great for young children and not for couples .There have also been conferences on most days with delegates children running around screaming even at 9.30pm in the restaurant !!!!!The rooms are lovely and we are enjoying some of the food even though its not kept hot enough.The evening entertainment is limited but nice enough bar/lounge areas.Not much atmosphere .Could do with softer lighting!The staff are friendly and polite.If there are kettles available it would help if this was made aware in the hotel amenities section.Lovely hotel but not for us.
May 2018,50,Enjoyable Second Visit,"We love the self catering apartments here. They are in a good location with the hotel facilities and the beach close to hand. We made use of the restaurant on the beach front, enjoying the great views and reasonable prices for food and drinks. The apartments are well stocked and so on but take your own tin opener! We hired a car this time and parking in the underground car-park was easy enough, keeping the car cool. There was always space but might get busy in peak season.Our apartment was kept clean and stocked by Svetlana. There was a language barrier but she was genuinely pleased to see us again. She is a lovely person and takes pride in her job.The reception staff are very professional and helpful. It's a pleasure staying here and we are already looking at returning again next year.Booking trips and hiring a car is easy. Reception will assist you or you can go out of the gate and turn right. You'll find a small ""portacabin"" building on the left, which offers trips and so on. We hired our car with them, using Panda car hire. Petrol is a bit more expensive than here but it's relatively easy to drive in Portugal. Assuming reasonable mobility, there are other restaurants and supermarkets within easy walking distance too but early May can still be a bit cool in the mornings and evenings."
May 2018,50,Perfect quiet holiday,Fantastic resort. A little away from the hustle and bustle. We stayed in one bed apartment it had everything. The little touches like a kids dressing robe and kids soap in bathroom. The cleaner was amazing came everyday and we were messy with 2 kids. There was plenty of seats at pool and kids pool was perfect for toddlers. Main pools were a bit cool. Direct access to the beach to which is great could spend one half of day on beach other by pool. Reception staff were warm in friendly on check in we were a bit tired and cranky at 10pm with a 4 and 2 year old.they rushed everything along. No need for towels as the hotel provides them. Also Wi-Fi in hotel and apartments was great. The only down side was the distance to town and it was up and down hill. There was a shuttle bus to old and new town but last bus was 6.25 and no return for that time. Taxi was between 7 and 8 euro from old town.
May 2018,50,Excellent!!,"The hotel is beautiful and immaculately clean, the rooms are cleaned daily and the maid even washed our babies bottles out for us which was lovely, we stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment which we couldnt fault, huge bed, decent size bathroom and living areas and good facilities, the staff in the hotel are excellent and do the best to help you in anyway possible. There are a few pools to choose from and it is located right on the beach, the only downside to the hotel is it is located quite a distance from the new and old town, they do provide a free shuttle bus but we just used taxis costing 10 euros per trip  to the old town. All in all a well managed and beautiful hotel where nothing is too much trouble, would most definately  recommend!"
May 2018,50,Perfect setting for a Wedding,"My Son had his wedding here and it was Amazing , they couldn't have picked a better place . If you want a holiday with no worries , every thing to hand , and 5 star luxury , This Is the place for you . Staff are fantastic , and the Food , it matches everything else , Amazing"
May 2018,50,conference,stayed in the hotel during conference for 7 nights.Stayed in suite with view to the pool and sea.A very nice resort close to the sea.excellent very big beds.Conference area and rooms very good.Very good breakfast.
May 2018,40,Lovely place,"Our first visit to the Algarve staying at the Grande Real for 10 nights on a self catering basis. To be honest, we found our accommodation and the hotel facilities to be faultless. The staff and service was just delightful. Absolutely no trouble to do anything for their guests. The room we had was lovely and kept spitlesslt clean by the daily maid service. Plenty of pools to choose from and easy access to the beach. Car hire was organised by the staff and we also used the free bus into the old town. I would definitely recommend the hotel and accommodation to anyone wanting good facilities in a central location."
May 2018,30,Below the expectations...,"Stunning location by the sea.The rooms need refurbishment and modernization. On the ground floor, facing the entrance, you cannot have the windows open because there’s no privacy...Breakfast was not 5 stars..."
May 2018,40,Short Break,"Myself, partner & toddler really enjoyed our short break at this resort. The hotel arranged taxis via May which were excellent & reliable. We stayed in an apartment on the resort which was large, clean & comfortable. The food in the restaurants was very good. Access to pools & beach & facilities were excellent. We loved this hotel by day but by night it was very drab and boring. The ‘Real Bar ‘ entertainment was 1 man with a guitar who was easy listening but we were lulled to sleep by 10 each night. Free Shuttle bus to old town for evening meals was preferable than staying in hotel as there was more of an atmosphere."
May 2018,40,Good value for money but not 5 stars ,"I got a good deal on a package holiday here so can’t complain about value for money, however I would say the hotel is not 5 date as advertised. Perfectly nice, but apartments are definitely more 3 star, and pool areas 4 star. Only real issue I had was with the food served at the resort - very underwhelming and overpriced. But otherwise had a good trip."
May 2018,50,Short break,"What a great hotel, our stay has been lovely , the staff are excellent and nothing is to much bother.Breakfast is not rushed and a good selection.We also had something to eat by the pool and a Buffett meal in the evening.They also have a free bus service to visit old and new town.And great private beach.The only thing missing is tea and coffee making facilities in the room.Which is our preference.We will definitely be coming back to this lovely hotel.Thank you for a wonderful stay."
May 2018,50,"Pretty, pretty good",A fine international hotel indeed. Room spotlessly clean.Staff always greet you with a smile. Nice swimming pool area with outside bar. Choice of restaurants in the hotel.If the only thing I can find to complain about is the luke warm porridge at breakfast then I think we made a great hotel choice.Beach is easily accessible from the hotel with sun beds for hire near the beach bar (not run by the hotel).We would stay here again without hesitation.
May 2018,10,5 star definitely no more than a 3,"Very very disappointed we booked this hotel as it was advertised as a 5 star. Definitely no more than a 3 star. Clientele definitely only a 3 star standard all on Cheap bargain breaks from uk ,,,,,Hotel definitely needs to be refurbished and re rated..."
May 2018,40,Good for families,"Recently stayed for a week the facilities are good if a little dated. The location of the hotel is ideal for families, I found all the staff very friendly and the food was good that was served in all of the restaurants. The only negative I could say were the beds were not that comfortable!! All in all we would return again."
May 2018,50,review of hotel,"Hotel in general is perfect! The staff is absolutely amazing - very friendly, always ready to help, nice personality!Amenities are good, food also good, may be will be better to have more variety of hot dishes during breakfast.The only discomfort was - inability of getting satisfaction from swimming - ocean in May is extremely  cold and water in swimming pools were also cold, so may be in future hotel thinks to have even one pool with heated water, that will expand time of resort functioning..."
May 2018,50,Amazing stay 2nd year in a row,"What can I say!!  We have just returned from an amazing 10 day stay and from start to finish had the best time.  Myself, my husband, two small kids (4 and 5) and my parents are already looking forward to returning next May.  There are so many highlights.  The kids club was just incredible.  My kids were already looking forward to it from our trip last year and they ran in the first morning and every morning for the rest of their stay.  They loved all of the various activities and made lots of friends.  Marta, Telma, Jaoa, Paolo, Jessica, Ricardo and the rest of the team are so nice, so much fun and really made the holiday memorable for the kids and also gave us such peace of mind,  Telma babysat for us too on a number of occasions and was so kind and my daughter really looked forward to Telma babysitting.  My Mum and I availed of the fitness classes which Jaoa and Ricardo run twice a day.  They were excellent classes.  Whatever level of fitness you have is catered for and both trainers are highly experienced and fun.  I would definitely recommend them if you can tear yourself away from the sun loungers.  The reception staff are so friendly and helpful, particularly Jerome.  All of the restaurant staff are great.  We stayed in an apartment overlooking the pool and it was incredibly clean and cleaned daily which was brilliant.  My parents had a gorgeous sea view room in the hotel.  Overall, we had the most incredible relaxing, fun and enjoyable holiday and are already planning our return next May.  Thanks to all of the great staff for a memorable holiday.  We really appreciate it."
May 2018,50,Relaxed atmosphere is stunning surroundings,"The hotel upon arrival greeted us with a beautiful lobby and efficient staff. We were initially given a room with just a partial sea view and when I asked reception to change us to a more central sea view  they accommodated us immediately. They even suggest we go for lunch while they made arrangements and moved our bags for us. We were staying on a full board basis. Breakfast, lunch and dinner in the buffet restaurant. However we also received 1 dinner in the gourmet burger restaurant (fabulous) and 1 dinner in the Santa Eulália restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised with this as it broke up the buffet dinner dining. Also, the buffet restaurant turns al a carte at lunch with is very nice. I recommend the sea bream. The hotel offers private access to the public beach where beach beds can be rented for €15. Well worth it. You can leave your towels there and pop up to the restaurant for lunch then back to the beach. The views of the Atlantic are stunning. A beautiful sea breeze is always there to keep you cool. In general, the hotel is at the lower end of 5 stars but when compared with other available 5 star hotels in the area it offers good value. We decided to extend our stay by 2 nights and we were kindly offered the same room and a 10% discount (breakfast only). The hotel grounds are spacious enough that it never felt crowded. There is a free bus service 6 times a day that drops you directly at the beach in Albufeira Old Town if you feel like a change of scene. Saying that, there is little reason to leave the hotel if you’re just here to relax. The staff are very helpful, especially Manuela in the dining area. I will definitely be returning for another trip."
May 2018,50,Excellent Stay!,"Couldn't state any flaws, perfect in every sense for what a 5 star property speaks for!Very courteous staff and made our stay really special for daughter's birthday complimentary treat. Tried the seafood and burger restaurant and find them 10x better than what you get in the town areaand economical too! 100% recommended"
May 2018,30,Not entirely sure why it's 5*,"This all may sound negative but it isn't, it's not a bad hotel at all it just isn't amazing. We stayed for 4 nights self catering in one of the apartments, it was good don't get me wrong but for 5* you would expect a bit more. It's hard to put my finger on what was missing though...The 2 bedroom apartment was large and clean with good facilities but i've stayed in 3 and 4* self catering apartments which offered the same or similar. The decor was bright but random looking and dated, it was right outside one of the secluded apartment block pools which was nice.The pools... Well it's more a case of quantity over quality. It's so random to have 4 or 5 small circular pools, they weren't bad or anything negative about them but not exactly 5* at all.Pool bar drinks and snacks were okay, ordered a chicken baguette to be given a tuna baguette but it may have been the language barrier, wasn't too bothered and my order was changed within 5 minutes. It was okay, nothing too glamorous.The paid extra's on offer seemed good for someone wanting that sort of thing like the spa treatments etc. We wasn't interested in those but this is probably why it has a 5* rating along with the beach location which was really nice.The staff were exactly how you would expect because they're getting paid to provide a service, so they weren't bad or amazing. Just what you expect.Unless we were missing something and there was magical place on the evening which we couldn't find, there was absolutely nothing going on in the hotel in the night. It was bizarre and because the very good bus service ended around 6pm, we found ourselves walking 15 minutes to the nearest bars and restaurants (half way between the hotel and new town) and later onto the new town.Overall the stay was good, relaxing and we enjoyed it for a short break.Just not entirely sure about the 5* and maybe more in season (July/August) this place would be very good. Maybe i'm being picky with the average rating, just my opinion."
May 2018,40,Very relaxing and enjoyable,We came on a family holiday and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. We had to move rooms during our stay but this was handled very efficiently and without issue. All staff were helpful and friendly especially with the kids.
May 2018,50,"Fabulous Resort Hotel, wonderful staff","My daughter and I are halfway through our second visit to this beautiful splendid hotel, early May 2018. The staff are helpful and friendly. We were given a warm and unexpected personal welcome from Manager João Climaco while new and smiling staff member Jorge checked us in. João placed us in a spotlessly clean, spacious room on the top level with a panoramic view of the sea, tennis courts and woods from the balcony. We found a bottle of water and a bowl of fruit waiting for us on arrival.There is a fridge and a safe in the room and there is no extra charge or deposit required. The shower is powerful and fresh towels are abundant. The housekeeping staff do a great job and there is a daily turn-down service. There are a number of English speaking channels on the TV including the BBCs and cartoon network. Fresh towels for the pool are also provided daily, free of charge. Victor noticed us returning from the pool one day with folded wet towels and he had fresh towels waiting for us by the time we reached his desk- impressive. These are the details that make staying at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia such a pleasurable experience. Today we will take the complimentary shuttle bus to the Old Town. The bus is new, large and air conditioned. Every morning here we eat breakfast at what can only be described as a banquet, with a huge variety of tropical fruit, healthy options, cold meats, hot food, porridge, yoghurt, poached, scrambled, boiled or fried eggs, a variety of cheese, rolls, pastries, coffee, tea, chocolate and juices including freshly squeezed delicious orange juice. Yes of course the fry up is different to an Irish or English fry- after all, we are in another country! We enjoyed an evening meal at the Pergula Restaurant this week, very nice indeed. We usually eat early and so we dine outside at the Atlantico with a beach view and delicious options for a light meal-see the menu on the hotel's website. This closes at 6pm outside of high season so don't arrive after 5.30pm looking for food and also bear in mind that the pool bar also closes at 6pm. My daughter is enjoying the excellent WiFi coverage here and she also likes having restaurants on site, so that we don't have to head off walking in search of dinner. There is a kids' club here and sports available for a small fee such as paddling, tennis and an introduction to scuba diving. There is table tennis also and of course the spa and treatments. What we love best about this resort are the pools- the sea water pool for me and the heated outdoor pool for my daughter, where inflatables are permitted at this time of year. Oh, and the lovely lady at the hotel shop reserved a copy of my favourite Irish Sunday paper. We are having a brilliant time- thank you to João and your team. We give you six stars!"
May 2018,50,Miss,"We had an excellent stay at the hotel.Our Room was exceptionally clean&comfortable, food was delicious&staff were so friendly and helpful.We loved the pool facilities& the free shuttle to Albuferia town.Lovely beach &surroundings also."
May 2018,40,4*,"Staff, room views excellent. (Missing coffee making facilities for a 5*). Food variety should be improved as a whole and should cater for vegetarians. We paid full board which was a waste of money due to the vareity of food. Same menu whole time we stayed was a disappointment. At least water should ba provided without charge when we paid full board. Though the restaraunt staff were very kind helpful and polite."
May 2018,50,"Great Hotel, just on top of the beach","- Great apartments, all you need is included- Private parking in case you are driving- Beach just 10-15mins walk from the average apartment- Village very near, walking distance to restaurants and super markets"
May 2018,50,Fantastic hotel,This hotel was great both location and friendliness. The staff could not of been nicer it was a birthday while here and when we arrived back at the room the hotel had left a birthday greeting and wine.
May 2018,50,"Room was great, Service was awesome!","We stayed three nights at this hotel.  We loved it.  We had a view over the pool/ocean.  The service was awesome.  They were so helpful as we had never been to Portugal before.  The food in the restaurants was excellent and the view at the restaurant closest to the beach was terrific.  My wife is so picky about where we stay but she was very happy with this one.  We bought the romantic package which included a dinner, couples massage and Champagne and chocolate truffles delivered to the room.  What a deal that was.  I would not hesitate to stay there again."
May 2018,50,Loved it,"We returned following a not so great first experience, we had high hopes! We arrived, were greeted warmly, allocated a sea view room on the 3rd floor- amazing view! Shortly after arrival we were treated to champagne and truffles- an amazing treat! The resort is open and spacious, we ate at the pergola burger bar- beautiful food and service on the first night- very tasty, breakfast was ok, the dining room is big and on warm days you can dine on the terrace, there is a great choice but on every occasion the hot food was tepid when you got back to the table, the fresh orange juice and prepared fresh fruit was lovely. It does get busy and you can end up queing if you head down around 10.We ate at the Santa Eulalia restaurant at the front overlooking the beach - wow! The service was fantastic, my husband chose the tiger prawns, myself the piri piri chicken- they were cooked on the bbq by the chef and presented beautifully! They tasted amazing- highly recommended! My only grumble would be we were not told the price of the prawns before billed so it was a bit if a shock but overall we were very happy with the evening really worth the treat!The rooms are big, you have to request a kettle & take own tea/coffee, they give u 1 bottle of water on arrival, there is a fridge in the room which will filled with our drinks as the mini bar optional.We didn't use the pool area prefering the beach but it looked well served and was popular.We had an early check out and mentioned this when settling the bill, we were offered coffee to be brought to the room at a time to suit- 4am coffee/ juice/ breads/ ham and cheese  arrived! Perfect! We took sandwiches and fruit for the plane and enjoyed the fresh brew. Overall I would recommend this resort, it has a kids club, lots if activities if you wanted to join in. We found all the staff pleasent and accommodating, I loved the 'turn down' service - what a fab idea to put a sheet next to bed to stop sand ending up in your bed! Hopefully we will be back with friends soon!"
May 2018,50,Relaxing few days,"Picked this Hotel for a 4 day break and glad i did, very nice hotel and staff were excellent.Was my birth day during the trip and this was acknowledged with a cake and bottle of bubbly which was a very nice touch. The only minor gripe was the lack of tea/coffee in the room, perhaps this is standard in many hotels these days but would and possibly will go back."
May 2018,50,"Lovely,relaxing break.","Beautiful hotel, comfortable rooms, and wonderful food.Location perfect next to beach.The bus service from the door is also good.Spa wonderful to wind down and relax.Only negative is balcony furniture is in need of replacing"
May 2018,40,"Great location, friendly personnel, nice rooms","Very nice resort with wonderful beach. Despite of many hotel rooms, never felt crowded. Very good food in various restaurants. Spa expensive, but good. Convenient shuttle service to shopping locations as well as old town."
May 2018,40,Great location + very clean,Great location ...right beside the beach and very clean..reception staff + spa therapists excellent ...however very disappointed that 3 of the hydrotherapy jets + the Turkish bath were not working on both days I was there..+ no discount or allowance offered. Also we  stayed in self catering apartment that had a very loud electical unit just outside the patio door that kept my daughter awake at night + was annoying during the day...
May 2018,40,Lovely holiday,"Truly a dream holiday my only complaint would be shame the Spa was not fully working and the steam room would work one day and not the next,Appartment was lovely however the extra visitors(ants) were not welcome but overall I would recommend this beautiful hotel.We did ask for a swimming pool view but never got it the really nice young man on reception did say I think you can see it out of your window but this was not the case!"
May 2018,40,VladPetrovich,"Absolute great location on the ocean beach. Big free parking for those who come with the car as was my case! Good spacious room and bathroom. Dinner buffet is not attractive ,the food was dead ,was befor in the fridge. But a la carte restaurants are very good with the nice menu. Recommend this hotel."
May 2018,40,Very good value in low season,"+ Good service, beautiful location, huge appartement, extended breakfast buffet. Nipping at your coffee overlooking the ocean from the Antlantico Bar is superb. Good pricing in low season. - Noisy rooms and hard beds. Kids club activities were very disappointing. Staff is very friendly but did not manage to cross the language-barriers. My daughter came back crying while she is usually very happy at kids clubs. I believe they can make much more out of it."
May 2018,50,OUT OF THIS WORLD,Just returned home from this resort and from start to finish it was a fantastic experience  we are already planning a return visit in September.  If what you are looking for is a lovely hotel on a beach with fablous beach restaurants this is the place for you.  The hotel is situated on the beautiful Santa Eulaia beach with 3 lovely beach restaurants 5 mins from your doorstep.We got upgraded to a beautiful suite overlooking the pool and the beach it was just super ...It was a special birthday for my husband and we got wine champagne and cake all delivered to the room on the day of his birthday .Fantastic king size beds and beautiful crisp bed linen.Breakfast was everything you could wish for . though Id say in high season there would be enormous queues and the only down side is you have to queue for the coffee machine  in a 5 star hotel there should be people there to serve you coffee that is the only gripe i would have  I could not recommend this hotel highly enough
May 2018,50,"Excellent Resort, Returning July '18","Stayed here in Sep '17 and the place is unbelievably amazing in every way. Rooms are spacious and well stocked with everything you could need, facilities are perfect, staff were always friendly and helpful and the location could not be better.We are re-visiting in July '18 and the reception has even confirmed that we can stay in the same room again!"
May 2018,50,November holiday,Went as a couple for a week break and had a lovely time weather was excellent you get a bus out and into the town it was so easy and loved the hotel we had an apartment it was excellent clean every day
May 2018,20,Our 3rd visit (disappointed),"We have loved this hotel in the past, Unfortunately it has become a little tired and I think the staff have too,Other than breakfast staff who were lovely nobody else seams to give a damm, The pool staff are grumpyThe reception staff are grumpy The spa staff are totally unapprchable We kept our pool towels for 4days as not used much& when we tried to exchange we were refused, The hair dryer in the bathroom kept cutting out so housekeeping brought me another one which had no nossle,It's a crying shame that this hotel didn't meet our usual expectations ,"
May 2018,50,Late April stay,Such a beautiful hotel and lovely atmosphere. Our room was very spacious with a balcony. So clean and very welcoming reception. Perfect location with a complementary shuttle to new and old town regularly.
Apr 2018,50,Our holiday,"Lovely hotel very comfortable large bed and pillows, very clean , friendly staff , great location not far from all the bars and restaurants, then back for piece and quiet and a great nights sleep would definitely stay again"
Apr 2018,30,Good Location,"Hotel location very good, you will need a car to enjoy the area. lack of visibility of management. Staff where not very welcoming or helpfull. Hotel staff could do with a lesson in smilingClenliness was not up to standard you would expect. Indoor pool charged at 18 euro per visitcooked Breakfast was poor, bacon and sausages where very poor. Main pool not heated and very cold. pool area needed a cleaner in the mornings. On the plus side plenty of sunbeds and fantastic bay.Would need to see improvements before re booking this hotel"
Apr 2018,40,good location for the beach,"good location, good quality and choice of food, expect queues for breakfast at busy times during school holidays. mini bar items had to ordered, no coffee/tea making facilities in the room, good wi fi service in the room, service and help from management and house keeping were very good. have to be reasonably fit to go down to the beach and back up. Swimming pools may be good size for kids but not for length swimming. Will go back as management agreed to address certain issues. Used the spa and it is good value for money €18 but recommended attention to detail."
Apr 2018,10,Disappointed :(,This resort is definitely not 5 *.  A big disappointment to a perfect vacation so far!! The first room 002 they gave us was really the pits. Infested with ants & a terrible musty odor. After talking to the reception they moved us to 308. Here the air conditioning didn’t work. Several other guests had a similar problem . It appears they are trying to save on their power bills & will turn it on only if a guest complains. The phone didn’t work too. The maintenance man who attended was so callous. His comment was ....“at least the television works”. There is no coffee maker or an iron. No complimentary water.  Think twice before you fall for its 5* status. Will not recommend if one is looking for 5* comfort.
Apr 2018,50,Recomended hotel,"This is our 5th stay. Need I say more. It's comfortable, food is excellent. Beach right on your doorstep. Atlantico is great for a coffee or a bite during the day. Swimming pools are just right, but we tend to go in April so the main pool is cold."
Apr 2018,40,Good but requires improvement,"Nice hotel especially if you are staying in bungalows, not rooms. Reception handles everything quickly and efficiently. Staff in restaurant are even too quick to clean plates ;) but breakfast is not that special and ordering omelette or eggs can take a while. Hotel should consider having 2 persons preparing it. Healthy options are minimal. Come on! Where is your local yoghurt? I don’t want Danone! Also there should be choice of nuts, honey and prunes in the morning. Scrambled egg is tasteless. Great choice of pastry and bread. Ham and cold meat cheap quality. Supper is much better and variety of food really good including miniature puddings and sweats. Entertainment not every day and kids club run indoors, it’s a shame as if it doesn’t rain I would prefer kids are outdoors on playground not locked in conference room!!! Swimming pools are heated but not that warm. But overall resort is good just needs a bit of improvement. Don’t know how queues are handled in peak season as you have to wait for the table sometimes for breakfast/supper."
Apr 2018,40,"5 star,,, not really","Stayed full board, would expect water to be provided free during meals,, but NO.. had to pay extra..the spa did not have sauna and steam rooms working, eventually suana turned on,, steam room still not working ,, some parts of the spa  water jets was not working,,3 sections seemed to be non operational.."
Apr 2018,40,As good as it was before!,"After two years away we went back last week for a 7-day break with the kids. I have two children 11 and 5. We stayed in a one bedroom apartment which was more than big enough. The double bed is huge, its a 4 man bed! and there is a sofabed that comfortably sleeps two. Now, it was belting of rain, it rained 4 out of the 7 days we were there (brilliant ey!!) so it was a little frustrating.  Would go back again (not in April), hire a car though, cheap and the parking is free. I hired my car via Ryanair (cheapest by far) and it was painless. Eating in the hotel is eyewatering so you won't be scoffing bottles of Barolo either, the wine is very expensive. If you're self catering you won't be eating in the hotel. A trip to the old town is 7 euros but to be honest I think it's tacky, no charm and kitted out for the lads and lassies. That said there are a few hidden gems but avoid the square. We ended up eating in a restaurant called Ocatraio - a real find."
Apr 2018,40,Family beach hotel Albufeira,"Here 's a good and honest 5 star hotel with good rooms good sun exposition pools and Sta Eulalia beach near Albufeira It's not a complete secluded domain altough it's in a good park , good parking space And the premises are very good with enough room for families and couples Good portuguese and international food and a superb breakfast The Real hotel chain is a valuable and trustful experience"
Apr 2018,50,Stayed in the hotel much better,"Writing a review again after now staying in the hotel twice not apartments and have enjoyed my visits a lotThe beach is fab and the cafe on the beach is my favourite place It’s a safe resort and beautiful Only one or two things that could improve,  the quality of the loo paper but if you’re fussy take your own"
Apr 2018,50,Very impressive hotel and service,"We stayed for 6 nights and fell in love with the resort. Beautiful kept grounds, direct access to beach, immaculate pools and a neat little gym and spa area. Staff were friendly and provided exceptional service. Breakfast was a treat every morning - as we were in quiet season we never had to queue. We were upgraded to a sea view room, and were able to arrange a late check out. My only feedback would be to suggest tea and coffee making facilities be added to rooms - I missed a cuppa in the evening. We would highly recommend the resort to singles, couples or families. Thank you for a wonderful stay - we will be back."
Apr 2018,50,Nigel,"We had stayed here as a family short break. We are really happy with the staffs as they are polite, professional and friendly. The hotel facilities are exactly what described on the hotel website. It is very good value for money."
Apr 2018,50,Just Perfect!,"We stayed at this hotel to celebrate my birthday and our anniversary. Going away without our children is a rare treat for us, so we had spent a lot of time planning the perfect holiday. We had previously stayed in the Grand Real Italia hotel in Cascais and had had an amazing time, with top notch treatment. So we again opted to go for the Grand Real chain. I can genuinely say we were not disappointed! We emailed the hotel in advance to say that we were celebrating my birthday and anniversary. When we arrived we were not initially placed in the sea view room we had asked to be upgraded to (because the hotel was full), but thanks to a wonderful staff member called Rita and Ines the Real Experience Manager, a few strings were pulled and the following day we were moved to the most beautiful room I have ever experienced. The sea view was breathtaking and I spent many hours on the balcony just watching the waves splashing onto the shore and the people strolling on the beach. We were treated like royalty from that moment on. Cake and wine arrived in our room the following day with a message wishing us happy anniversary. Throughout our stay the staff were amazing and saw to our every need. There is a bus the hotel put on that takes you to both the new and old town, the old town being the most interesting part of albufeira with many restaurants to wet your appetite, bars, shops and a beautiful beach.The breakfast served by the hotel is the best (I recommend going as early as 07:30 - 8:30 to avoid the queue) including the dinner if you were to book the half-board option. Lunch at the hotel is served as a la carte and can be expensive. If that is not a good choice, then there are several restaurants outside the hotel, including restaurant O Pescado by the hotel beach and another one within the hotel itself, which is also a fantastic choice.The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly and I highly rate their customer service, especially when it comes to going beyond and above in meeting customer needs, which was the case in our situation. I would definitely plan another visit in the future with the children because the facilities are there for them to be catered for. Above all else, I would highly recommend this hotel because of it's grand size, excellent beach location and real experience."
Apr 2018,50,Brilliant,"MY husband and u have just stayed here for three nights, I have to say it was the finest hotel we have ever stayed in. Just hone and planning our return already the staff very freindly great English also on reception. non of my request were a ptoblem. Free shuttle bus outside the door into old town or new town. Looking forward to going back"
Apr 2018,50,Lovely hotel and welcoming staff.,"We arrived before our room was ready and the member of reception staff told us where we could eat lunch in the hotel while we were waiting and that they would put our bags in their locked room. I didn't have to suggest anything as the member of staff asked us to check back in an hour after contacting the cleaning team to see if we could have our room. I was given an information leaflet about all the weeks activities for children and adults alike which also gave the times of the restaurants opening times and the times of the free bus in to Albufeira.We had a superb lunch in the Real Cozinha Restaurant. This is also where you have breakfast and the buffet dinner. When we got in our room we were delighted with it, a sea view as requested, very clean and spacious enough for the 3 of us. The pool area was kept clean and thankfully for the kids the heated pool was warm as the unheated one was very cold! It was April after all. We didn't use the Spa as my kids were under the age limit. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Always greeted you with a smile.Fantastic location on a gorgeous beach, I recommend walking to/from Olhos De Agua along the beach at low tide. Just beautiful. We took advantage of the shuttle bus to Albufeira Old Town one day. Very easy drop off and pick up at the top of the escalator or at the strip if you wanted. Highly recommend this hotel.  We had a very relaxing stay in a quiet room"
Apr 2018,50,Excellent family stay,"We stayed at the Grande Real with our 6 year old daughter and all loved it. The staff were all so friendly, whether it be at reception, in the restaurant or the cleaners. From check in we were given a ride to our apartment in a golf buggy. It wasn't really necessary given we were only just across the car park but our daughter thought it was great fun.We had a 2 bedroom apartment which had everything we needed and was clean and well decorated and furnished. There were 2 bathrooms, a smaller one with a shower and larger one which also had a bath and shower. Beds were comfortable, our double bed was massive. There were tv's in both bedrooms which the 6 year old found a great novelty, they offer a range of English language channels including CBeebies and Cartoon Network for kids.Breakfast was a buffet with loads of choice; cooked items, pastries, cereals, porridge, pancakes and much more. A number of other reviews have commented on the queue to get in to the restaurant for breakfast, we ate before 9am each morning and there were always plenty of tables available but we did see queues between 9:30 and 10:30. The 6 year old did loudly comment that the queuing people were lazy and should have got out of bed earlier!We also had our evening meal at the hotel. Again this was a buffet with the choices changing each night. The food was very European and with plenty of seafood but if you want chips you're out of luck as there weren't any. This didn't bother us and even our fussy 6 year old found enough to her liking and even tried a few things she wouldn't normally touch at home. There were plenty of desserts though so that was always her favourite part of the meal.The hotel location on the beach is excellent with great views and although a little way out from the old town there is a free shuttle bus provided by the hotel through the day to the old town and strip. There are quite a few pools, none of the outdoor pools are heated and as it was early April they felt freezing, not that it out the 6 year old off. I imagine that in warmer weather they feel refreshing. If we return to Albufeira we'd definitely go back to the Grande Real."
Apr 2018,50,Lovely property. Great for families.,A gorgeous resort with a friendly top notch staff. The kids club was fantastic and we had an amazing and relaxing holiday. An absolutely perfect location overlooking a breathtaking beach. Would love to come back.
Apr 2018,50,Fantastic stay.,"Came here for a 5 night stay with a friend. The resort is beautiful. It has 3 indoor pools (1 is heated) plenty of space to get a deckchair outside. The beach is literally on your doorstep and then views are insane! We also had breakfast which was great & included everything you could want. The staff at this hotel go out of their way to help you & are so friendly so huge thumbs up. Especially to the lady on reception who was a “trainee”! The hotel is really close to both old and new town so great for day out, dinners or even for the bars/clubs. Only downside was the indoor spa centre. We paid to use the sauna, steam room and the therapeutic pool. Did not see value for money. Other than that we had a brilliant time!"
Apr 2018,30,Don’t be fooled...Not 5*,"Firstly, I’d like to say I and my family had a lovely holiday. But this hotel isn’t a 5* Hotel so if you go expecting that you will be disappointed, which is what I was. I believed it’s trip advisor star rating :-(The good points : •staff were friendly and helpful. On are arrival room was hot and stuffy, air condition didn’t seem to work. We rang reception and they sent someone up. Obviously it had be disabled to save money, so he had to do something in the ceiling area to turn it back on. Could not have slept if that hadn’t been addressed so pleased they sorted it.•Reception area clean, grand and impressive •Pool areas/garden lovely (not obviously in April the outdoor pool was freezing, having one of the hotels 7 outdoor pools heated might have been nice?) •bed turn down service nice, but necessary? Is that why they get 5*?The not so good:•queuing, yes queues to get into breakfast. Regularly going for breakfast at 9:30-9:40 (open till 10:30) we had to wait to be seated. On two occasions we saw people waiting at 10:30 to get into restaurant.•the very outdated bathroom, bath with over head hand held tap controlled shower.•being charged 4.50€ for a bottle of water for the room. Yes 5* and only got 1 bottle of complementary water on 10day holiday. Oh and no coffee making facility in room.•the unsafe looking, shabby put up bed for child in room. • stained chairs in room.•and well if go expecting a good kids club as you’d get with first choice, don’t. They tried, but our child went for 2hrs only coz she wanted to bounce on the bouncy castle and go on the Easter egg hunt. Don’t expect 5* and you’ll be fine."
Apr 2018,50,Lyla + Sean Ireland,Excellent resort for families and older couples.  Could not find any fault with this resort.  Staff in all departments very helpful and friendly.  Rooms cleaned daily with extra fresh towels etc.  Breakfast a real treat - looking forward to next visit.
Apr 2018,50,Wonderful Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff were so welcoming, our room was spacious, clean and we could see the sea from our balcony (without requesting). The views from the hotel are phenomenal, we really did not want to come home. We ate at three of the four restaurants and all were lovely. If I had any slight disappointment it would be the charge to use the indoor pool (we did not know this) and we would have liked tea and coffee in our room (considering it’s a five star). I would happily come again, the location is perfect and I’m already missing it. Thank you xx"
Apr 2018,40,5 star hotel with 4 star management,"The review pertains to our April 2018 stay at Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa. The hotel is placed in a fabulous location - on a cliff overseeing a gorgeous private beach. It has the amenities of a 5 star resort, however not a 4 star management of these facilities. An example is the restaurant where breakfast is served. The restaurant is way too small for the number of people it caters to and each morning people of all ages have to queue for 10-20mins outside the restaurant until a table become available (ridiculous!). The hotel does have the space to extend the breakfast area but for some reason (I feel is lack of interest on the management side) they keep things as they are. I raised the point with the restaurant manager and I was told ""you can take your options to the reception"" as it was none of his business or interest. It's really sad to see potential in this property but lack interest in developing this potential."
Apr 2018,40,Good Hotel and location,The stay in the hotel was very nice and very good location with access to the beach. The staff's were very  kind and  helpful. Our 1 bed room was spacious and clean. Free shuttle to the old town was really useful.
Apr 2018,40,Not a five star ,"This hotel needs a star review5* I would say 4*Few things you have to pay separately for the in door pool. 18 Euros which is a jokeIn a five star, it should be standard. There is a fish restaurant on the beachPlease don't waste your money, it's low key food with high prices and poor food."
Apr 2018,50,"Excellent hotel, lovely views, very good service","We enjoyed a few days at this hotel, it deserves the 5 star ranking, however the whole atmosphere is laid back. There is very little to say that is not positive. The hotel has an excellent beach, with easy access. All of the hotel staff were friendly, and efficient. The inclusive breakfast was also great, with many food options. The hotel management definitely go the extra mile for their guests. The hotel price was very competitive, despite being head and shoulders above the rest."
Apr 2018,40,Good hotel but not a 5 star ,"This is a lovely hotel with great service and amazing location. Probably one of the best in the proximity. There are , however a few points that can help to improve We had a double room overlooking the sea , the views were lovely and it was very nice and quite The extra bed provided for our daughter had a vey thin mattress , could not use itThe breakfast selection is lovely, nice fruits and pastries but had to purposefully ask for fresh omelette /eggs to be made ( not advertised) . All coffees are only from the machine. The most disappointing thing was that the indoor spa / pool is for adults only and costs 20 eur per day/visit. For a 5 star family hotel I would definitely expect an indoor pool with access for children Thank you"
Apr 2018,40,A grand fatther review,The sweet  swimming pool was really cold the first day. Other services are very good. No information about nearby touristic attactions. My little children enjoyed the breakfast a lot. The price for the dinner is too high for the quality of the food.
Apr 2018,50,Above and beyond ,"We visited as a family, the hotel was very quiet even though it was Easter. We were very lucky with the weather and even on the really warm days you could always get a sunbed. Drinks are over priced but it is a 5star hotel. Didn't eat at the hotel. Room cleaned every day and very spacious. On our last day, our daughter got a big splinter in her foot from the decking around the pool (be careful) we went to reception to ask for something to get it out. The manager and a security man promptly,  came to the room and assisted us. On our return to the room later in the evening, we were shocked to see a delivery of Wine, fruit and chocolate brownies as a way of an apology. This service was above and beyond what we expected."
Apr 2018,40,Perfect location,"I like more comfort in the lounge, the music was hard diner buffet was nog so goed for the privé you had to pay.. the swimmingpool and the bus around it was perfect. The rooms are everyday cleand and the people are very kindly."
Apr 2018,50,"Beautiful location, excellent service","Great location with plenty to do on site, free bus to town and lots within walking distance of the resort. Rooms were clean and spacious, excellent service at all times and plenty of food choice available."
Apr 2018,50,Great hotel,"We had a beautiful room on the 3rd floor, great sea view and a large balcony . The reception staff were very efficient and very nice. The hotel it’s self has everything you need to have a great holiday. We will definitely be back."
Apr 2018,40,Easter Holiday Apr 2018,"We have been going to this hotel with our daughter who is now 10 years old for seven years.  We always book a sea view suite on B&B basis.  This year however we were slightly disappointed.  The rooms now had wooden flooring which creaked continuously all day and all night and for the first time since we have been going there our daughter was up every night with the noise.   Little things have changed and although not major these were the things that have drawn us back year after year.  No pots of coffee in the morning anymore, it's out of a machine now (not the same unfortunately).  We usually always have a pot of coffee to the room first thing before breakfast.  This again was initially just two cups of machine coffee which we eventually managed to change to a pot with a pot of milk, however the size varied when we did have it some days a pot with no more than two cups in it and other days with a larger pot but all priced the same.  The staff have always been really friendly and helpful, seeing the same staff year after year which must be a good sign.  However quite a lot of new faces (which obviously happens) but some not particularly friendly or helpful.   No one to meet us to take bags when we arrived which is the first time this has happened.  I guess these are all pretty minor things but just not the service we have received every other time.  shame really as it tarnished our visit a wee bit, we always feels very at home and a huge wave of peace and tranquility when we arrive there.  Maybe time to look elsewhere, though I'm sure we'll end up back there at some point.....I hope"
Apr 2018,40,PROS and CONS,"A great hotel,but a little pricey.Plenty of sunbeds and 3 pools.Bus from hotel to town a bonus.Restaurants in hotel expensive.Better to go to Martins, left at main road outside hotel, a short walk.Better still a 4 euro taxi ride or 20 mins.walk to Adego do Ze.Turnright outside hotel.The local Portuguese frequent it.It is VERY reasonable.Enjoy!"
Apr 2018,50,Easter break,First time to Portugal with family. Wonderful place to stay and very close to sandy beach. Excellent rooms and big enough for a family of 4. Good room service and friendly front desk staffs. Will definitely recommend and visit again.
Apr 2018,50,Magical!,"If you can ignore the crime against design and architecture (think 90s Changing Rooms style) this is a magical hotel, on a gorgeous cove with spectacular views of the cliffs, private beach and sea. Service and staff are great. The room is large and clean, would benefit from having drinks in the mini bar and tea/coffee facilities. Breakfast buffet is really good. Lunch and dinner in same restaurant. There is also a gourmet burger restaurant. The fish restaurant is outstanding quality, well worth a visit. There are two swimming pools, outdoor bars, tennis courts, and a spa and gym. It appears to be popular with families. There is also a fish restaurant and bar in the beach. We are only here for a couple of days, but would happily spend a two week holiday here relaxing in comfort. We wouldn’t need to leave the hotel!"
Apr 2018,50,Wonderful hotel and staff,"We are just home yesterday from this hotel. It was our 2 nd visit and we’ve booked today to go again in June. The seaview rooms are brilliant and hotel so close to the beach you can hear the waves washing onto the sand.The staff could not be more pleasant and friendly,especially all staff at reception. Can’t wait for June"
Apr 2018,50,Superb staff.,Excellent hotel. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Food was excellent (stayed on half board.) Location was great. Walks down and along beach after breakfast pleasant.. Cleaning of rooms daily. Will definitely return.
Apr 2018,30,Let down but still ok,"Arrived at hotel, looking amazing walking into reception service was great staff pleasant, we found our room, all looking fine. Our balcony opens up to the front where coach's pull up so couldn't leave the door open to let fresh air in the room, the air conditioning unit didn't work in our room, handles broken off in the bathroom, the bedroom was cleaned everyday, the spa pool and sauna is €18 each to use, pools outside  are very very small. The bar next to the pool charges €9 tuna sandwich have deep pockets for this hotel if you want to enjoy it, and to eat in for dinner your looking at €30 each without drinks!! The location of this place is close to beach which has lovely soft sand. (Bring your own shade) location to shops is 15min walk or 2 min taxi €5 ride. New town reminds you of Blackpool and tourist shops and British bars, I'd say this hotel is a british 3 star with 4 star service."
Apr 2018,50,Best Hotel in Algarve!!!!,"I absolutely love this hotel, My husband and myself are coming here for number of years and every year it is amazing!!! Look forward going back every year!!!! This hotel I would recommend to anyone it’s the best hotel and has excellent management staff & facilities 💕💕"
Apr 2018,50,First Class!,"My Fiancee and I recently came to stay at your beautiful Resort as we are getting married here in October 28th 2018. We very much enjoyed our short stay and cannot wait to return in October! All the services, amenities, location, staff were very nice indeed and could not do enough for us during our stay. This recent stay has really have put our mind at ease as a fantastic choice for our wedding venue for ourselves our  friends, and family and truly cannot wait until our return in October. We really wait until our return in October. A big thank-you to Angela the manager who showed us around your beautiful resort  also.  Best wishes Dermot & Zarah!"
Apr 2018,50,Fortieth wedding anniversary,I have booking with you from 30th April to 4th May. Could we request room with view for fortieth wedding anniversary. Friends of ours stayed before and told us of your work nderful hotel. Looking forward to staying. Tried to message you via your website but unable to.Thanks Sheryl Phillips
Apr 2018,50,Wonderful family situation.,"The studio accommodation, with view over the soccer field and swimming pool, suited our family very well. The boys loved the bouncy house- kids club and meeting with other children. The beach and swimming pools were pristine. The whole environment was beautiful and elegant."
Apr 2018,50,Superb,"First time visiting and have to say we were blown away by the stunning vistas ,the hotel ,the hotel team ( every member of staff we encountered) the T2 apartment was perfect and we will be back. Five star but very family focussed."
Apr 2018,50,Easter Break,"Hotel has everything needed for a nice family break. Clean rooms, lovely pool and beach, great kids club, bus service to old town. Reception staff very helpful with luggage delivered to the apartment on arrival. The bar drinks can be expensive, but other than that, it was an amazing stay overall and we will be back."
Apr 2018,50,"Fab hotel, great staff","Just spent 7 days at this hotel and was really impressed with facilities, accommodation and service. Despite the relatively bad weather (rain and cold wind) it didn't spoil the holiday.  We had a few sunny days which improved as the week went on.  The hotel has a lovely spa and gym to pass away the time although the thalasso spa/indoor pool comes at a charge of €20 for 1.5hrs which I thought was a bit excessive as I was looking forward to using the indoor pool for a daily swim as the outdoor pools, whilst fantastic, are not quite as enticing when it is raining and cold. To start with let me tell you about our arrival at the hotel.  The check in at reception was very quick, around 10mins, the staff being more than pleasant and helpful.  A porter was waiting with our luggage to take us to the apartment via golf type buggy. On arrival he took our luggage inside and checked we had everything we needed.  I requested an iron and ironing board which was delivered within 15 minutes (at no extra charge, unlike some other hotels in the area.) The apartment contained everything needed for a self catering holiday, pots, pans, full dinner service, coffee machine kettle fridge, microwave, cooking rings etc, etc. We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis so didn't really take full advantage of the facilities.  The room was cleaned daily and towels, toiletries etc replenished or replaced as needed.  The bed was fantastic and both myself and my husband remarked on how comfortable it was, never stayed in a hotel that provided such a comfortable bed and pillows.  Towelling robes are also provided, although these were a little dated, they were very clean, as was the apartment.  We had a television in both the lounge and the bedroom and access to all english channels, a bonus if you have children with you and the weather is poor.Now for the food.  Breakfast was very good and something for everyone, however the hot food was the same every day, no variation but with the array of other foods on offer this wasn't a problem.  The champagne at breakfast was very welcome and many diners took advantage.  Only someone very picky would find fault with the food.  The hotel itself is very nice and has a great pool area.  There are also other pools set amongst the apartments so even in high season I would expect there to be plenty of space to sunbathe. The greatest bonus of all is that the hotel sits right on a beautiful beach and there is a very good cafe on the terrace above the beach.  As it was still out of season some facilities were not available but we will certainly return when the weather is warmer to take full advantage of the location and facilities.An added bonus is that the hotel runs a regular shuttle service to both the 'Strip' (new town) and Albufeira old town, this is via their own coach (not a minibus) so there is plenty of space for guests.To conclude I would say this is the best hotel we have stayed at in Portugal, the people are lovely so if you have never been give it a go. We will certainly return to the Grand Real Santa Eulalia."
Apr 2018,50,60th birthday celebration ,"Portugal beautiful people, beautiful scenery, fresh food, friendly people, went out of season if this is your cup of tea....empty beach attached to the resort .....excellent, we stayed in the two apartment equipped with every thing you would need to cook a decent meal"
Apr 2018,50,Pre Easter Break,"My wife and returned to Grande Real this year because we had such a lovely time last year. Once again we had a lovely time, with all that we enjoyed the previous year still in place. We have no real negatives again. The one thing we did notice though was the noise in the restaurant, which was uncomfortable. Now this may be because the previous year the weather was better, therefore more people ate outside, or maybe  there were many more people in the hotel this year, than last."
Mar 2018,40,Nice Apartments,"This is a very upscale resort.  We stayed for a month.  Did not use the restaurants as they were much more expense than the restaurants just outside the resort.  The service was good, the room clean.  Wifi was good.  Beds smelled of mildew.  You would think that a 5 star resort would have clean beds.  Felt pads under the chair legs would have stopped the noise of scraping chairs from surrounding units, which was annoying.  Staff was great:  front desk, instructors, etc."
Mar 2018,30,Good but not 5*,"We stayed here for 7 nights, accommodation is nice, location is beautiful and the hotels appearance is clean and good but the service is not 5*, the food choice is minimal - there was no child options other than pasta. House cleaning left our room door wide open all day after cleaning it and we constantly had to keep asking for information that should have been visible for guests."
Mar 2018,30,Grande Real Santa Eulalia,The resort was good. The only problem we had was that room was NOT a 5 star bedroom. Its a bit dated. Service from staff was good and reception was very good helping to solve some problems with paying highway tolls
Mar 2018,30,Mixed experience,"Can't fault this hotel for cleanliness and comfort in room. For a 5 star hotel there were minor irritations, like the request for a kettle in the room resulted in  towels being delivered, although small coffee sized cups were given to us in the bar, they would not let us  have the larger cups even though they were available there, our room cards failed to open the gate to the beach the second time we used it and the next day they would not let us access our room and needed resetting again. The main restaurant where breakfast and a buffet evening meal are served was overcrowded and very noisy although later in the season there are tables available outside, it was too cold for us to do this. The chairs in this restaurant need replacing or repainting. The breakfast was very good, the buffet evening meal awful. We used room service after that for our evening meal as the hotel is a bit too far to walk into town. The room service meals were very good and we found enough choice for the  3 meals we needed.The adult pool was very cold which was very disappointing, the children's pool was warmer though and plenty of children were using it, unlike the adult pool. Some people have moaned about the number of steps to the beach, we found 3 routes down with between 60 and 69 steps but with stretches of flat between so not a reason to be put off unless you have serious health problems"
Mar 2018,50,BERNIE & JIMMY ENJOYED THEIR STAY AT THE GRANDE REAL SANTA EULALIA RESORT & HOTEL SPA,"Excellent.  We will definitely be back.  We were staying in self catering accommodation, but used the hotel food facilities on a regular basis.  The location and ambience is one of the best we have experienced to date, especially the private entrance onto the  very secluded beach."
Mar 2018,40,2 week stay,My wife and I have found this resort to be very comfortable and relaxing. It’s a very large resort with many different types of rentals. We are on a long stay trip so will be here for two weeks. The grounds are very nice and the kitchenettes are comfortable. Everyone eats in the dining room and the food and selection has been very good. This only draw back is you have to bring an entry coupon for dinner every night. This needs to be updated. All the staff have been very nice but room linens are changed once a week. I think that could be at least twice a week. We would highly recommend this resort!
Mar 2018,40,Lovely beach front hotel,I have always wanted to stay at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Hotel and on the whole it did not disappoint me although the weather could have been kinder as had two days of torrential rain!  Our room had a sea view which was amazing but we were on the first floor so maybe second or third floors would have an even better view.The staff were on the whole were very efficient and some very friendly especially the main bar staff.We were surprised on our day of arrival with some champagne and small pastries for our anniversary which was a very lovely thing for the hotel to have done for us and very much appreciated.The breakfast was excellent and there was a great choice of food and drinks and the waiting staff were very good at clearing the tables.  I only have two slight negatives.  The food in the main restaurant for dinner had not much in the way of variety and for me the desserts always saved my meal!  The dinners (and many other diners I spoke to said the same) were lukewarm so maybe the heating plates need to be looked at to keep the food hotter or install a microwave maybe? If you go self catering then that may be the better option.The other negative is the main bar doesn't feel like a bar!  You feel as if you are in a corridor and there is no atmosphere!  I guess this improves once the season is in full swing.If these slight negatives were addressed I would not hesitate in giving the hotel a score of 10 out of 10.  Cannot fault the setting of the hotel though and it looks amazing in the sunshine!  Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
Mar 2018,50,REal and GRande,PErfect locatiosn  PErfect service PErfect Beach Perfect food  PEtfect Stuff   all in all  REal Grande HOtel Beautiful complex with a lot of free parking places  Breakfast more than perfect highly recommnded
Mar 2018,50,Lovely Hotel,"Last minute booking of single bed apartment direct with central reservations. Internet site really easy to use. Accomodation and facilities within the apartment were excellent. Location just outside Albufiera but free hotel bus into town was great. Peaceful and relaxing break despite weather not being great. Hotel food limited and expensive but for self catering, supermarket only 10 mins away and everything could need in the kitchen, except an oven, made eating in very easy. Booking to return in 6 weeks when weather should be better"
Mar 2018,50,Never fails to please,Stayed again for the 2nd time in 3 weeks can't stay away from this hotel best position  than any around staff are excellant from the reception through to the cleaners and of cause the general manager can't do enough to please you make you feel like a friend coming back home just can't wait to come avain
Mar 2018,50,Amazing 5 star hotel,Great hotel right on the beach has everything you could possibly want self catering accommodation is brilliant hotel staff superb quiet comfortable rooms always friendly and helpful staff and spoke very good English.
Mar 2018,50,"Great stay, good price. will return","Just returned from Portugal and stayed for a week in the Grande Real Santa Eulália Resort & Hotel SPAFirst: We stayed in the hotel during early March.. the off season so hotel was not packed. Everything was as we expected when we arrived .. however it rained every day .But with this in mind the Hotel experience did not let us down one bit.The Service was top notch, all employees speaking english was a bonus , all our requested were promptly addressed. Second ; the pricing was great value for a 4 - 5 star hotel.. breakfast was very good even cooking me my favorite omlete every morning .. no surprise charges at all .Third : management sent a nice bottle of wine and fruit platter when we arrive to celebrate my wifes' 60th birthday .. nice touch.Forth : I read that the beds could be a bit hard so requested the mattress cover to soften them up a bit ,,, and bingo the beds were perfect.. TV had various channels in english , wifi was spot on .. and our room on the second floor JR suite.. overlooking the sea was very spacious and had a great veiw of the ocean. The large washroom and large tub was greatly appreciated.Finaly : I am sure the pool and grounds would have been just as spectacular if we had visited in warmer weather...The pictures on line show the hotel just the way it is .. no photo shopping that i could see ,,Overall I would be happy to revisit this hotel any time of year...steve / Canada"
Mar 2018,40,Scottish Dancing weekend,Just spent the weekend at the hotel for the annual Iberian Scottish dancing weekend.  All the staff in the main restaurant were friendly and were very helpful when I asked what the Gluten Free options were.  I was delighted with my apartment as it had great self catering facilities.
Mar 2018,30,Scottish Country Dance Iberian Weekend March 16 -18 2018,"We were a large Scottish Country Dance group. My room was 557 which was far away (350 metres)from the hotel and the rest of the group. The logistics for dinner in the main restaurant could not deal with over 100 people arriving at the same time. It took nearly 30 minutes to get each course. It inconvenienced the other residents who had to wait a long time to get a table. I had stomach problem after eating dinner one night. If you are having a large group to stay they should be accommodated together so that they can socialise and eat together at larger tables. (the tables were for 2 or 4 people) the Maitre d was very unwilling to make up a larger table, although this just meant a number of tables being pushed together. The enjoyment of the guests seemed to be a lot less important than the convenience of the staff. The arrangement of the food in the buffet was strange. The queue started at the desserts then cold food then hot food then more cold food then soup. It is my view that if a local Portuguese restaurant served the food we received, it would go out of business very soon."
Mar 2018,30,Not 5 star,"PROSgreat locationfantastic beach.great bus shuttle service to strip and old town.close to many good restaurants.helpful staff.quiet with good security.good gourmet hamburger cafe.nice beach cafe.CONS.apartments dated need upgrading.no help re working ac and heatingfan not working in bathroomno laundry facilities,very costly to use hotel service.apartment cleaning weekly not sufficientno dishcloths or sweeping brush in apartmentfree hotel sponsored bus tour cancelled because of weather forecast,it was sunniest day of week!!breakfast and dinner buffets overpriced, food not hot.would consider returning but not 5 star facility"
Mar 2018,50,Relaxing,"Haven’t a bad word to say about the hotel itself. It was my wife’s 50th birthday whist we were there and the hotel organised to be brought to our room, a cake with candle and a bottle of champagne. But I think the spa is a tad over priced. And doesn’t cater for those that aren’t confident in water."
Mar 2018,50,Excellent hotel,"Really enjoyed our week fabulous location on the beach, excellent facilities and very friendly helpful staff despite unseasonably cold weather.  The bedroom and bathroom was very spacious. Helped us book trips and advised where to go."
Mar 2018,50,Great experience ,"We have just finished a four week holiday here for 4th consecutive year. We love it. The apartment is clean,well stocked. All staff are professional,helpful,friendly. The entertainment in the evening is a real treat. The location is excellent for walking ,hiking . There are many restaurants close by...in addition to the ones located in hotel. Spa is excellent."
Mar 2018,50,Birthday,"I stay 4 night in this amazing hotel ,everythings was allright.the room with seevieuw was very nice and confortable.the top was  the day of my birthday ,i received from the direction a cake with candel  and a bottle of brut.It was really fantastic.Thank very much at all"
Mar 2018,50,This resort goes FAR beyond multiple amenities and incredible accommodations and staff,"We are staying here for the second time and are enjoying our 7 week annual holiday in an establishment that has the BEST of staff in all areas of this terrific hotel.  That includes management, reception, housekeeping, and all service staff.More so, when I became very ill shortly after our arrival and required an ambulance late one night (insulin shock), my travelling companion called reception and explained the seriousness of my condition.  Within minutes, a gentleman arrived with a medical  bag and stayed by my side until the ambulance arrived . Several bags of sucrose were administered and once my blood sugar went up above 4, I was taken to the emergency clinic and treated immediately by a crew of very competent nurses and a terrific doctor.  While most of the occurrences were  somewhat blurry, I knew that it was thanks to the staff at the Grande Real , the ambulance and the hospital that I came through this terrifying experience.  The next day, I received a beautiful basket of fruit and mineral water from a manager who promised to keep in touch to oversee my progress.  How does one thank these incredible individuals????Lastly, would you believe they sent a birthday card, a delicious cake and a bottle of ""vin mousseux"" for my friend's birthday.  I would NEVER consider any other hotel when I  am in the Algarve..  Thank you Grande Real!!!!"
Mar 2018,50,Another Visit to these lovely apartments,"Hi GuysMy wife and myself along with two friends booked into these apartments from 6th February 2018 for 10 days,all booked through jet2.once again jet 2 were great,we think the jet2 staff are just lovely,always helpful and with a nice smile.We booked private transfers with jet 2 again no problems,straight off the plane straight into a people carrier.We arrived at the reception and were booked into our apartments very quickly we had apartment 591 our friends were right next door.They take you to your apartment on a golf buggy saves you humping your cases around,,great touch we think.The apartments are very clean nice and fresh and bright,kettle,fridge,cups and everything you need,,wine glasses etc.We loved just sitting outside our apartments just chilling in the sun with some nice wine and snacks.It was out of season visit for us again so the place is very quiet,lovely grounds and pools but a bit chilly for a dip,the main hotel has a nice bar with entertainment some nights also a great beach bar for morning breakfast or lunch and drinks,just watching the sea.Great beach we enjoyed the walking along it.We walked into Albufeira most morning for breakfast at Rita's plaice,they do nice fish and chips as well hence the name.We also found nice quiet bar snooker just out the hotel gates turn right,cross road walk a bit its on the right side of the road we called it 1 Euro bar,cos wine was 1 Euro a glass.Also handy little supermarket out side hotel gates turn right,cross the road just passed gas tank,,we used the gas tank steps,bit of a short cut.Yes we all enjoyed our stay and will be heading back for maybe a longer stay,,miss our winter months.hope we have been helpful,,all the best the GeordiesOh be careful of Paradise tours not very good."
Mar 2018,50,Amazing stay during stormy weather,"We returned last week from Faro after a week stay at the resort. We went with our 2 year old and it was our first time in Portugal. The weather was not good due to storm emma and it rained a lot. The first apartment we were given had a faulty aircon, which meant we had to move to another one next morning. The second apartment (425) had the same issue with the aircon not heating the bedroom, but we had to manage as it was not an option to move again with our little one. The bedroom was getting really cold at night and did cause a bit of discomfort to our baby. The apartments were a little outdated, but they were clean. The cleaning lady who cleaned our apartment during the week was amazing. Whenever she saw something missing in the apartment, she would bring it over without us asking for me. Very sensible. The apartment was very nicely cleaned everyday and it helped us to make the most of the holiday rather than worrying about cleaning.The resort is just next to the beach and has amazing sea views. There are round 4 restaurants, not sure if they all belong to the resort, but all of them provide amazing sea views which we enjoyed during lunch. The food was average here.Staff at the hotel were very friendly, polite and more than happy to help. The resort is around 15mins away from the Albufeira old town. We did not try the food at the hotel so cannot comment. There is an Italian restaurant just outside the resort and they do takeaway. There two more restaurants which one can find via google. The closest supermarket is Favorite (around 15mins walk) or InterMarche which is around 25mins towards Albufeira old town. Zoomarine is around 20mins and taxi would cost around Eur 18. Another place we visited on our last day was KrazyWorld which is around 35mins from the hotel and the taxi came to around Eur 24.The resort has good wifi connection, which did help on occasions when the weather was not good. They also had Cbeebies tv channel which kept our little one entertained. There is also an indoor childern's play house. We visited it couple of times and it has quite a good selection of toys. One of the things which we did not like about the resort was the breakfast. While booking the resort, the price of the breakfast was given as Eur 15 with an option only to pay at hotel. While checking in we were offered Eur 12.50 only if we decide to choose it for the whole stay and if we did not decide there and then, the breakfast would be Eur 20 a day. So for a couple staying for 10 days would roughly spend Eur 400 only on breakfast, which sounds over the top. Not worth if one would only have a croissant and a coffee.Another thing we discovered is, the booking site said indoor pool, but there is none. The one which is present in the hotel is part of Spa and the charge is Eur 18 for 90mins usage. All the other pools are outdoors, but some of them are heated. All in all our stay at the resort was good. We would have enjoyed if the weather had been better, but cannot fault the resort for that. We will certainly choose the resort if we visit Portugal again."
Mar 2018,50,holiday,great hotel and would recommend it to everybody  very comfortable and the staff very friendly and helpful. everything that you need for a great holiday cant wait to return. all bars and restaurants have great services and  great  variety . also the spa area was lovely and  for travelers with young children the kids club would be a great rest bite for them. also the many swimming pools was great and the beach so close was great
Mar 2018,50,Excellent Portugal Experience!,"Overall, my first visit to Portugal was amazing. The Grand Real Santa Eulália is in a great location, close to town thanks to the hotel bus service & central to markets & cafés. The staff was attentive,  prompt & most accommodating. The units were quite adequate and comfortable. I would certainly recommend this hotel to friends & family."
Mar 2018,50,2018 Vacation,Had a very good time at this resort. Location was excellent as city buses and tour buses stopped outside the resort gate. Added value was the resort shuttle which ran several times daily to and from Albufeira. The resort fronts the beach for a great way to stretch your legs. Cappuccinos on the Atlantico terrace in the morning and gelatos  in the afternoon. Very good.
Mar 2018,50,Anne,"Beautiful hotel in lovely location, staff couldn’t be more helpful from reception to cleaners. The whole resort is well kept. Great variety of food to suit everyone. The courtesy bus is an added bonus."
Mar 2018,50,Amazing return stay,"We have stayed here three times previously and would not hesitate to return again. Everything and everyone at the resort are amazing. The staff and Resort really are 5 star. The rooms are clean and well presented. We had a sea view room and the outlook was great, it was sheltered and great to sit out on of an evening on the balcony. Breakfasts are truly good."
Mar 2018,20,"Family with young toddler,out of seasons point of view","SUMMARY:- Nice hotel with great views, but not very entertaining for kids (evening at least)and your money wont go very farThe hotel is in a fantastic location looking down on the beach! The beach bar is a great place to chill out! The hotel and rooms are very clean, with our rooms and towels changed daily if you wish! Our balcony came in very handy for entertaining our 16month old son!  The rooms do not have tea making facilities but can be bought for €3 In reception! They have a safe and a fridge The buffet breakfast has plenty to choose from although the fried breakfast is very disappointing! We arrived early for breakfast each day where we found the beans sometimes to be hard and cold, the fried eggs and hash browns were also cold!  On the third day,I gave up on the cooked and stuck to continental options! (Which were very nice)The staff in the hall are polite and collect plates as soon as they become empty! Hot drinks,juice and water are available free of chargeThe hotel has a kids play area(which are son loved), open most of the day accept 1-2! The staff here are happy smiley people who interact well with the kids! They preferred to tidy the toys up after we left rather than us sorting them as we went and were happy for us to borrow buckets and spades for the beach! There are plenty of toys and a tv with computer along with a good secure park! There are plenty of places to eat at the hotel but it is quality over quantity! We bought a milk shake, a beer and 2 burgers which cost €36!(tasty and looked good)We asked about the buffet option on a thundery evening, bearing in mind our cold breakfast,I wasn't prepared to chance paying €30 per person for the same in the evening! We chose to go out the rest of the time and get more for our money!(spoiled for choice in the 2 towns and strip)The gym has everything you need and is available all day,towels for during exercise and showers,along with lockers are available free of charge!  (Being an ex rugby player it didn't bother me,but neither of the individual shower cubicals are lockable in the men's room!)The hotels pools were dissapointing too, the outdoor pools are supposedly heated to 27° but felt far from this and too cold for our son,the internal pool caters for 7> and is charged at €20 an hr!(caps must be warn) It is currently out of season so obviously you expect reduced entertainment, that said, other than the children's play area and activities,there was no kids entertainment available for the evening!   The hotel provides a bus service to the old town and the new town! Even out of season, the service is well used! It would be good if there were more buses in the afternoon,but this may change in the summerOut of season at least, I would say this hotel was better suited for adults only"
Mar 2018,30,5stars,I have been at this hotel  7 days and  I cannot see how this hotel gained 5stars the food most night are either stew or cooked in garlic there was no choice if you didn’t like stew or garlic .most nights I only had a cheese roll this the first hotel where I had to buy my water for the table for my evening meal
Mar 2018,50,Cannot Fault At All,"Mostly 5 out of 5 really cant find a fault. Location mile or so from the old town but restaurants and bars nearby. Stayed in apartment very pleased with quality. Breakfast superb with vast selection of different foods, drinks."
Mar 2018,50,Beautiful Place,"It’s a beautiful place I would definitely go again. Went end of feb so it was less busy. Staff are very helpful, the free shuttle bus into the old and new city makes travel easier if you are not driving. The only thing I would have liked was coffee facilities and a pair of slippers in the room. I wish a had paid a few more £s for a room with a sea view. Restaurants, bars, swimming pools ++ ."
Mar 2018,40,Really grand hotel,"We booked for self catering but found no sea views that were stated by booking site. Hotel was very accommodating and found us a room in main building which overlooked the beach and we were not disappointed. Lovely room but a rather forgetful maid who would clean room and remove bathroom items and not replace them. It became a game in the end and we regularly checked the room on return and had a good laugh. Overall, a very lovely stay in beautiful surroundings. Main restaurant had wide selection of food for all tastes and the staff were very amicable and efficient. Worthy of praise. It would have been a touch more pleasant if we didn't have rain most of the week but car hire helped fill the time to visit old haunts."
Mar 2018,50,Grand it is ...,"Upon arrival you are treated to beautiful gated entrance, very private and inviting. The reception area is very open with gleaming floors and staircase. Checking in was a breeze, many staff available , and super friendly. Our booking included breakfast, and sea view room, but was located below the lobby because it is built on a hillside. Super large room with wall to wall patio doors, with large bathroom with bidet. Remember that is is located on the outskirts of the new town Albufeira , so getting to the new town commercial area is a 15 minute walk , and walking to the old town will require about 45 minutes walking. The hotel provides a shuttle 5 times daily with stops along the route , so bring shopping bags if you wish to pick up goodies for your room. The front desk will help you with everything you need. They were wonderful and knowledgeable. They suggested car rental company , provided parking free of charge, and our car was delivered at the door and left there upon end of our contract.We chose ""local car"" company, paid for 3 days and got 2 free days , all insurance in it cost $120 euros for a VW Polo.Daily breakfast was the one of the better ones we have had during our many trips. Specialty cheeses, fresh fruit, pastries, and your standard fare. The eating area is big with views of the ocean, surrounded with outside eating areas if you wish to consume in open air.The beach area is relativity small but rock abutments abound to make it picturesque. Access is through gated doors with many steps to reach the beach . The gates open with your room key so remember to bring it with you. You will find a café on your way to the beach after you cross the gates.The restaurants in the hotel are on the expensive side, but a short walk to your left at the entrance will bring you to many restaurants. We tried many with the tourist menu , meaning that you get a 3 course meal with choice of beverages for around $25 euros per couple. Our favourites were Ribeiro, Paulu's, Raina for ribs, but really they are all good, and very affordable. Service was excellent and friendly. Communicating in English was no problem. It is rated 5 stars and it is ...!"
Mar 2018,40,not a 5 star hotel,"Nice hotel in very good location. Very good service and a lot of space in lobby, also nice bar but is all very nice. As for 5 star should never be :- empty minibar- 20 euro for using swimming pool !!- avarage quality food for dinner- plastic cups in room- not tea and caffe in room- not in every bar you can charge to room- for towel to pook you must go 1 floor up to take it from reception- can't go to indoor pool with kids"
Mar 2018,50,Amazing Location,"From the coach turning into the fates of the complex I knew this was going to be a great holiday. Quick and efficient check in. Very good room, but not sea facing, but this wasn’t an issue. Amazing views from hotel terrace. All areas very clean and tidy. Great choice at breakfast including Buck’s Fizz. Good quality food. Easy walk to local shops and restaurants and a free shuttle bus to The Strip and Old Town."
Mar 2018,40,Relaxing break....,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Good location. Picturesque.We had excellent weather. Good walks if tide is out and have suitable footwear. Able to walk from old town having taken hotel bus to Old tow . Good suite with views of pool and sea. Would recommend asking for a sunny room in February. Ours was in the shade PM  but only there for 4 nights so not worth complaining. Breakfast was good, though cooked was lukewarm so had fresh fruits Etc. Lovely cava for celebratory breakfasts too! We were attacked by 2 German shepherds on the beach in front of the hotel on our last day. Spent 6.5 hours in A and E on return, on antibiotics and had a tetanus! We hope this is an extraordinary occurrence in this area. The hotel staff were as shocked as us so can't be normal!?! No feedback as yet if the dogs were captured! Please beware of dogs in this area. A frightful experience."
Mar 2018,50,Fabulous hotel,"We have been visiting this hotel in February for the last 5 years and would highly recommend it. The hotel is fabulous in a perfect location The staff are all very friendly, welcoming and professional."
Mar 2018,40,Very nice hotel and facilities.,Visited the hotel for a 4 night trip between 27th Feb and 3rd March. The hotel is very nice and spacious and the rooms were very clean and tidy and beds were big! Hotel is in a good location with free shuttle service which takes you to the new town and old town.Buffet breakfast was very nice with a lot of variety and offered gluten free bread and cakes for breakfast! Hotel restaurant also had the option of providing burgers on gluten free bread. Hotel staff very helpful and friendly would definitely stay here again should we visit Albufiera. Only downside - No kettle and tea making facilities in the room and did not offer late checkout on final day as our shuttle back to airport was at 2pm so had to wait in lobby for 2 hours.
Mar 2018,50,Ticks all the boxes,"This is a great hotel - right on the beach, has everything you could possibly want from conference venues, massive meeting rooms, hotel rooms, self catering accommodation - everything.We stayed in a self-catering flat just behind the main hotel.  Was really nice.  Bedroom (king bed), bathroom, and open plan lounge dinning-room and kitchen.  Was big and there was a fold out bed in the lounge which I slept on and was perfect - very comfy.The hotel staff were superb.  My suitcase didn't arrive (got stuck in Lisbon).  They followed up for me, made sure it got delivered to the hotel and brought it right to my room.  They even helped out with toiletries while I waited for my bag to arrive."
Feb 2018,50,A &B,"Great location and facilities,staff very attentive and professional. Bedrooms spacious and serviced daily.The disappointment was the restaurant next to the lobby bar only had Burgers on the evening menu ,not good for a 5 star hotel.However overall an excellent hotel ,with superb standards."
Feb 2018,40,"Beautiful property, great food","We had a one bedroom apartment for 3 nights with a huge lovely patio and fully equiped kitchen, however, we decided not to cook during our time at the resort. We paid extra for breakfast & dinner meal plan and so very pleased we did. This was the best eating we enjoyed during our two weeks in Portugal. The buffets were excellent!We loved the resort views and out-door upper-level seating to relax and enjoy the beautiful beach and sunshine.The hotel is tucked away and not really close to anything.  It is approximately a 1 hour walk to the Old Town.  They do provide free daily buses from the resort on weekdays, however, we like to walk so opted to walk instead.  We also took advantage of the on-site gym.Overall a very enjoyable 3 days of bliss in a beautiful resort."
Feb 2018,40,Lovely hotel with a great beach and lots of pool options.,"Good food at the hotel, lovely lodges which all seem to have access to at least one pool. The beach is fantastic. Didn't get a chance to check out the spa facilities. Would happily return with family."
Feb 2018,50,Third visit to hotel,"3rd visit here. Lovely hotel, spotlessly clean, very relaxed great location p, easy walk to sunning beach, will be back next year. Rooms big, room 303. Superb view over bay, also has disabled access which was good for hubby. Food good, reception staff very helpful"
Feb 2018,50,Brilliant Hotel,5 day family stay - 2 adults and 3 teenagers. Fabulous hotel and self catering apartments. We stayed in a self catering apartment opposite the hotel and it was to a very high standard. It was cleaned daily and had a very good air-con system. It was my wife's birthday on the Friday and my twins on the Saturday. Hotel management and staff recognised both and sent champagne and cake to our apartment. Staff very helpful and friendly and the hotel facilities are excellent. We ate in both the main restaurant and the gourmet burger restaurant with the food in both very good. Other shops and restaurants only 10 mins walk away. Definitely will return
Feb 2018,50,Lovely hotel and facilities,"Stayed here for 7 nights with my close family. It was a wonderful experience -- two swimming pools, location adjacent to the beach, nightly entertainment and smartly decorated rooms. The highlight was the quality of the nightly buffet -- I never knew that the words ""quality"" and ""buffet"" could go together until I stayed at this hotel!"
Feb 2018,40,Pleasant hotel,This hotel is right on a beach outside Albefuira. There are lovely terraces and seating areas outsideThe lobby has comfortable sofas and seating areas There's a free shuttle bus into Albefuira that stops in a handy place in the old town at the sea front where there are great cafes and restaurants....lobster prawns sea bass etcUp the hill I found a shop with leather  shoes/bags.  I'm very pleased with my purchasesFor a supermarket at this time of year Leave the hotel and turn right when you reach the public road. About 7mn walk. Smaller nearer ones are closed right now. There's a good local restaurant about 5 mn last the supermarket on the right side Turn left on the public road to walk to Albefuira new town..About 15mn. I'd recommend taking the shuttle bus as the new town is very spread outStaff at the hotel are very helpful and efficient
Feb 2018,50,Great Spot for Company Events,"My company stayed here for our annual retreat. I'd definitely stay again and recommend it. My only complaint was the tub water would drain properly in my bathroom. From the moment I turned on the shower it filled up and took forever to go down. I tried to explain it to the staff cleaning person, but I wasn't able to explain it well since I don't speak Portuguese. But they cleaned the tub everyday, so it wasn't a huge deal. Great services and clean rooms."
Feb 2018,50,Great resort with kids fun,"We spent 10 days in this resort , hat a family apartment which was big enough. Especially the kids club was great, with swimming classes, our son started diving and fun shows in the evening. Food was great and more than enough-"
Feb 2018,30,january stay,"Try to avoid the level ""-2"" rooms they are ground level but they are near to the noisy areas. Avoid room 7 too as its bathroom smells - not fixed during our stay despite several reminders. VG breakfast with lots to choose from."
Feb 2018,50,Pearl of Albufeira,"The hotel was recommended to us and we were not disappointed. It was love for the first site. Fantastic location, beautiful panoramic view, friendly atmosphere, very kind and helpful staff. They were smiling from their heart. I could highly recommend them to relax there and enjoy the best of  Algarve."
Feb 2018,30,"Great hotel,if you love children ","We have spent  a week from our summer vacation there, and we booked a suite much earlier to safe costs. We stayed in 2BR facility, with sea view, with 2bathrooms which was v nice. Room was clean, well maintained, but there was an unpleasant smell from the bathroom several times, which appeared bit imperfect. The property is quite large, directly at the beach, but this is public beach, hotel offers no booking options for sun beds. These can be rented at 20€ per day per 2, otherwise you can lay on the sand. The beach was very crowded, there is only one restaurant. The pool area at the hotel is pretty big but in high season it is not easy to find a good spot. Breakfast was not too bad but if you come later than 8:45 you will queue to be seated and there will be lots of families with small kids.the same is true for the main pools although the hotel has separate facilities for families with children.  Also be aware that everyone can enter the Hotel premises and stay athe pool. There are several decent and inexpensive restaurants in walking distance for dinner and few for lunch, and few supermarkets.  Overall pretty good hotel provided you don’t mind crowded beach, pool area and children playing loud and running around. We would probably not return."
Jan 2018,50,Great value for money,"We booked hotel to be near with some friends. Value for money was excellent. The beds are huge but a bit hard. And the rooms were large, so large that the TV looked small. Would be an improvement if the TV would be higher on the wall in stead of standing on desk. For the rest: great hotel. Must be fun in summer too."
Jan 2018,50,Great January break,"We stayed as a family of four in two adjoining sea view suites in January. We have been travelling to Portugal for many years and we have stayed at the Grande Real before due to its great location to the beach, the superb views, and the wonderful team of staff that work tirelessly to ensure you have a great stay.We are returning again in March for 5 nights and will no doubt be booking again in the future!"
Jan 2018,40,Beautiful Hotel with firendly staff,"We really enjoyed our stay in room 230 of your hotel. Nice room, friendly staff, nice food......very relaxing. It gives you the feel of luxury. Only one downside: the beds were terrible!! Wooden boxes with mattrasses.......they squeak and creak with every movement you make. Hopefully they'll put new, modern (box-spring) beds in every room!!"
Jan 2018,50,Bliss,"Wonderful cuisine, friendly staff. Large room and veranda with fabulous view. Right above a lovely beach. Many local bars/restaurants closed for winter off-season, hotel breakfast buffet excellent especially the gorgeous slices of local oranges. Temperatures were like good British summer days, ideal for us. In the pool and sunning in January, not mad busy with people, what more could you want? Would love to go again."
Jan 2018,50,Great Hotel ***,"Beautiful hotel, been here three times already and will definitely be back.  The breakfast is superb, the lay out of the hotel connected to the beach is fantastic.  I would recommend this hotel to couples and families alike."
Jan 2018,50,Great hotel in fantastic location,"Really nice hotel. Spacious room and bathroom. The staff were fantastic - efficient, friendly, helpful. The location is great for a beach holiday - it's set on a really beautiful beach and also has swimming pools. There was a charge for use of the jacuzzi in the spa but the outdoor pools were available. The breakfasts were amazing - excellent choice buffet with lovely fresh foods; I would highly recommend including breakfast when booking the room because it was so good. We also ate in the hotel 1 night - a buffet which we were a bit disappointed with choice-wise, but what we ate was nice and the service was, as usual, fantastic. We also had room service 1 night which was very good - prompt service and piping hot food. If I had to mention anything I didn't like it was the enormous bed which we found slightly too firm - but we still slept well. We plan to visit Portugal again and I would definitely stay here."
Jan 2018,50,I loved this hotel.  ,"The hotel, the staff, the breakfast, the room was just perfect.The view from our room to the Beach was just stunning.Easy walk into town and staff just cannot do enough to help.Went on a caves and coastline tour.I'll be back for more 💜"
Jan 2018,50,Pleasant Experience,"The best and most enjoyable holiday I had for a long time. There was a small leak coming from ceiling in our apartment and we got an upgrade to bigger place,which we did not expect.,also complimentary breakfast & spa it made us feel special. Will be back again in June."
Jan 2018,40,Good value 4 night break,"Spent 4 nights here.  On arrival we were greeted warmly by receptionist and escorted by porter  to our apartment, this was very much appreciated by us as it was dark. It was warm and inviting on a cold December evening.  The apartment was spacious, very clean, and more cooking facilities than I had ever seen in a holiday hotel apartment.  Housekeeping was good - maid came every morning and thoroughly cleaned it.There was a courtesy bus service running to old and new town, which we used every day.  The hotel allowed us to stay on in the apartment on our final day, until 3.00pm with no extra charge, which was wonderful.  The only down side was the hotel location was just a wee bit too far out of the town, for us, the bus did not run in the evenings.  The hotel, while having live music most nights, had very few guests listening.   However our overall experience of it was good and certainly great value for the amount we paid."
Jan 2018,50,Excellent hotel with breathtaking views!,"I visited this resort Dec. 28 thru Jan 01, 2018 with my family (6 of us) and we were enchanted by this hotel and the Albuferia area. The hotel staff were very kind and caring and took the time to explain things to us as we needed. The buffet breakfast had something for everyone and was a great way to start the day. The views were beautiful and the sunbathing was comfortable and soothing with the sound of the waves crashing at the shore below. My adult children enjoyed the gym and hiking along the beach every day and  the trip into town was short where bars and restaurants were plentiful. We will definately plan a return trip to this wonderful resort!"
Jan 2018,40,Lovely hotel,We stayed in room 305 as b&b. Fantastic huge room overlooking sea. Large balcony. Comfortable enormous bed and large bathroom. Cleaned every day with fresh towels and bed linen. We did however ask the maids to leave cleaning for 1 or 2 days as didn't need it. Only downside with this room was there wasn't tea & coffee facilities in room. Bit of a let down. There is a mini fridge and safe. My advice is to take a travel kettle as there is a supermarket 10 mins walk away. Breakfast is buffet style and was excellent. A wide variety. Staff in restaurant excellent. Staff in bar grumpy and we had to jump up and down to get noticed and served. Fantastic pools and plenty of sun loungers. Front desk couldn't do enough for you. Credit to the hotel. Good gym and spa facilities. Loved the hotel although quite a walk to bars etc. Taxi to new town 6 euros and to old town 7 euros.
Jan 2018,50,Visiting on 19th jan,"Im due to visit albuferia on 19th jan there is going tp be 6 of us just seeing what bars e.t.c are still open were there 4 nights, were not too fussed about the weather but wanted to see if there is still a few and bars and that open to have a good old drink!!!????"
Jan 2018,30,This is not a 5* service,"Almost 1 hour waiting in a line for breakfast! ImpossiblePoor maintenance mainly in our bathroom were it was almost impossible to have a shower as the shower wasn't directing water correctly and was always moving. SPA personal very unfriendly, not polite and gave mixed information about the unacceptable cost to use the jets pool (20€ for arround one hour), never seen in any other 5* resort around the world. SPA area should also be better maintained and cleaned as the water line was thoroughly visible."
Jan 2018,50,Excellent stay again,"its rare that a hotel can keep up the standards it has set when it started, but this hotel has managed to do exactly that. polite staff, fantastic facilities. ideal for families and couples. never seen a hotel where the housekeeping cleans the guests dirty plates, pots and pans as well. keep it up guys."
Dec 2017,40,Christmas Holiday ,"Solo TravelHotel in quite location about 15 minuets walk to the new town but hotel runs a free shuttle service Tuesday to Friday, hotel complex rooms and amenities are 5 star but the staff are shocking really bad manners not one bit friendly I asked the receptionist to order me a taxi on one evening and he TUTTED at me , cleaning staff asked me to leave room so they could clean not one bit polite or friendly a huge let down to the hotel. The beach is right in front of the hotel really private and a nice relaxing walk I would recommend. Rooms are massive nice king bed tv and big bathroom no iron or tea making facilities which is a let down. PS the chocolates left on pillows are a nice touch."
Dec 2017,50,Best Holiday Place,"Delicious Meals, Nice apartments, restaurants, bars and friendly staff. I would recommend this place for a family holiday. Good relaxing place for whole family. Kids entertainment on point. Looking forward to visit again."
Dec 2017,50,Christmas getaway resort,We are a family of four and we’re looking to get away for Christmas. A holiday rep recommended this hotel for our stay when we mentioned we were considering Portugal.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and even our kids (11 year old girl and a 9 year old boy) who are normally very fussy and picky had nothing to complain about.Will visit again soon.Many thanks to all the staff who made our stay a pleasant experience.
Dec 2017,30,good for older adults and people love to be quiet.,"Perfect room, view, location (In terms of scenes). Food and stuff are very nice, especially kids club staff really good, second to none so far to my experience. But night entertainment was nightmare. Guitarist after guitarist, boring! Really put us off,  night life in the hotel is 0 for kids or adults. Not good for young families. But love everything else. No mini disco or night entertainment no coming back. Sorry."
Dec 2017,40,christmas stay at grande hotel santa eulalia,excellent value for money sometimes food in restaurant could have been a bit hotter and wifi was unavailable   in bedroom otherwise excellent value for money.hotel staff in all areas could not have been more pleasant and helpful
Dec 2017,30,Christmas break,The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. There didn’t seem to be much ambience about the hotel. We stayed half board and personally found the evening buffet to be repetitive and the food luke warm. The room was clean and the bed huge. We didn’t class this as a 5* hotel
Dec 2017,40,christmas in grande real,"good hotel . spacious . a little expensive for drinks . food could be better . setting was really good ...success to a lovely beach . staff are  good and friendly . clean rooms but standard room is basic for 5 star hotel.,"
Dec 2017,50,Wonderful family Christmas,"Lovely Christmas vacation.  Beautiful location, great kids club, staff friendly, good value overall. Lots of local restaurants within 15 mins walk of hotel.  We didn't eat dinner at hotel but Xmas lunch was very good.Lovely spa very affordable for thermal pool & sauna etc.Outdoor pool is heated but still chilly!We asked for a sunny room 463 was perfect.We will definitely be back!"
Dec 2017,30,Condition of room does not justify 5 stars,"First of all the positives,  the hotel sits on the beautiful Santa Eulalia beach with breathtaking views across the ocean,  the reception is a large open plan area with bar and entertainment area, the staff are informative and welcoming, the food - we booked the gala dinner on Christmas Eve and the Brunch on Christmas Day, the food on both occasions was of a high standard with attentive staff.The negative, the condition of our room and the poor WiFi signal the lack of charging points for mobile phones tablets etc.We were in room 108 this room needs a complete update, the carpet was badly stained and in my opinion should be removed from booking until the problem is rectified, we had a problem with the bath not draining water, the solution was to remove the bath plug, this solved the problem when taking a shower but removed the option to take a bath, basic standards for any hotel nevermind a five star, overall the stained carpet detracted from  our stay in this hotel, for the reasons stated this places this hotel 3-4 star certainly not 5 star."
Dec 2017,50,December weekend treat,"Stayed before at least 4 times.  Friendly staff, welcoming front desk.  Clean and well maintained.  Beautifully appointed hotel.  Our favourite beach so clean and relaxing to stroll along pre breakfast.Would most definitely return and recommend to friends and family ."
Dec 2017,50,grand real santa eulalia top class hotel,One of the best hotel experiences we have had .location food rooms and staff all without fault. will definately look for vacancies when we rerturn to portugal.  Everyone very helpful and friendly. Very clean and smart
Dec 2017,50,Superb hotel,"This was a last minute spontaneous break for us after a trip advisor email and this hotel was more than we had anticipated. We have been in this area before and wanted somewhere peaceful and close to the beach and also within walking distance to local amenities. We arrived very early and receptionist was extremely helpful and as our room was ready we went straight there. The room and ensuite bathroom (shower in bath) was spotless and the balcony was a generous size and overlooked the beach. The bed was large and comfortable. We had booked breakfast which was fabulous, so much choice was wonderful and the staff were pleasant and helpful. There are a couple of restaurants and beach snack bar at the hotel. We had snacks at the beach bar - good food with reasonable prices with gorgeous views. We walked into the Strip (10 mins) at nights for food and one night to Olhos d'Agua (30 mins) so even off season great location. The hotel operate a return courtesy bus several times per day into Albuefeira which was a fantastic resource. The Spa is lovely and reasonably priced. The pools look lovely but it was a bit chilly in late November to swim! Great wifi throughout. Would certainly return and fully recommend. I guess summer would be a completely different experience but the resort is spacious, has car parking is at the beach and you could spend a whole holiday without leaving the resort."
Dec 2017,40,Beautiful setting : right onto the beach,"We went looking for warmer climes for a short break in Dec. Very well priced 67 euros for a double room for two with buffet breakfast, which was varied and of a good quality ,  and a solid 4 star hotel but not really a 5 : we have provoked and paid for a spa session for 2 ( not included🤔) but was disappointed that the water temperature was only 30°c and so we couldn't avail of the facilities ( sauna, Jacuzzi, jet pool and Turkish steam room). We were refunded the extra payment but it was one of the reasons for booking to stay there so disappointed. The layout of the hotel is pleasing with direct access onto a beautiful sandy beach. A free shuttle bus available but a car is perhaps recommendable though not essential. Booked directly through hotel's own website: supposed to have been given a room upgrade for doing so  but it wasnt provided."
Dec 2017,50,Very good,Lights  when in bed poor. Unable to do crossword or read paper. Tea making facilities in room would be very much appreaciated. Speaking from over 55 age group. Absence of complimentary bus service to old and new town on Saturday and Sunday can be a disadvantage.
Dec 2017,50,Lovely place for conference and family stay,Went for a conference and stayed on.Lovely and quiet overlooking beautiful sea. 3 pools (2 warm) at the front.  Good rooms with balconies and lovely food with a superb breakfast.Local area pretty with plenty to do.  Town is a short walk or free shuttle away.Friendly staff and lovely beach.Great kids club and playground too!  Plus a beach side restaurant.Definitely coming back.
Dec 2017,50,Superb Week In Self Catering Luxury Apartment,"We just had a great week staying in the luxury apartments of The Grande Real Santa Eulilia Hotel/ Resort in Albefeuria. The service, setting & facilities were superb. We really enjoyed ourselves & will definitely return. We got excellent value,as it was out of season in December,but the weather was a very pleasant late teens/early twenties & consequently we got excellent value."
Dec 2017,40,"Hotel is big, the rooms are large.","The hotel was basically empty because of time of year. It was still sunny and bright about 16-17 degrees during the day. The breakfast was a delight and would accommodate anyone’s needs.My biggest gripe was with this large empty hotel we were given a room on the cold north east wind side where the sun never shone. Not what was required after leaving a cold wet England. We could have had our wine on the balcony in the afternoon sun, instead we did not open our balcony door Incase we froze in the cold wind."
Dec 2017,40,Great location,Extremely comfortable hotel with plenty facilities . Breakfast was outstanding with both cooked and continental selections. Courtesy bus to albufeira was great. Surrounding area quiet at this time of year however still plenty bars and restaurants open. Hotel on the main bus route for faro and albufeira bus station. Excellent wifi .
Dec 2017,50,"Spacious, lots of restaurants,4 pools, Fantastic Spa facility","Huge apartment space, tv, lots of wardrobe space, kitchen facilities, hob, kettle, toaster, microwave oven, utensils, fridge...spacious balcony. Staff very helpful, Spa staff very professional. Private beach, palm trees.....lovely!"
Dec 2017,50,Great clean hotel with superb facilities and friendly staff,"Visited for one night only but were left with wanting more. The reception welcome was great and offered a sea view as low season. Fantastic room, clean, roomy and a very very comfortable bed. The breakfast was worth the room rate alone and so much choice. The grounds were immaculate and the walk to the beech Quick and easy. Thoroughly recommend."
Dec 2017,50,6 night stay in November with my daughters,"Thank you, for a lovely, memorable stay at your very impressive hotel. The apartment was spot on, loved the extra large bed and kitchen facilities. The staff were very attentive and helpful, looking forward to a return trip as soon as possible"
Dec 2017,40,Lovely resort with private access to a beautiful beach,"The staff and the resort were excellent. Any issues we had were resolved quickly and with a personal touch, made our stay that much more enjoyable. The apartments are spacious and have an outdoor patio area and large doors. The cooking facilities are useful and the staff will wash up for you, but I bought own cleaning equipment. Would have been useful to have condiments for cooking provided. The larger supermarket is a 10 mins walk with a slope so not the most convenient to get shopping. But still, useful for getting everyday items. The shuttle bus stops in new town and old town. I think this would have benefited from an extra stop at the Albufeira Shopping centre.I enjoyed Atlantico restaurant very much, delicious food and fabulous view. The gourmet burgers at pergula were delicious too but as it is just burgers, not a place to go to more than once or twice. The evening dinner in the main restaurant was, frankly, awful. Service was incredibly slow, the food was slow in coming out and incredibly salty. Did not appreciate the snobbery for refusing me a glass of tap water! I had much nicer meals on the restaurant strip 10 mins away."
Dec 2017,50,Best hotel,Verry nice experience. Best hotel. I will come back with first ocasion. The breakfast is the best. Wonderfull moments. Wonderful view on the balcony. I'll recomanded for familly and for friends too. Try burger on the restaurant. It's the best
Dec 2017,50,Fabulous stay,The whole resort had a 5star feeling to it. Our luggage was transferred to our apartment via golf style buggy. There was a free bus to the New and Old towns. There were no noise issues such as busy roads or loud music. I would recommend.
Nov 2017,40,Holiday,"The hotel's location is great, however i would not consider it as a 5* hotel based on the following.The hotel is old and tired, there is no indoor pool and the equipment in the gym are rusty and need attention. Spa is too expensive.However, the staff are very friendly, polite and helpful, also the rooms are very clean and specious.But, I found the food is blend and ordinary for 5* hotel. and the entertainment is poor.  But the beach and the view is great. We stayed 11 day and enjoyed it."
Nov 2017,50,Impressive site & excellent service,"Although out of peak season, the service was fully efficient, and everything was accessible end clean. The view from the room was outstanding. A pleasant stay in one of the best beaches in Algarve...."
Nov 2017,50,Beautiful and peaceful,Wish I could have spent another week there!! People lovely service great complimentary shuttle into old and new town. Apartment perfect.  Lovely relaxing week in November cant wait to come back hopefully before next November
Nov 2017,50,Fantastic experience and excellent leisury break,"We had a fantastic, professional service which added to the leisure break experience.  The location, weather and services were fantastic! Thank you! We will have a lovely memories from our stay. And we will be back..."
Nov 2017,30,Tired in all areas,"Having stayed at this hotel & the sister hotel in Olhao l feel equipped to give a reasonable assessment of the Real group. I rated Real Grande 4 out of 5 & Santa Eulalia as you can see lower.Building works (rooms being oak laminated) were generally unobtrusive, but dust was all over the corridors and carpets, even in areas. Going down to dinner one evening, I thought we'd been gas attacked! The stench was nauseating.Food is of good quality & my huge sea-view room was superb, but apart from the main bar all other public areas are tired, although the Aztec them does mask the problem a little. Attention to the little details is generally not observed....Flickering light bulbs not changed; guests being allowed to ""vape"" in the bar area is a disgrace.All in all disappointed."
Nov 2017,50,Amazing hotel.,"It was a really nice experience, with o good selection for the breakfast, with friendly staff. The hotel is very clean, like the beach as well. I will definitely come back on the summer time. This only disappointment was that I payed for a see view room, and it was not. I could see the sea only from one side from the balcony. But was nice."
Nov 2017,50,Superb hotel!,"My first time staying at this hotel and was very impressed with the outstanding customer service from all staff! I had a lovely holiday and would defiantly go back. Great location on a private  beach, very high standard of hygenie throughout the hotel a and good choice of restaurants in the resort. Overall very happy with my stay and look forward to going back. Even through it was out of season there was still enough options for eating out and day trips."
Nov 2017,50,superb hotel,"5 star well deserved!!!!. Beautiful hotel with a lovely private beach. Very attentive friendly staff. Nothing was to much trouble .All  areas were spotlessly clean, Good sized rooms and bathrooms.  Excellent food!!!! Freshly cooked and  a great variety. The best I have come across.  Can't fault anything about this hotel.  Had a  wonderful relaxing holiday. I would recommend this hotel without hesitation. Hope to return in the future."
Nov 2017,40,My stay in Portugal at Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa,"The apartments need some TCL. Sofa and centre table need cleaning or changing. Did not expect to see dirt/stain in a 5☆ hotel. The mattress is hard. My partner found it very difficult to sleep on. This was my 3rd time in Portugal and found all the beds in the 3 hotels I have stayed are hard.  I think this is a Portugal thing, not everyone has a bad back. Orthopaedic mattress. The cleaners do a good job of cleaning.  Towels bed sheets and pillows were very clean. No sweaty pillows. Overall I love this hotel. This is the best hotel I stayed at in Portugal. This was also my partners birthday trip and his first time in Portugal.  The hotel surprise us with a cake and bottle of wine. This was very lovely. The restaurant next to reception we had burger and chips on our 1st evening.  There was a long black hair in the chips. Kitchen staff need to cover there hair to prevent this from happening."
Nov 2017,50,Excellent 3 night stay,staff noticed when photocopying or passports that it was my husbands Bday & gave us a complimentary bottle of chilled prosecco & Bday cake to the room (complete with lighter to light candle on cake!) very thoughtful - & attention to detail second to none
Nov 2017,50,Super relaxed,"Was astonished about the friendliness and service in a relaxed atmosphere, although it is a big hotel.Maybe also traveling ""out of season"" helped.Many offers for relaxing, shopping, touring and an overall super beach."
Nov 2017,50,One of the best hotels,"Had a great stay last week. We thought the overall standard and service was excellent and will definitely be back next year.  The shuttle bus service is also very good, but the distance to main shops and bars is easily walkable and very enjoyable."
Nov 2017,50,alan &christine belfast,eat hotel in every way staff most helpful and courteous. excellent food and great rooms with great bathroom and hot water at all times. will be booking for a week in may 2018. we had a great holiday and cant wait to return . thanks to everyone for a fantastic holiday..
Nov 2017,30,Good but not five star.,"We went to Grande, in the middle of November with exceptional weather. The location of hotel is nice, but if it didn't have the addition of a private beach then we probably wouldn't of booked a stay. I can imagine this place getting super packed in peak season, so it was nice having the place quiet. We had our little toddler with us and we stayed in a self catering apartment, this was challenging when every light switch and some drawers were accessible and the front door wasn't lockable from the inside and found ourselves placing the buggy in front of the door to stop him getting out, the sliding doors across the cooking area was a good idea.The apartment was fine although some worn decor need some attention. The cleaning service was very good. The breakfast food was good if your'e not a fussy eater, for a 5 star you'd expect a better waiting service, and when sat by the pool it would of been nice to have somebody bring drinks,The heated pool wasn't that ""heated"" but bearable. They have a inside pool, but this is astronomically priced at $19 for just 1 hour. hence why no-one was in it. So not good. The beach being the main highlight of the resort, I thought at least having some recliners/sunbeds on the beach would've been the least they could have supplied. For a off peak price it was value for money but we wouldn't pay peak prices.The staff were friendly enough, and would visit again if it was the right price."
Nov 2017,50,Outstanding service :)),On arrival to the hotel we were welcomed by the friendly staff who provided us with all the information we needed for our stay. The rooms were fernishsd to a very high standered with a nice sized balcony with fantastic views. There was a huge variety of food at the hotel that was delicious and great value. The spa facilities added a nice relaxing retreat that you were able to endulge in at your choice not to mention the gym. Lastly the shuttle bus service that brought you to and from the old and new town was efficient and always on time. This was our first visit to portugal as a couple and are already excited to book out next trip. Not only is it a great romantic holiday it is perfect for families too.
Nov 2017,30,Not a Five Star,"We stayed as a family x 6 October/November 2017 and we were very disappointed with our stay.  It is not a 5 star - 3 to 4 star at best.  Our apartment was clean but definitely in need of an upgrade.  The hotel itself is welcoming and clean.  Reception were friendly.  We stayed on a half board basis - breakfast was very good but evening buffet was very poor in both quality and choice of food.  To make things worse the food was lukewarm at best.  In fact we ate there only twice.  There is an excellent shuttle service.  The pools are nice but when he stayed there, it seemed to have closed down for the season.  The outside snack bars were closed.  The kiddie club was excellent, however their playground could be bigger - we were there in the quiet season, I cant imagine what it must be like in high season with kids - very much needs to be bigger.  Will I go back to this hotel - a definite No."
Nov 2017,50,wonderful place to stay,"We stayed in November, and the weather was brilliant, warm and sunny every day. We spent our days on the stunning beach, lunches at the atlantico bar, which has to be the most picture perfect beach bar we have ever seen. Food and services were good too. We had a sea view suite which was very spacious, with 2 bathrooms and a very comfortable bed. It was spotlessly clean. Would highly recommend this hotel at this time of year if you want a very relaxing holiday"
Nov 2017,50,Great Hotel,"great hotel, friendly staff, lots of restaurants, nice pools although only one was heated. overall a great experience. the location is secluded but thats what i went there for. lovely venue though and the breakfast was well worth it"
Nov 2017,50,Excellent customer service,"Just back from amazing stay in Grande Real Santa Eulalia. The staff at reception are so helpful and friendly and really go out of their way for you. The hotel and apartments are the cleanest I’ve ever seen, the cleaning staff do an amazing job. I would highly recommend this hotel as it is so secure for families and is the nicest hotel in Albufeira by far. We will definitely return some day!"
Nov 2017,50,excellent,beautiful hotel will visit again professional service and excellent staff very clean and serviced hotel great location shuttle bus was very nice service into town very relaxing will visit again thanks for everything family visit
Nov 2017,50,Excellent,My Husband and I stayed last week on a bed and breakfast basics and we were delighted with our stay. Hotel is in a beautiful setting. All staff very helpful and professional. Room amazing with a great sea view (213) Comfortable beds.  Breakfast amazing. Our stay was perfect and we would highly recommend this hotel and area. Many thanks to everyone who provided an excellent service and made out stay wonderful. All staff should be very proud of their high standards of service provided.
Nov 2017,40,Lovely resort,"Hotel was in good location 10 mins from shops restaurants, the rooms were cleaned daily and cleaned well, outside pools very cold but then is was November but the pool areas very nice, well equipped gym, lovely beach, would stay again"
Nov 2017,50,The best apartment ever !!,"What a fantastic place to stay! Everything in this place is just first class. We are currently staying in one of the apartments and could not see any single fault in this place. Rooms are being cleaned every day, the place is so relaxing , very quiet at nights and we always had a good night sleep. We will be sad to go later today but will definitely come back next time. My son who is 7 haven't been to the kids club so I cannot comment on that but the stunning beach and surrounding areas are more than enough for him/us getting entertained. The staff who cleaned our room deserved a massive thank you and recognition, not only it was Cleaned but also a personal touch was added to it. It was the way my sons toys were arranged, how lovely! It made my son so happy , so thank you so much."
Nov 2017,50,Honeymoon,Couldn’t fault our visit from start to finish. All staff were very friendly and helpful. The room we got was a suite and it was beautiful. An excellent place to spend a honeymoon or special event as a treat .
Nov 2017,50,Excellent Location,"Fabulous location right on beach, hotel very comfortable and having an upgrade to the rooms when we were there, so maybe better again in future - have stayed before and will return again. Bus into Albuferia very handy and adds some varaiation to the stay. Food in hotel good and bars offer good service. Beach side bar good value and pleasant addition to hotel. We stayed in November (weather was excellent) but cant verify how busy the hotel is in mid summer - but has pool sidecafe/bars and nightclub also, so could be good fun for all ages."
Nov 2017,50,Disabled Access,"The hotel definitely needs to upgrade access, ie flat routes to compliment the cobbled areas, the route to the beach was horrendous all cobbles also no disabled access to the paths in front of the beach bar or to same"
Nov 2017,40,summer/winter holiday,Surroundings and beach was fantastic and weather for time of year could not of been better.Apartment was very suitable but would been better with a balcony facing the sun.Hotel was very accessible to all Patrons had a nice time might come back sometime in the future.
Nov 2017,50,Fantastic stay at a fantastic hotel!,"Overall, fantastic stay at this hotel. Its 5 star rating has truly been earned! Our best trip to Portugal to date! Special thanks to Rafael at the hotel bar for his friendliness and attentive service during our stay."
Nov 2017,50,Lovely resort,Lovely resort our 5th visit. Close to local bars and restaurants about a 10 min walk left out of the resort. A 15 min taxi ride to old town. We stayed in an apartment which has a small kitchen. The food in the local bars and restaurants is relatively cheap so not really worth buying food in the supermarket.
Nov 2017,50,Another great stay !,"This has to be hands down the best Hotel in the Algarve This was our 9th or 10th visit.Why look for anywhere else ,They have everything here .....Access to the beach plenty of pools .Great food ,wonderful staff,beautiful rooms,There is nothing else anyone could wish for and we have travelled a lot.I travelled with my daughter and granddaughter and there was plenty of activities to suit all tastes.We had a suite this time and it worked out very well.We will be back in the Summer"
Nov 2017,40,Honeymoon,"Fabulous hotel , location. Not ideal for young people in October not a lot going on! Albufeira is a very relaxed place this time of year. The natives are extremely nice do everything they can for you. Overall it was a well deserved, relaxed break  👰🤵"
Nov 2017,50,Great holiday,Great hotel. Went self-catering. Quiet location. Ideal for a relaxed holiday. All facilities available if required. Staff there to help if needed. Nothing too much trouble.Apartments well equipped. Cleaned every day. Maintenance staff very efficient.
Nov 2017,50,Beautiful hotel with great staff.,"This beautiful hotel is very impressive and their staff are so friendly and helpful that it’s a pleasure to stay there. We had a sea view room and the sea is so close you can hear the waves washing onto the beach. Lots of places to sit and enjoy the 3 pools and the bar. We enjoyed it so much we have already booked to return at Easter, can’t wait  Hotel really is 5*"
Nov 2017,50,Can’t get enough of this place,"Have been 3 times and coming back in April.  This hotel ticks all the boxes for us.  We are a family five, 2 adults and 3 children between ages 2 and 9.  Would like a little more ambience at the restaurants and more entertainment, but aside from that we love it.  Incredible location and very helpful staff."
Nov 2017,50,TOTAL REAL RELAX,Hotel and location 1st Class!  Hotel and all staff make this a very relaxed and calm place to spend a holiday.   Great facilities and lots of very kind and efficient staff.   Excellent food and lovely restaurants.
Nov 2017,40,WKC World Championships stay,"Very nice hotel, with very helpful staff, prices in bars and restaurants are reasonable for a hotel of this category. Had a great stay during the event which my son took part in. Nice pool area to relax after the competitions, lovely beach. Loved the free shuttle bus into town.Rooms could be a little bigger."
Nov 2017,50,Just as good as ever 6th time round....,Some places change over the years and no doubt there have been subtle changes here and there with this hotel but the important stuff has been consistently good if not better each time we visit. Very reasonable bar prices. Excellent kids club staff.
Nov 2017,30,Lovely hotel but staff seem demotivated ,"We were at this hotel for 2 weeks, half board. The food was lovely and the facilities very good especially the kids club. However, the staff were generally grumpy. Hardly a greeting and never a smile even though we were there eating everyday. The main building was lovely but the apartments need some modernising. I think some staff training would go a long way into making this hotel a true 5 star resort."
Nov 2017,40,Relaxing Long Weekend Break,"Very nice hotel set in extensive, well maintained grounds. Although rated as a 5 star, I feel that some areas could be improved to a 5 star overall level compared to some 4 or even excellent 3 star previously stayed in. We had a suite in the main hotel with sea view that was very clean and spacious size, but feel that a fridge would be much better in the room rather than mini bar and also tea/coffee facilities should be standard in each room (not having to request if desired). All towels are provided, including pool/beach, and toiletries - handy when only travelling with hand luggage. The resort sits overlooking the beach at Santa Eulalia but is not private to the hotel. Sun beds etc are no longer available for hire in the winter season. The fish restaurant on the beach is also out of season. Numerous areas/restaurants/Le Club of the resort are closed for the winter, although Atlantico Cafe overlooking beach was excellent for lunch with an extensive menu. Cocktails in the main bar, highly recommended.The pool area is very pleasant and enjoyable to have breakfast if desired. Breakfast was super with lots of choice. All staff were friendly and polite.Numerous bars, restaurants, supermarkets are within walking distance - turn right when leaving resort towards Olhos de Agua or left takes you to Santa Eulalia/Oura/ New Town and The Strip."
Nov 2017,40,Wedding Stay.,The hotel was fabulous - the food in the hotel bar was very expensive - I ordered 5 toasted ham and cheese 4 fries and 4 cokes 2 beers and it cost 101.90 . . outside bar was very limited in drinks but I guess it was end of season so its to be expected - But they new we were a large group coming for my wedding they should of stocked it better. the Beds were so uncomfortable I didnt sleep much but thats just me maybe invest in proper mattresses for the apartments the hotel beds were lovely and comfy. over all it was a pleasant stay and I would return but maybe to the hotel part not the Apartments. Wifi was non-existent in the main bedroom due to the thick walls might be a good idea to install a repeater to boast signal. my phone bill will be huge :( . . defo coming back though.
Nov 2017,30,5 Stars should be better,"...for a hotel with 5 star classification: Kids club ok, evening entertainment very poor, breakfast and lunch in a noisy atmosphere with poor ambiente, staff friendly, to many hotel-facilities closed, no timeslots for kids in the SPA area (shall be published before), hotel and resort areas very clean, the rooms too."
Nov 2017,50,On holiday in Portugal.,Went to see the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort Hotel as our daughter is getting married there next year. Must say this is a quality Hotel staff were really nice. We told them of the wedding and they showed us apartments and rooms and then treated us to a drink out on the main veranda.Really good thanks Grande Santa Real.
Nov 2017,40,Enjoyable stay,"This was our 4th time we have stayed here in the last 4 years which I think speaks for itself. It is a beautiful hotel with good facilities in a good location but the rooms are becoming a little ""tired""  Having said that work has recently started to refurbish them . The carpets are being replaced with laminate and the rooms are being redecorated . Cant wait to return next year to see the finished product."
Nov 2017,50,Fantastic Hotel for all.,"I stayed here with my pregnant wife looking for a nice relaxing holiday and overall was not disappointed. Expecting our first child we were looking for a special holiday as it would be our last as just a two. This is the reason we chose Santa Eulalia, the 5 star rating, excellent reviews and reasonable price. First of all the journey from the airport is not bad at all, roughly around 40 mins. We booked transfers prior to the journey, which I highly recommend as we got a great deal, so I'm not sure how much it would cost in a taxi. When we first arrived, we were amazed by the look of the hotel. It resembles a gated community with the apartments near the entrance and a drive up to the main hotel building. Stunning decor inside with nice big comfy couches to sit and relax. Check in was quick and easy, our room was ready before the stated time and alot of information was given about local attractions and excursions, couldn't fault the staff at all. We stayed in a double / twin room with a resort view (I think the cheapest room), although the least expensive in price it was spacious and very much up to the standard of what you would expect from a 5 star rating. Plenty of wardrobe space, fridge, shower/ bath, TV. The only fault I could find was the signal on the TV. There wasn't a variety of channels and more than half had poor signal, this didn't bother me however as I wouldn't come on holiday to watch TV! The location, in my opinion, is absolutely perfect. From what I gathered the resort had its own private beach which was quite big, there was alot of space to relax and wasn't crowded. Access to the beach is through a gate where you scan your room key (this, quite embarrassingly, puzzled us until we see someone do it as no one told us this information!) The sand can be abit stoney in areas but there's nice soft sand in most areas. The hotel provides shuttle transfers to both the New Town and Old Town around 4 or 5 times a day although the last one is before dinner, 6.25pm, maybe a cunning way to get you to eat and then stay in the hotel for drinks after! A taxi to either is inexpensive, walking is possible to the New Town which we did a few times, although up a Hill!  Onto the food. We were half board so had breakfast and dinner included. I thought a nice touch was to allow you to use your dinner voucher for a 3 course lunch meal which was delicious with alot of choice. Breakfast was a buffet style with a wide variety which would satisfy anyone and everyone, I discovered the pancakes and Nutella on the very last day which I was devastated about! Everything you would want in a good old fashioned English fry up apart from the sausages which I don't think anyone liked! Also, free champagne at breakfast? Wow.Dinner. Different everyday and never your typical burger and chips, which I find a good thing. Alot of fish, vegetarian and meat dishes to satisfy everyone. Desserts were fantastic, definitely impressive. The only issue was with the temperature of the food, it was never hot, always lukewarm. Maybe it was due to there not being many people at dinner or the time we were going but it definitely needs looking at by management as I've seen it mentioned in other reviews. A nice hot meal would make it 10/10 for food. As both the breakfast and dinner were served in the Real Corzinha restaurant I can't comment on the others, I did have a few drinks in the bar in reception, (Perugula) I think? This was very nice, cocktails were fantastic, staff, excellent. Facilities and entertainment. There were a few different pool areas which meant they were never crowded which was nice, this time of year meant they were absolutely freezing though! There is a spa and gym there but with the gyms old rusting equipment and the charge of 20 euros for 45 mins in the spa pool, I can't see how anyone ever uses either! I don't know if the spa is run through a separate company but the prices are absurd, some treatments and massages were nearly 150€, maybe most guests have more money than I do but I definitely wouldn't want to be ripped off, spa's we found in the old town were half the price. However, more positively entertainment was fantastic. There's a kids club and an activity schedule for children and adults to enjoy. Live music every evening was up to a high standard and a nice way to relax after a meal.Despite a couple of small moans we very much enjoyed our stay here and would 100% return. Thank you to the excellent staff and hotel for making the holiday a memorable one."
Nov 2017,50,Excellent stay,"Excellent facilities with a multitude of bars, restaurants and pools. Great for family stay. Slight issue with broken bath plug and tired balcony seats but staff were quick and kind to fix.Went for nippers birthday and delighted with the unexpected surprise Happy Birthday cake and champagne really sweet touch to top a nice short getaway! Staff friendly and attentive, would highly recommend, full of families with young children this time of year which was nice for our nipper in the great pools. Awesome views from the hotel of the beach, sea and green landscape."
Nov 2017,40,Good,"Polite reception, quiet and clean room, but I strongly recommend that if you want to reserve online, just choose ""free cancel"" I did a mistake while choosing the dates and I had to cancel my reservation with payment"
Nov 2017,50,Photosynthetic championships,"O stayed her for kickboxing world chapionships , hotel was lovely and staff friendly not a long walk in to town but they do have a free bus running. I would stay here on a proper holiday, room and apartment are grate and clean. Quick walk to the beach which has a cafe along the way with dose amazing ice cream"
Nov 2017,50,Valentyna,"Excellent brake, every time i go to this hotel i enjoy my stay very much .Real 5 star hotel.Think rooms getting a bit dated but even so this is miner things over all. Will for sure come back again and recommend all my friends to visit too."
Nov 2017,50,Fantastic hotel,"This is our second year in October to visit and the hotel is fantastic, with great food and facilities. It is scrupulously clean and the staff are great. The hotel is nicely situated to visit Alubeferia and Vilamoura, plus many local areas. Cant wait to go back again. 😀"
Oct 2017,50,Surprised by lack of security in this day,"The Hotel and Staff were great , our apartment was of a beautiful standard and the housekeeping staff do a brilliant job , We found every part of the hotel is kept to a beautiful standard including the pools and outside terraces , My Only concern in the day and age that there is no security checking who is going in and out of the facilities"
Oct 2017,50,Relaxing family holiday,"Second visit to this hotel, service and food is always excellent, stayed in a suite both times so that our teenager has her own bedroom and bathroom.Half board option is excellent for a buffet breakfast and buffet evening meal, with lots of choice and quality food on offer."
Oct 2017,50,Sister Abroad,"Wonderful hotel, can't fault a thing. Staff friendly. Food and service excellent.Rooms very clean and spacious.Views and pool areas excellent.Good for all types, families, couples, young and older travellers. Wouldn't recommend for Stag or Hen holidays.Beautiful setting in a quiet area but not far from the buzz of the main strip. A small taxi journey or the free shuttle bus to the Old Town Area."
Oct 2017,40,Generally a very pleasant stay,"Pool was a bit cool, environment was excellent, beach easily accessible and beautiful.  Few external restaurants close to the hotel.  Everything was very clean and the hotel was good in taking care of luggage on the day of check out and offering an excellent shower and towel."
Oct 2017,50,October 2017,"This is a lovely resort. It has private access to a beach just a short 5-10 minute walk from the rooms (there are a lot of steps though). The drinks were cold, the suites were incredibly comfortable and spacious. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We went towards the end of the season so the club was not open. Everything was very clean.The internet only worked in your room - and sometimes on the balcony. You did not have wifi throughout the resort unless you were in the main lobby/area of the hotel. The beach restaurant was a bit pricey and did not have as many options as we would have liked. With the price you pay, it would be nice to have breakfast included."
Oct 2017,40,4 Star Review of the 5 Star Hotel,"Firstly, we love this hotel and apartment complex and have visited it for the 5th time last week. I'll list, in no particular order the things that draw us back and areas I think need improvement. Location - everything from an easy flight from Belfast, short drive or bus trip to Albufeira, the hotel perched above the best beach on the Algarve, close proximity to Albufeira if you like that type of town. Villa Mouira is just a short taxi also. Accommodation - we love the apartment area we normally reserve, close to a pool, with beautiful Portugese sunlight (normally) waking you up on your private terrace. That said the apartments are dated inside, but comfortable, spacious, superbly cleaned by good staff daily, attentive to any requests for missing items etc. We have always found the cleaning staff to be top class.Kids - now we only have one child so like many, our little lady is the most important part of any holiday. The Kids Club staff are simply fantastic. Marta, Jessica and the guys looked after our little lady every day for a little while (longer if you want to leave you child morning and afternoon but we only choose and hour or two in the morning). On our last trip this was the highlight of our holiday seeing our little angel so well cared for and taking part in their room based activities. This is all amazing. Now I do have to comment on the hotel making an investment to bring this facility into a more modern acceptable level - the room is very warm and the playground is very limited. I've read others reviews of this and agree the hotel needs to invest heavily here. You have the most fantastic staff, please make some investment in the facility. You have the best staff, now you need the best Kids Club area so we can all shout about it. Bar Atlantico - this is another reason we go to this resort. Its location between the hotel and the beach is stunning. Its also open to the public. Now versus last number of times we've been I have to say the standard of food has dropped, the staff are not as friendly as they used to be, with one exception. I am not concerned about staff but seriously disappointed in the quality of food for lunches.Hotel Food - we only used the hotel on one occassion, the last night for the buffet dinner. I really enjoyed it but as one other reviewer commented they have not mastered the art of keeping carvery style food warm. This is a concern but for me I really enjoyed the meal and inclusive drinks. Logistics - there is a superb free bus service to town running though the day and evening. Also the Front of House guys who manage luggage and drive you around in the buggies are great, always with a smile and very professional and courteous. There are some other aspects of this hotel that bug me - why in a 5 star hotel do you not have access to the indoor pool free of charge, as a paying guest? Happy Hour, now removed for no good reason? Look, I do love the Resort but I now face a dilemma - have we become too familiar with the GRSE, without having another 5 star resort to compare it against. I promise you this is a great place to vacation and with beautiful sunshine you can have a great time BUT versus UK&Ireland Hotels this would definitely only be a 4 star. So it comes down to Value for Money and thats all in what deal you choose !!"
Oct 2017,50,high quality hotel at the sea,"Grand hotel directly at the sea, nice beach. The rooms are big with nice balconies to the sea. Unfortunately the carpet is old and not clean, this could be better. The mattresses are very hard.Breakfast was great."
Oct 2017,50,40 years marriage,"maybe consider coffee in the room?location :on the beach. seavew: beautiful very kind crew spa great and massage gorgeouslocation: away from ,and yet not too far from town centermaybe suggest not to many dance partys near swimming pool?"
Oct 2017,40,Holiday,"Expensive holiday but hotel clean and staff friendly and polite. Very helpful on the reception desk. Carpet in the hotel room very tired and discoloured, bed comfortable. Buffet food not very hot, kept lukewarm. Relaxing break by the pool and very close to the beach. Shuttle bus useful as not much nearby."
Oct 2017,40,Good,More breakfast en dinner choise. The minibar is missing. The airconditioning could not handle.Service in restaurant was to late and food not to warm. With service Will hopefully be better.Otherwise the stay was very pleasant.
Oct 2017,50,a weeks holiday,"Had a great time here, nice, clean, excellent facilities and staff, the only niggle was the water pressure in the shower in my room, the rest of my stay was excellent.  I didn't want to leave. The beach and pool were excellent, the bars and restaurants were good with good service, I would stay here again."
Oct 2017,40,Half term Family Holiday,"Just come back from this hotel, we had a lovely stay! Hotel is very clean and staff are friendly.Location is amazing, direct access through a card controlled gate onto a brilliant beach for kids, snack bar/toilets close too!Pool area was nice shame not all the pools onsite were heated though.Restaurants were ok but a bit more variety would be good for evening meals as the buffet is expensive and doesn't really cater for kids and the burger restaurant is limited. Breakfast was great though! Loads of choice kids loved it! We were b&b so it suited us. New town is walkable lots of restaurants there, old town is easy to get to on the free hotel bus, although if your thinking it's a quaint old fishing town it's definitely not! Very similar to the new town!The self catering appartments are nice a bit dated but the internet access is poor and the TV channels weren't good, no English kids programmes or films, if you have to put kids to bed relatively early I would download some films to the iPad from Netflix before you go!!All in all a great family holiday, the weather was amazing! Pool good, beach brilliant! Food fine, rooms good, location great and the kids had a great time. Happily go back."
Oct 2017,50,Great Hotel,"Our most relaxed holiday so far. The hotel is big, clean and staff are all very friendly. Only one pool was heated which is a bit of a downer as it can be quite busy but the access to the beach was very handy and one of the reasons why we picked the hotel. The food we’ve had were all excellent. The view when having a drink or having a meal was fantastic. We will definitely go back again."
Oct 2017,30,Hotel nice ..... let down by the food,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights as part of Costa Del Folk.The hotel itself is very nice, clean, expansive, lovely beach, couple of nice bars and pleasing decor.We had a 1 bedroom apartment at the back of the hotel near the (very busy) main road — very comfortable, well equipped and spacious. The main road was not a problem for us as the windows were double glazed and kept shut. Air conditioning was effective and not intrusively noisy.The staff were largely quite pleasant and friendly .... although there were 1 or 2 exceptions .... particularly one or 2 of the dinner waiters were a bit surly and couldn’t be bothered with smiling or being pleasant.In our opinion the food let this hotel down badly ..... the cooked bacon at breakfast was inedible and the other ‘hot’ breakfast offerings were cold and uninviting. The bread and pastries were ok but nothing special— fruit juice was nice and the coffee hot and strong!The food at the dinner buffet was unimaginative, bland and with limited choices. Queuing for a table in a 5 star hotel is not on ..... we had to do this on 2 of our 3 evenings. The food was never ‘hot’ and I did worry a bit about food poisoning, but thankfully we had no problems with illness at all.On the positive side, the waiters were quite generous in refuelling our wine glasses when they ran low!!I expected more quality from a supposed 5 star hotel......we would not book this hotel ourselves for a holiday, but we would come back to the hotel for another Costa Del Folk if the performers suited us."
Oct 2017,30,We were in room 224 and it was ery narrow & not enough hanging spade in the wardrobe,"The rooms could with updating & should never be five star. The pool sinloungers should have mats on them as they are very uncomfortable. We travelled with Enjoy travel & was very disappointed with it all as we paid allot of money for our trip, I would not go back again"
Oct 2017,40,Short trip,The hotel was very nice; unfortunately we had very few time to exploit all its potential and also the season was not the best. Notwithstanding we had a very pleasant stay and we consider this property with a very high value for money
Oct 2017,50,Very relaxing family Hotel and apartments........perfect,"A great location with lots of swimming pools and a short walk to the beach. We stayed in a self catering apartment, these are a class and more above some of others we've stayed in. They were cleaned every day to a very high standard. The cleaning team deserve some high praise for their work.The hotel has good facilities, friendly and helpful staff. It was a perfect quiet location which is what we needed as a family."
Oct 2017,40,Very good but not 5 star,"I have stayed at this hotel previously and couldn't fault it before.... this time however I found the staff to be ""just doing their jobs"" they did not go out of their way to be friendly or helpful as on previous stays at the hotel. In general it is a fab hotel, very quiet and a bit out of the way on a lovely beach if you like that sort of holiday!!"
Oct 2017,50,Enjoyable Holiday- Would like to re-book a different apartment preferbably apt 508.,"Hi , i stayed in apartment 401,( a 1 bedroom apartment). I liked the apartment but i thought the wardrobe in the main bedroom was musty. Also the apartment was right beside the exit of the underground and there I was a bit of noise in and out.I would v much like to stay in the complex again but like the ground floor apartments no, 507 , 508 and 509 near the pool.I would be interested in 10 nights from the 23rd of July 2018. Can you confirm price and availability,We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at the hotelThanks,Mary Clinton"
Oct 2017,40,Little corner of calm and sparkling cleanliness,"Had a lovely 10 days here with caring, professional staff, and a beautiful, quiet room. The pool is fabulous (although I like it fresh!) and the breakfasts are good and wholesome if a little predictable.We were half board and found the dinners a bit uninspiring and weren’t very keen on eating in the basement every evening but overall we would recommend the Eulália. A lovely place for a relaxed holiday."
Oct 2017,50,Perfect venue for a wedding!,"We got married here on 21st May 2017, the day was perfect from start to finish. I wouldHighly recommend this venue for having a wedding abroad. Our guests could not praise the staff and food enough and said it’s the best food they have had at a wedding. We stayed for 3 nights in a suite which was lovely. Very spacious and clean. We also had a lovely surprise on our wedding night coming back to our room / bee decorated. Special thank you to Angela who was great from the day we met her right up to when we checked out of the hotel. Once again I really can not praise this hotel enough and would love to return for a holiday one day."
Oct 2017,30,Not quite five-star,"""iIt's just like a liner"" I overheard one visitor say as they walked into the double height reception area with sweeping staircase. And in many ways it was with large areas for dining and relaxing, a bar that opened out onto a (sun)deck, and in the main hotel long corridors off which the cabins (sorry, bedrooms, were placed. It also, as other reviewers have noted, has apartment buildings in pretty garden surroundings. Plus of course, swimming pools and a beach.Everything was more than adequate, but places could do with a bit of freshening-upand at times service was slow. There was always a good choice at the breakfast buffet, a tendency for some dishes to run out at dinner (also buffet). The food was pleasant enough, but nothing to get excited over. Fortunately with a fridge in our room we could supplement the bar service with items from the supermarket, although the cocktails were certainly worth the price.Probably, because it was the end of the season not all the cafes and bars were open, but the beach bar was a lovely place for lunch, with prompt service and freshly cooked food. Pity it wasn't open in the evenings.It's advertised a five star resort, in my view it only just reached four."
Oct 2017,40,Nice place just avoid cooked breakfast ,We stayed in one of the apartments which was very well setup for family use. The baby cots had mattresses and they left out smarties for the babies when we arrived 😊 which went down well. The staff where all very friendly and helpful. The place was really nice and there was plenty of space. The bed in the apartment was hard but really big. There is a free bus that goes several times a day to Albufeira old town and new town. Handy - but Uber is quicker and more flexible option 😉So lots of positives - however I spent most of the holidays with an upset tummy / being sick. Can only put it down to the fried breakfast - as both mornings I had it i was sick for day and the next day 🤢 my family stuck to the non fry option and they where all grand.  On reading some other trip advisor reviews from people who stayed at the same time as us they seem to have got the same tummy bug issue 🤔
Oct 2017,40,Grande Real Santa Review,"Very good resort for a family holiday. The pools were clean and good (although it would be nice to have another heated pool), the staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean and comfortable. Location was excellent and very close to the beach. Would happily stay again at the resort."
Oct 2017,50,Excellent,"Excellent hotel, good value and so close to the beach.  I was there for the folk music festival which was great fun and the hotel were very accommodating and perfect hosts from what I could tell.  I especially enjoyed the breakfast pastries!"
Oct 2017,40,Costa Del Folk 2017,"This is a bit of an odd review in that we were here for a folk festival and so that nearly everything we did was based on that premise.The travel company (Enjoy Travel) booked out most of the hotel to festival guests who either had an apartment in the grounds or a hotel room. I am personally glad we had an apartment as we had living space, a couple of tv's, a good sized bathroom, kitchen with fridge and microwave,air con (which stayed on when you left the apartment), easy to work safe and a massive (if a bit hard bed). There is a patio outside the room leading into a garden area.There was a pool and lounger area in our part of the complex (the bar and toilets not open during our stay). The west side formed part of the festival and so there was a stage set up there (bar and toilets open)The pools were all circular outside and either heated, seawater or chlorinated fresh (the latter 2 were really cold!!!The heated pool and seawater pool were between the hotel and the beach and this was another area of the festival where another stage was set up. Meals were taken in this area (we were on half board basis and so breakfast and evening meals were taken either inside or outside (it was unseasonable warm during our stay).Everything was key carded in the complex, so you could access the beach (through gates) and the same card used for your room or to leave the complex to visit the small supermarket 5 minutes up the road (under a hotel) or 20 minutes walk to a larger supermarket.We also used large conference rooms for the folk club (late night music) and for the main music auditorium where evening performances were held.There is a spa here with a large internal pool but we didn't use it.The hotel provides a bus (for us anyway, so you will have to check with the hotel to see if this the case normally) to visit Albufeira but we didn't use the service.I only have one gripe here and that I got a bad stomach here (it just made me feel really sick on the last day (I passed out on the plane home) and for the next 5 days when we returned home - my girlfriend didn't get it but she ate different things to me at breakfast and evening meal. Other people came down with similar complaints to me either while they were there or the day they arrived home. The meals were served under hot plates inside and in steel serving tureens outside. I can imagine that mass catering at hotels is full of problems in that the food has to stay safe to eat for 3 to 4 hours a day and it only takes one dish to make people ill. The drinks prices are standard for a 5 star hotel anywhere, in that beer was about 3.5 euros and spirits 4.5 euros. The unfair bit was that the hotel charged 2.5 euros for a glass of soft drinks or a splash, making a vodka and coke 7 euros - a bit of a rip off and people learned quickly not to order spirits from the bar.The staff here made us feel welcome and the ones we met were friendly with a good standard of English. We are looking forward to visiting this festival next year - hopefully with the same great weather."
Oct 2017,50,Excellent all round,Excellent hotel and facilities with free coach pick-up to the old and new town and back.  Food is excellent and so is the staff.  Very clean and spacious bedrooms and the restaurant facilities are very good with a wide choice of food.
Oct 2017,40,A week long stay for Costa del Folk,"This hotel was excellent on so many levels: cleanliness, facilities, comfy beds, good service and lovely views. Sadly, the well cooked and great choice of food served in the buffet restaurant at breakfast and dinner was ruined by the failure to keep it even vaguely warm. This obviously spoiled our enjoyment and also caused us to worry about how safe it was to eat. We noted the lamps above the food were LED - this would not help. If the hotel could address this very fundamental problem, it would deserve a very high rating. We specially enjoyed the access to the beach, the saltwater pool and the nearby Fatima bakery!"
Oct 2017,50,A wonderful experience.,The hotel was beautiful and the staff were very kind and helpful.My stay at your hotel was a wonderful experience and I look forward to returning in the future.The hotel ground's were well maintained and the hotel was spotless.
Oct 2017,50,Great hotel,"Excellent location( right on the beach), great service and the staff were very helpful. My wife is gluten and dairy intolerant and the staff did everything to accommodate her needs. Very happy with our stay, will definitely be back."
Oct 2017,50,Can't wait to come back,"We came for Costa del Folk and everything about the hotel was excellent.  The room was air-conditioned and very comfortable.  Breakfast and dinner were both excellent with plenty of choices.  Above all, the staff were all cheerful and helpful."
Oct 2017,50,Costa del Folk 2017 festival held at this hotel 9-15 October,"Fabulous holiday, one of our best ever. The festival was the main reason for going but everything worked wonderfully - flights, hotel, food and the festival. We had an apartment in the hotel grounds which was excellent and well equipped. Although we were on breakfast and dinner basis we could use the kitchenette facilities for tea and snacks whenever we wanted. The grounds were lovely and we had a pool near us that was virtually unused, like having a massive private pool. The staff were all very good and the buffet breakfast and dinner were both excellent. A very good hotel that I would be happy to recommend."
Oct 2017,50,Beautiful hotel in beautiful surrounding,Stayed here as part of the Costa del Folk festival. It was excellent all round. Food cleanliness and courtesy bus into old town. The pool area and grounds are lovely and right beside the beach. Different restaurants to suit different tastes and a lovely children’s play area. The balcony was large and private. The room furnishings were on the worn side but clean.
Oct 2017,20,Not a five star  Hotel !,"Stayed at this hotel for one week on a half board basis. Firstly and the only positives is the location and it is on the beach but you do have to pay E15 per day for sun beds for two people . The food at this hotel is below average and definitely not even four star standard. No Fresh grill area which you would expect.Buffet restaurant limited and  food constantly cold and when we complained we were offered to get it microwaved and subsequently we asked to speak to management but they didn’t seem to care and didn’t even offer a complimentary drink. Customer service or customer care not a priority at this hotel. Lunch time menu very limited and again food was cold . We ended up eating outside hotel for most of our trip in some very nice local restaurants. Rooms are old fashioned and in need of refurbishment. We did upgrade to seaview for the last four days for a cost of E120. Rooms have carpets which are stained and dirty.There was a Folk music tour staying at the hotel while we were there but apart from whatever music run by this tour group, entertainment at the hotel is non existent. Have stayed in many good hotels in Portugal and this is probably the worst for restaurant options and customer service.Very disappointing and we definitely do not recommend and would not return."
Oct 2017,50,Special Holiday for a Special Occasion,"Booked hotel for my wife's birthday and our 30th wedding anniversary. From the second we entered the hotel we had a 5 star time. The reception staff where so helpful and attentive giving us all the information we could possibly need. We had booked a suite with sea view and we were blown away with the rooms when we entered. For us it had everything we needed and more. On our first night after arriving late we had walked down to Martins just down the road to have one of the worst experiences we have ever had in a restaurant. We arrived to a half full place and be told they would see to us in a minute. 10 mins later after watching waiters running around looking busy to be told if we were looking to eat it would be 40mins wait!!!! Our experience lead us back to the hotel and onto the terrace to eat at the burger restaurant. Totally different experience. Treated so well and the food we had was first class served by lovely staff,Sleeping was great in a really large comfortable bed with no noise at all. Everything you need is provided in the bathroom. Also there is free use of a safe in the room.Breakfast for us was a really enjoyable time, Met every morning by pleasant staff who always had a smile. It was also great to have breakfast round the pool. Again for us there was a great amount to choose from and Prosecco provided every morning was a lovely touch. We spent our week on the beach  connected to the Hotel, Although when we stayed you could have got a sunbed at midday round the pool no problem, No people at 6 am putting towels on beds. The hotel provide you with Beach towels free of charge everyday which again is great also. You have to use your room key to get onto beach from Hotel and back in again.On the night of my wife's birthday we came back to our room to be met with a birthday cake and a bottle of Sparkly wine. It was a very unexpected surprise and we here both so pleased with the kindness.For us the holiday from the first second to the last was a 5 star experience. It will be a holiday we will not forget . Thank you to every member of staff in the hotel for making our holiday special."
Oct 2017,50,Costa Del folk week,"Good music,good company,good service. Air conditioning was good in the room.(248). The bed was comfortable. The food was very good,although I didn't care for the bacon and sausages in the morning. However there was plenty of choice. A healthier option was chosen. An all round wonderful experience."
Oct 2017,40,R Turner,Overall hotel was let down by the food.Hot food needs to be hot and late dinners need to be as good as early dinners.Have 2 queues for the dinning room - one for outside dining and 1 for inside dining.Have an egg chef for breakfast.We stay a lot in the Riu Hotels - their food experience is better than this hotel.
Oct 2017,50,"Good location, good service","We stayed here to attend a folk festival.  Rooms were comfortable although we found the air conditioning a bit problematic.  Restaurant staff were excellent, food, even though they were mass-catering via a buffet, was great.  There's a good beach attached the hotel."
Oct 2017,50,Amazing holiday,"Stayed here for 6 days with Costa del Folk. Hotel was fantastic. Beautiful rooms and great food.  Highlight was a heated outdoor pool, such luxury.  Free bus service into town also a great addition to the holiday. Really wonderful, we will return."
Oct 2017,40,Beautiful venue,"There were one or two issues (paint peeling off the wall of the apartment, phone not working, hot water not working, but these were dealt with very quickly and efficiently. The venue was located in a beautiful area and  we appreciated the transport into the nearby town. Everyone was welcoming and friendly."
Oct 2017,40,Ticks Most Of The Boxes!,"A nice hotel in a great location. A four star rather than a five in my opinion. Whilst the public areas of the hotel are smart and in a good condition, the room we stayed in was clearly in need of refurbishment. Our garden view apartment was last decorated many years ago (in garish colours)  and we didn't use the air con as it smelt so badly when it was switched on (an awful 'damp' smell). We loved the swimming pools, especially the heated pool, and there were plenty of sunbeds. The staff were good, except the older wine waiters, who studiously avoided our table most evenings. In the restaurant the food was OK, buffet style, but we weren't keen on sharing tables with other guests during busy times (anti social people like us should avoid eating at peak times!)."
Oct 2017,50,Costa del Folk Festival - Portugal 2017,Brilliant location for the festival. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and the free wine at dinner was a great bonus. Looking forward to returning to this hotel for Costa del Folk - Portugal 2018 in October next year
Oct 2017,50,Great Experience,"Stayed here for Costa Del Folk 2017. Provided a near-perfect venue for this event with excellent locations both indoors and out. They coped very well with the mass catering (although 'hot' food was sometimes fairly cold, even just having been served)."
Oct 2017,50,Costa del Folk,Enjoyed a great weekend of folk music here. Fabulous hotel with great service and lots of room to relax. The variety of pools and open spaces offered opportunities to be part of a crowd or to seek out somewhere quieter.
Oct 2017,50,Excellent Costa del Folk Location,"We stayed at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia for the 2017 Costa Del Folk festival and had a great time! The hotel is luxuriously equipped, with wonderful rooms, extensive restaurant options and friendly staff. It was a superb location for the Costa Del Folk festival and has already been booked again for the festival next year."
Oct 2017,50,Package stay for a folk festival,"Excellent choice for this type of event. Probably the best venue chosen by Enjoy Travel for their Costa Del Folk holidays, but would also be a good choice for a couples or family holiday without the added benefit of the folk music."
Oct 2017,40,Costa Del Folk,Great location for the festival! A lovely hotel with access to a great beach. The room was very comfortable and well serviced. It would have been better if tea and coffee making equipment had been provided.  Only minor gripe was the lack of choice of food for vegetarians at the main meal.
Oct 2017,50,Lovely stay,"We stayed for 6 nights with Costa del Folk in an apartment - half board. Staff were exceptional and the apartment was very well serviced every day. Good beds, shower, blackout curtains. Plenty of space for relaxation in the hotel lobby areas and outside terraces. Overlooks a gorgeous beach. Spa with gym machines and pool.Breakfast and dinner buffets were good, food could have been hotter.We had a great week and will be returning."
Oct 2017,40,"Friendly staff, wonderful location, fabulous breakfast","Really great stay here, lovely location, spotless, friendly staff, great choice at breakfast, it would be even better with a greater range of non-meat and fish options at dinner time. Lovely pool areas, wifi was mostly good but a little patchy in the mornings. Helpful staff, good free bus service into the old town. Firm bed, lovely beach area."
Oct 2017,50,Highly recomended,My husband and I stayed there for a week with the Paul Claffey tour. It was our 4th time staying here with our friends. Staff in hotel were excellent. We were well looked after. Music and entertainment were top class.
Oct 2017,50,FUN IN THE SUN,"Had fab stay in hotel.  Was on Paul Claffey Country Music Week.   Staff and hotel were great.  stayed in apartments, and had hotel provided a  buggy, to get us back to apartment.   First time visiting hotel, but going back next year."
Oct 2017,50,Costa Del Folk,The Jigantics playing Costa Del Folk and we were looked after very well.The hotel definitely deserves its 5 star rating. Food excellent and the location to the beach is really easy to get to. Very clean and lovely to walk along. Hope we are back sometime
Oct 2017,20,Dancing @ music ,"Great to be back in ireland after one week in this hotel it was very poor for a 5star the bed was just a wooden box with mattress  on top ,The smell in room of damp ?.the carpets was dirty stains very bad , Breafast was poor not hot at eny time ,we did not eat at the evening as we had a look at it and we was not impressed so we had meal at night out , sorry to say we will not be returning we have been on the music weeks with Paul claffey tours for years this is the worst hotel every sorry to say"
Oct 2017,40,Event Week,"Very nice hotel, unfortunately their main restaurants had closed for the season so we had to eat out in the evenings after our week of entertainment. If we'd known this prior to booking we wouldn't have stayed so long and just taken the advertised 1 week trip with Paul Claffey tours."
Oct 2017,50,Holiday )ct 2017,"We really enjoyed our stay with your hotel. It is our third year. Check in was superb this year and the rooms were ready when we arrived. I have to say your staff are excellent, friendly and most of all trust worthy, which is something I like. We will be back."
Oct 2017,50,Wonderful holiday,"Fabulous apartment, very spacious for the two of us. Well maintained. The resort grounds are lovely and you feel straight at home.The staff are so helpful nothing is too much problem.Will be going back there no doubt about it!"
Oct 2017,50,Fairy hill,"Stayed here for 8 days. Excellent staff,  friendly, courteous  and hardworking. Rooms very spacious.  Food and service excellent. Variety of places to eat all with great views and within walking distance to beach for early morning walks.  Would highly recommend this hotel"
Oct 2017,30,Certainly not 5 star,"Staying here for Costa Del Folk run by Enjoy Travel who are a fantastic company and well done to them for sorting out flights after the collapse of Monarch Airlines. They are fantastic at the festival and can't fault their service.  None of these comments are directed at Enjoy but at the hotel, Room spacious and great sea view but don't really like carpet in a hot country and the carpet is dirty and stained and the shower is pretty rubbish.Not 5 star.  Breakfast is OK but no egg chef for omelettes etc; which you normally get in Portugal or Spain in a 3 star; unbelievable in 5 star! Typical buffet dinner but 1st night in the inside restaurant food was cold and no live cooking which is normal in a 3 or 4 star.Unexpected bonus was free drinks with dinner, alcoholic or not and the waiters were very good serving us water, wine and beer. Next night managed to get an outside table and the food in the containers was much hotter. But.... the tall waiter who seemed to be in charge was awful and seemed to resent people getting drinks either soft or alcoholic. It was busy and many people were asking for drinks so it made sense to to give them a decent measure I asked for ages for water and when he finally came I got a third of  a small glass and small wine.  Because it took so long to get a drink I asked for a larger glass of wine and water but he said I had to finish the one I had first. We finished our mains and on asking for another drink he asked if we had finished eating as if he couldn't serve us: we had.'t even gone for deserts!! Other people were also trying to get a drink without success!! The other waiter was giving people decent glasses of wine and water!! This waiter's attitude made me feel very uncomfortable and quite upset when I left especially when the rest of the hotel staff have been fantastic and very helpful Also I have never ever been in a hotel (especially 5 star) that doesn't have ice cream at dinner. I live in Spain and often saty in hotels and ice cream is standard in a 3 star hotel."
Oct 2017,50,Dream come through,"Our stay at the Grande Real Sante Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa was a dream come beginning to end, from the Staff, Service, Accommodation, Food, Comfort Location to Location. I highly recommend the Hotel and will definitely be back for out fifth visit soon."
Oct 2017,40,Hooley in the sun  first time visit,Amazing hotel  very clean  well run  Top marks to the cleaning staff  who came to our apartments   Really polite  and courteous 👏👏Bad lay out for breakfast ...toaster in wrong place which caused  big delays Food  some times looked tired and like it had layed there for hours
Oct 2017,50,Paul Claffey Music Tour.,"My stay was excellent. From arriving, reception staff friendly&helpful. Food great, suggest omelettes by Carla for breakfast superb. Function room & jiggy jiggy staff interaction with guests fantastic. Overall top marks for service given to all 700 guests. You deserve a Gold star!"
Oct 2017,50,Great for babies,"We have 8 month twins , cots were there ready. We had a room on ground floor close to the pool with everything we needed! Staff were lovely and really made effort! Would recomend to anyone with children! Lovely clean pool and enough shade to keep babies out of sun"
Oct 2017,50,Great stay,We had a great stay here. With our 1 yr old daughter. Great apartments and good service. Spectacular beach front  Nothing but praise for this place and great value for money. Surely recommend this place for families.
Oct 2017,50,Very nice hotel,Hotel was really nice and would definitely return.. was near the strip of bars and then just a short bus ride to the old town which is really nice! my only comment would be that the spa treatment prices are a bit too much.. other than that really nice hotel!
Oct 2017,40,Lovely hotel . Large and abs spotless,Beautiful hotel and service great. Food at breakfast was abs fine. Super clean pool areas and all areas of hotel. Bar was a bit expensive... Courtesy bus to Albufeira got full very quickly leaving people with babies to hire a taxi. The bus could have ran throughout the day.
Oct 2017,50,Week in the Algarve ,"We stayed in the Algarve for one week at this fabulous resort. Initially we thought to use it as a base from which to explore Portugal's sunny southern region. The resort was so lovely we ended up spending 3 days lounging around the pool, walking the beach and getting some rest and relaxation. The resort is centrally located, so day trips to the interior, Faro and Sagres were easy to do. We did have our own rental car, but there were many tours to choose from. The staff were warm and welcoming. Never intrusive but very helpful if you requested something. The hotel was very clean, beds were comfortable and the rooms were generously proportioned. We had a lovely patio outside our room which was great to sit out and enjoy a drink. We did have a view of the ocean but it was partially obstructed. Booking rooms in the upper floors is recommended if that is important to you.We ate at the restaurants (there are four) on site and the food and service was very good. We would have preferred more selection for dinner options as there were only two restaurants open for dinner, but going into Albufeira was not a problem and there was much to choose from in town."
Oct 2017,40,very nice property on an amazing beach,"Spent 5 nights at this hotel in late September.  The rooms was nice with a balcony, and fridge, though would have preferred a sea view.  Very clean and modern, though how about replacing the carpets with a hard surface flooring??..Courteous service including chocolate on bed each day!  Buffet breakfast and buffet dinner very good with lots of selection.  Pools and deck great for sunbathing.  Beach is long and sandy with chairs and umbrellas to rent.  Water in the ocean was cold but still swimable.  High red cliffs surround the beach.  Enjoyed the spa for a massage.  Grounds were well kept on the whole, but the front of the hotel could use some gardening tlc as lots of weeds.  The adjacent apartments had grounds that were very well groomed etc.  The food in the bar restaurant was uninspired and actuallybelow standard in terms of presentation and taste. it's hard to go wrong with natchos and a burger but they managed to do so.."
Oct 2017,50,Fantastic resort,"Great hotel, thoroughly enjoyed our stay, fantastic location, with stunning views & direct access to beach. great restaurants, fish restaurant with open fire grill was amazing although a little pricey. Superb buffet breakfast"
Oct 2017,30,Room for improvement,"A lot of room for improvement, especially considering this hotel has a5-star rating.Facilities and location were very good.Excellent breakfast choice and quality.Staff appeared demotivated and they lack training. A lot of them seemed unhappy and it was hard to get a smile or even a greeting. More understanding towards children and their needs.Entertaining should be more consistent and more variety (a few nights the performances were cancelled and games rooms closed even though we were there in Sep).Dinner must improve, considering this hotel is 5* and price paid.Apartment was spacious and comfortable, although it needs a bit of TLC and updating."
Oct 2017,50,Fabulous resort,"We stayed end of September , staff and hotel was fantastic  near a beautiful beach , breakfasts were superb,  lovely room with a beautiful sea .The weather was beautiful throughout our holiday .Would definitely return to Grande Real .Thank  you for everything"
Oct 2017,50,Fabulous Mini break with friends,Just had a wonderful few days here with friends. The weather was perfect. The position of the hotel is wonderful right on the beach. We stayed bed and breakfast  .The breakfast was great. Everything you could want. Even cava. Hotel is spotlessly clean  and the staff are charming. We will be back. Thankyou
Oct 2017,50,Excellent family hotel with everything you need.,"This hotel was perfect for our first family holiday. We had a studio apartment which had everything we needed & had breakfast in the hotel which was excellent. Staff are so friendly & helpful. The lady that cleaned our room was so nice & was so mindful of waking the baby! Our room was overlooking the pool area but we used the pools at the main hotel as one if them is heated. Great atmosphere, lots of families. We did eat in the burger restaurant which was nice but you pay a little bit more however the terrace is lovely with beautiful views out to sea. Would recommend & would like to stay again in this lovely hotel!"
Oct 2017,50,Beautiful hotel and great staff,"My husband and I stayed for 10 nights and 10 very relaxing days. From the moment we arrived the staff were very friendly and welcoming. Our room was perfect, clean and we loved the blackout curtains, normally we are up from 6am, but some mornings on holiday it was 8 due to quietness and comfort. Breakfast was fantastic everyday, but we were not so keen when the staff started to direct you to a table, to avoid this and the queue do get down early. The poolside is brilliant and so peaceful with fantastic views over the beach/sea. We were delighted with the additional towels that the hotel supplied and really appreciated that you collect a fresh one daily.We found now faults at GRSE and will definitely return, only thing I would recommend is to take your own transfer,our bus took 1hr20 mins"
Oct 2017,40,Based on a B &B stay in an apartment in the hotel grounds.,Apartments were very clean and well kitted out but not quite in the same 5 star class as the main hotel. A quiete location away from the main centre of Albufeira with a lovely beach and lots of on site facilities. Family friendly. Buffet breakfast very good with large selection. Evening buffet worth a try but plenty of other restaurants in Albufeira .Be prepared to use taxis or hire car as shuttle bus to / from Albufeira does not run into late evening.
Oct 2017,50,hotel,"hotel was lovely. however would have liked tea/coffee facilities in the room. also in the washrooms downstairs the mens hand dryers were not working, would have liked a clock by the pool. liked  the fact there was a bus that took us into town and was plenty of resteurants to choose from. likes the pool although one of the pools was very cold"
Oct 2017,50,Faultless,"Been here before, the hotel is faultless, great with kids , the manager sorts any problems straight away.  The staff are so friendly and helpful.  The guys on the beach with the Jet Skis were great with my 23month old helping him on with his dad."
Oct 2017,50,A fantastic holiday experience,First impressions were very good. A pleasant and informative welcome from the reception staff which included an offer of an upgrade on our booked accommodation. The accommodation was first class with the garden terrace opening out  towards the swimming pool.  The daily room service was excellent and is to be commended. We thoroughly enjoyed this our first holiday at the Grand Real Santa Eulalia which will not be our last
Oct 2017,50,Excellent hotel,"The reception and all staff were top class, plenty sun beds , food was excellence   especially the restaurant served lunches, the only down side was the evening and day time entertainer which was not worth watching  one evening there was 6 guests watching the  ""show ""out of maybe 200 guests.stayingthe shuttle bus to the town worked well.Would we go back certainly"
Oct 2017,50,What a view,"This is an ideal location to stay. Just outside Oura. Fantastic staff, rooms, food, views. We are going back. A short walk down the steps to the lovely beach. The pool area was very clean and they had a nice bar service."
Oct 2017,50,Hotel Review,"We have had a wonderful time at the hotel and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Enjoyed the rooms, the food, the location, the beach, the spar, the bars, the reception guys for all their help and Of course, the free shuttle service to the old town!!"
Oct 2017,20,"Poor Customer Service, Over priced accomodations, Unfortunate Beach Management","I stayed here with my wife for our honeymoon.  The compound itself was nice, however not a single staff member showed an ounce of care when handling our questions, requests, etc.  Specifically, one member of the staff at the beach bar rolled her eyes at us every time we made a request.  I asked her for a simple bag of ice and she acted like I was insulting her.  She couldnt be bothered.  The food was poor at best, and way over priced.  Additionally, it was unfortunate that your hotel does not manage the beach and chairs.  To pay 15 euros simply to sit on a chair is outrageous.  This may be customary, however, we felt that our experience was hampered by the fact we were giving money away just to sit on a beach chair.The towel card policy is stupid, when the live music would be cancelled there was no notification.  Shuttles were cancelled with notification only in the form of a small sign at the front desk.  How would I know a shuttle is cancelled if I didnt go to the desk to find out?  The shuttles should have run later than 720pm.  This is just a scam to partner with cabs and make money for them.  The staff would only provide recommendations that were located in Old Town and New Town.  As someone who travelled very far for a good experience, I would have hoped that your staff would offer some options outside of the tourist trap where every single restaurant had the same exact bland menu and overly aggressive staffers pulling you into their restaurant.Lastly, and while not a major issue but would have been nice, your staff could care less that we were on honeymoon.  We shared this with multiple staffers in the hopes that maybe they would stop treating us so poorly, but not one person cared about that.Outside of the location which I believed through my research was good(and now dont believe so knowing that I would not want to go to old town and new town ever again) I would not recommend this hotel based on the above as well as some additional frustrations.Paying to sit on a beach on our honeymoon and being treated poorly by your staff were primary concerns, but only one layer of issues."
Oct 2017,50,Amazing Resort with excellent Beach,Stayed at the Grande Real apartments for 5 days last week and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The location was perfect and the beach was just a short walk from the rooms. Always managed to find a decent spot in the beach no matter what time of the day we went. The apartment was cleaned everyday during our stay which was very nice. We arrived a bit late for the check-in but faced no problems as it was all ready for us when we came in. Got a free late check out as well (until about 2.30pm) which was a life saver as the little one wanted to take a nap that afternoon! There is still room for improvement though - Kids Club - even though the temperature was decent (mid 20's) it was quite warm inside the club. With the sun beating down on the play area it would have been helpful to have the inside more cooler. In fact considering the place gets an average of 3000 hours of sun shine a year it would be good if the management can put some sort of cover for the play ground to help the children through the heat. Swimming pools - probably due to the low season it was not very full. Most of the crowd inside the pool were with kids and all of them used the heated pool. It might be a good idea to have all the kids pool heated too. Used room service once and was good. But there are lots of restaurants nearby if you wish to fancy them. Also it would be good if they changed the decor of the apartments and made sure the curtains covered the windows well and let very minimal light through. Had to use a dustbin to hold the curtains in the bedroom in place so it would cover the entire window!Will certainly return if we wanted to go to Algarve again but would advise against visiting during the peak season as I am sure the pool will be quite crowded.
Oct 2017,30,Definitely not 5-star quality,"I guess it's a nice hotel for families but I would certainly give it a miss if you are friends or couples. It definitely isn't a 5-star quality hotel. It might tick the boxes for the things you need to have to be a 5-star hotel, but it definitely lacked the 5-star mentality. Pools are small and there are A LOT OF KIDS!! We went in Sept and they had closed the bar/resto at the other pool area because it was out of season... although the hotel was booked out?!The mattress cover has a plastic coating and was MOST uncomfortable. Every time you moved you could hear the plastic rustling. I've NEVER had that in a hotel before, let alone a 5-star one!!!You are only allowed one towel per person. What's THAT all about?!?No concierge - 5-star?!?!?!Staff weren't overly helpful in recommendations. Food was OK... food for the massesLocation was a bit out of town, which was good for me because town is a little crazy. Only 8-10 euros (including tip) taxi ride.Overall I felt like a number. The hotel was just a place to lay my head."
Oct 2017,50,Idyllic hotel and location,"From start to finish we enjoyed a wonderful holiday here. Service, location, food, ambience.....everything was wonderful. Go for a room overlooking the sea if you can. Beach was lovely and never crowded. Would recommend Atlantico Restaurant and bar overlooking the beach. The only negative things I could say was that our bed was extremely hard but that's personal preference and that all the bars and restaurants including Le Club weren't open during our stay but this did not detract from our enjoyment. Will definitely be returning."
Oct 2017,50,Fantastic,Our stay at GRSE was as fantastic as ever. We have been coming here for the last 6 years and also got married in the hotel and our expectations have never failed! We had our 2 children with us (2& 7 months) and it was so well equipped for them also.  The only thing I might recommend that the rooms are a bit dated(never dirty) interior wise and they could do with an overhaul and also it would be very handy to have washing machine facilities at apartments side!
Oct 2017,40,Very nice stay,"Very nice and pleasant stay at the Grand Real Santa Eulalia last week. The hotel is very clean and by all accounts is very well run, at no point did we have any issues or see any guests having issues with anything. For a five star it's a bit disappointing there wasn't a tea and coffee service in the room, as we would have enjoyed sitting out on our balcony in the mornings just enjoying a coffee in the sun on our own. I would also say that we would have spent more money there on drinks but they are prohibitively expensive - €60 for a bottle of Portuguese prosecco which can be purchased for €12 in the shop around the corner is just excessive; had that been €25-30 we would have more than happy to buy them. So I felt that the high level of profiteering does sour what is a very nice and well run hotel."
Oct 2017,50,great location ☺,Great location with excellent staff service...highly recommend this hotel if one is looking for beach and relaxation.  Beautiful pool facilities and many restaurants to choose from as well with amazing views👍
Oct 2017,40,Good Location for Beach,"The hotel staff were pleasant from the moment we arrived & I certainly have nothing to complain about in this department. The pool areas were satisfactory however I am sure in peak season these would become very overcrowded & securing a sunbed in a hotel this size would be challenging to say the least... but at this time (late September) all was fine. The same issue could probably be expected of the beautiful Beach in peak season as it is a massive hotel with apartments also on site and there is a fair amount of other apartments also using this rather small area. A couple of nice reasonably priced restaurants are on site & the food was very nice. Although there is a bar on site it really is just an area in the foyer/lobby where you can sit and have a drink; service isn't great here even when only a handful of people are drinking. I think there is a club between the hotel & the beach but I only saw it in use for a wedding party; maybe it is open for guests at peak times only? The room was fine, clean but dated/tired... as was the bathroom; small balcony overlooking the sea; I recommend a sea view as the alternative is overlooking the carpark! The main reason for booking this time of year was to hopefully minimise the number of kids at the hotel; unfortunately it seems this location also attracts a number of holiday makers that bring their pre-3 year old children away with them and that can make the whole pool and dining experience feel like you have booked your vacation at a pre-school nursery! This is course is not complaint of the hotel whatsoever; although it will never cease to baffle me why people think it is a good idea to bring babies on foreign holidays; it can't be pleasant for the kids just as it isn't pleasant for everyone else at the resort or on the plane! At least there is the Beach to escape to for peace. Anyway all in all a pleasant stay but as I say the lounging area can't possibly be a pleasant experience in the peak season; but you can read other reviews to get a better picture of that."
Oct 2017,50,Short holiday late summer,"Hotel is beautiful, has everything you could wish for, staff are extremely courteous and professional, very clean, well maintained fantastic setting.  Fabulous beach, wonderful spa, good value for money,"
Oct 2017,50,Fantastic holiday..everything you could want from sun holiday..hotel was first class..so helpful..pleasant.. cheerful..,Fantastic holiday..hotel was excellent.. so helpful..pleasant staff..everything you could possibly want from sun holiday..every need was taken care of..food divine..had a wonderful surprise birthday cake..
Oct 2017,50,Brilhante,"Fabulous hotel, family friendly, beautiful views, excellent service, very clean and comfortable. Fantastic facilities  and lovely friendly helpful staff. Only downside was the gym didn't have much variety in equipment. A member of our party had a birthday and when they arrived back to their room in the evening they found a birthday cake and champagne waiting for them, which I thought was a beautiful gesture it really made her day! Well done to all involved in the running of this fantastic hotel. We will definitely be back. Obrigado"
Oct 2017,50,Couples Break,"My girlfriend and I went for a couples break for a week. We arrived at in ideal time where the hotel wasn't too busy.When we were checked in, knowing that language would cause an issue from time to time, we received a lot of information about  the hotel, its facilities and what was included for us. It was very smooth and speedy. The staff are very kind, they helped us with our luggage, showed us around the room, directed us to different parts of the hotel and the town. Check out was just as smooth and simple.Apologies to housekeeping as we were in the room everyday when they tried to clean it but they were very prompt, patient, friendly and they did a great job on each day of our stay.The spa was what drew us the most to stay here. It is absolutely beautiful. We were lucky enough to pretty much have the whole spa to ourselves on one day and we made full use of the pool, steam room and sauna. When it was time for our treatment one of the masseuses or masseurs greet you and escort you to your room where they really do take care of you in a highly professional manor. There is no way you can not relax and/or if you're someone like me fall asleep a few times.When it came to dinner we were a bit spoiled for choice with three restaurants to choose from. Each restaurant has a different menu and the main restaurant has a different buffet on each night so there's something for pretty much everyone. The food itself was delicious and very filling.Breakfast time was what I was looking forward to the most, waking up to temperatures of at least 20 degrees, on all days except one with clear skies and the opportunity to eat in the sun. Although I couldn't have a bit of everything I very much enjoyed what I could have.The hotel offers actives such as tennis, surfing, paint balling, live music, surfing etc. and some of which are free. There's also a shuttle that could bring you to the old town where there's a bit of a historical feel or the new town with all the bars, clubs and more stores and whatnot. No matter what you can always find something to do.The location is amazing with a beautiful view of the ocean. you can enjoy it from the three outdoor pools or from the beach. It doesn't get better than tanning in the sun then cooling off in the open waters.I'm sorry I can't remember all your names but a big thank you from the both of us to everyone for making our stay unforgettable. We will be returning at some point."
Sep 2017,50,simply fantastic,"Wonderful landscape, fantastic location, Weather has been very good, many possibilities for sports and ventures, nice to hike at the seaside, wunderful sunset over the sea, very friendly people, very good natural food - everythings fine - almost like a dream!"
Sep 2017,50,happy place,"we enjoyed our week here , think its more for family's would recommend .Breakfast and Lunch was lovely and excellent food the evening buffet was not so well run we did not enjoy the rush that  seem to go on."
Sep 2017,30,"Beautiful grounds, Disappointed with rooms","My husband and I choose to stay at this hotel as we are due to get married and thought it would be nice to stay in a 5* hotel as a treat. The grounds around the hotel are beautiful with lots of amenities. Access to the beach is fab, though you still have to pay for hire of the sun loungers. We paid to stay in a suite but the room was certainly not 5* the rooms are in desperate need of some TLC. There were loose plug sockets in the room, the smell of sewerage coming from the loo's was disgusting! The carpets were grubby and the bathrooms are disgusting. Some of the male staff who help with your baggage were not very friendly or pleasant! I think giving the above I would not say this was 5* I have stayed in some 4* hotels that have been nicer. If they put some money into the Decor and cleaning the rooms it would be more appealing."
Sep 2017,40,Albufeira beach stay,"A fantastic beach stay .  Lovely studio apartments close to old and new town..stunning small beach, very nice pool area...water in pools to cold though.   Very expensive to eat at the hotel so bought groceries and ate in town every evening"
Sep 2017,50,Lovely place,"Lovely place, quiet with easy beach access and short walk to supermarkets, restaurants etc. Great for families with a friendly atmosphere. The free shuttle bus also means it's easy to get to the old town to explore!"
Sep 2017,50,Great hotel,The staff were very helpful and courteous. Hotel shuttle was a plus. I was able to book Paddleboard trip through the hotel and staff was great. We had a great view of the gardens and the ocean and room was spacious.
Sep 2017,40,Could have done better Bryn Hawkins Wales,We felt that the hospitality transport should run later it stopped at 18/20 on our second week and night time entertainment at the hotel was poor and turn up one night I am sure if they tried a replament could have been found this was on a Saturday night not happy also no facilities for the people in the apartments a little shop for basics would be something this is a 5Star complex a bottle of water not much use to make a coffee awggg x
Sep 2017,30,Satisfactory ,"Very friendly and helpful staff, were told we had been given a free upgrade so I wonder what we had originally!! Rooms ok, fairly clean and basic, beds hard and uncomfortable, tried one night on the pull out bed and it smelt damp, my partner gave up and went back to the two single beds pushed together, our first holiday together in a 5star hotel but I wouldn't say it was worth the money, free shuttle service to old town which was very helpful, too crowded around pools where unless you got there at stupid o clock you wouldn't get a bed, beach area lovely, beautiful part of Portugal but I wouldn't go back to that hotel, it didn't seem full to capacity so we could of been offered a room closer to the hotel, didn't use any of the spa treatments as they were too expensive, a shame but Portugal brilliant"
Sep 2017,40,Really lovely stay!,"My bf and I stayed a week and had a really lovely stay! Positives:- Hotel staff were very helpful and friendly and were very efficient. We asked for an iron and it was in our apartment by the time we returned. - The free shuttle bus into the Old Town was so handy! It's not an expensive journey by taxi but the bus is very convenient. Just be sure to get to the queue early for the last couple of buses.- The burger restaurant is great! Beautiful views and the food is really good and decent price too. - The location is perfect. Turn left out of the resort and you're a 5-10 minute walk into a little town with some nice restaurants and convenience stores. Portobellos pizzeria is also great and is opposite the resort.- The beach is on the doorstep of the resort. Easy access to a nice decent beach that's not too overcrowded. Beach towels are also supplied by the hotel which is great.- The apartment swimming pool wasn't busy and so peaceful at times which was so relaxing. - Cleaners did a great job tidying up and cleaning the apartment on a daily basis. Negatives:- Unfortunately the apartment above us were very noisy and liked to come back at stupid o'clock in the morning every single night we were there (7 nights), pulling the chairs across the wooden floors and stomping around in noisy shoes.- The apartment also had ants, which weren't a massive problem as I know it does happen. Just don't leave food on the counter top. We woke up to a fresh loaf of bread completely covered in ants one morning...- The buffet restaurant is most definitely not worth the €36 per person... extortionate for such little choice in food!!- Not too sure/keen on the billing system and adding a bill to your room number. At the end of our stay our room bill apparently came to €89. We paid for everything as we went. They brought out the receipts where 1 wasn't even signed, and the other had a completely random persons signature. Luckily the hotel staff believed us that they weren't our bills. Made us think how easy it is to get away with not paying for things! (Not that we would ever do that). Think this system needs rethinking. - The bar near the reception needs more staff... it took so long to get served, especially when there's an event going on like wedding. Probably queued for about 20 minutes for a drink. Overall we really enjoyed our stay despite some negatives. If we were to stay again then we'd probably try and get a hotel room rather than an apartment."
Sep 2017,40,family wedding,"Nice hotel, spacious, nice beach, breakfast area very congested, for such a big hotel,l thought it was very badly laid out, lovely pools. Area for wedding very nice, service for wedding meal a bit slow."
Sep 2017,30,"friendly, nice place, stress in te evening","nearly everything was ok to very good, but dinner time I disliked more and more everyday! to much service at all, waiters run around the tables and catch everything, what they think is ready to take away. I like more eating as a nice part of the evening than in rush hour. Not understandable that not even water was in the half pension dinner included. You had to pay on table everyday! Why not put it on the room number and pay all on checkout?"
Sep 2017,40,Lovely Resort with a fantastic Spa,"We were a group of friends staying in the Santa Eulalia on-site apartments. The resort is perfect, with plenty of space for everyone helped by having several swimming pools plus a generous section ofbeach. The on-site restaurants provide lovely dishes; staff members are friendly and competent and took care of us very well. The spa area is extensive and modern and also extremely well run. They offer a full programme, provide wonderful treatments and take excellent care of their guests. I'd love to go back there."
Sep 2017,40,If evening Dinner is important to you this may not be the place to go!,"Overall this hotel delivers what it advertises and is of the standard that it claims.However, my wife and I, who are seasoned travellers over several decades, were very disappointed with the food format, selection and general ambience of the Cozinha Restaurant at Dinner. Main courses were mainly casseroles, the soup was lukewarm and the advertised dress code was widely ignored. We have eaten and enjoyed many Buffet Dinners whilst on holiday but found the Cozinha to be the most disappointing when measured alongside the general standard of the hotel. This alone would discourage us from recommending to others who see evening Dinner as an important part of their holiday. On reflection, if we had booked Room and Breakfast we would have rated the hotel as excellent."
Sep 2017,30,Nice resort: family-friendly,"Was a nice resort with lots to do and awesome pool area/terrace. Close to the beach as well. Wasn't pleased you had to pay €20 to use the spa pools, but there were 3 pools outside on terraces that were nice. Place is very kid-friendly though and my boyfriend and I were not expecting that. Rooms were clean and spacious, but definitely older in a way. We had a balcony with a nice view of the ocean that was beautiful.  Overall, was a good stay."
Sep 2017,40,Great location,"Nice comfortable hotel. Roomy accommodations, and very clean. The grounds are well maintained and the layout of the hotel is expansive. Great location, on beach and within walking distance to restaurants."
Sep 2017,50,Beautiful Location and Excellent Service,"I organized a conference at the hotel in late September. The location and setting is absolutely stunning, with beautiful Santa Eulália beach within eyesight and a short walk across the road. The business facilities at the hotel are excellent and so is the conference support team. Their helpfulness, flexibility and attention to detail really contributed to the overall success of the event. The hotel offers rather a number of Food and Beverage venues and they were all very good both in terms of service and quality of the food presented. The private dining functions we had at the hotel in Santa Eulália restaurant overlooking the beach were really something special. The leisure facilities at the hotel are excellent as well, the heated pool was lovely for those afraid to brave the ocean off season. The rooms are large and impeccably clean, the beds are super comfortable. The hotel was great value in general given the amazing location, facilities and the friendly and helpful staff. I would not hesitate in recommending Grande Real Santa Eulália Resort and Spa to both the business and the leisure traveler and will likely be back myself in the near future."
Sep 2017,50,First timers,"This was our first time in the Algarve and not our usual sort of holiday.  From the start we were made to feel welcome and we're impressed by the facilities and standard of accommodation.  It was a shame that there was a coffee maker but no filters etc, however we soon found the local shop.  We had a great time exploring beaches and towns and the food in the restaurants was varied and good quality.  Our only complaint was that most of the cooked vegetables were mixtures which included courgettes.  Not great if you are allergic to them!  Suggest some veg served individually would help.  Apart from that and a travel rep who seemed to think we were in a different resort we had a wonderful time and recommend this resort for anyone wanting a quality holiday without too much noise and partying."
Sep 2017,40,Fabulous location,"We stayed in a studio which luckily overlooked the swimming pool but would consider staying in a suite in the actual hotel next time as they have stunning views out to sea.  The staff were extremely helpful and very polite. We didn't use the spa as the prices were expensive.  The hotel bars and restaurants were also expensive;  however,  the beach bar was very cheap for drinks. We spent most time using the shuttle bus to Albufeira Old Town which is only 10 minutes away but there is a 3 hours gap whereby the bus doesn't run. Overall, a fabulous place to stay  but would rate only the hotel itself as 5 star and not the apartments."
Sep 2017,40,"Excellent, clean hotel in great location",Excellent clean hotel in great location. Food and drink was Suberb although a little pricey but you're not just paying for drink you're paying for a great location and atmosphere.My only issue was our apartment was near the road in the resort and found it very noisy at night with traffic which led to broken sleep. I hope to return but will stay away from road.
Sep 2017,40,Regular visitor,"We have stayed at the apartments at this hotel for many years. The staff are fantastic and are very helpful. The apartments are very compact and very clean, apart from a little ant issue. The rooms have become very dated and could do with a makeover, as they have not changed since the hotel opened. Considering the rates for the rooms I think that you could probably find something of a larger size and more updated, however the location is excellent."
Sep 2017,50,Beautiful Hotel,the only negative I have is that there are no ramps from the hotel to the lunch restaurant on the way to the beach.  We had a 18 month baby therefore we had to life the buggy down many steps and also our room was not ready on arrival which is difficult when you have been travelling from 4.00am with a baby who needs sleep.
Sep 2017,50,Great holiday in lovely surroundings,"Lovely surprise, apartment large, brightly coloured and kept immaculately clean by staff. Pools were cold, except one which was heated, TV was all Portuguese which was a shame but didn't spoil our holiday. Cooked breakfast was sometimes lukewarm but the breakfast choice, including bucks fizz was superb. The bus to Albufeira was very useful and the staff were all cheerful and helpful, especially to my wife who is a coeliac, and is gluten free. We will definitely return here, the position of the hotel overlooking the sea is amazing. One of the best hotels we've stayed in. Highly recommend. We had champagne on ice with a plate of mini goodies waiting in our room on arrival as we booked this trip as part of our 40th anniversary celebrations. We weren't disappointed. Beds are quite hard but massive, truly a lovely place."
Sep 2017,50,Would recommend,A lovely stay staff very helpful and friendly location very good lovely beach and close to old and new town with free shuttle service. Rooms clean and good variety of areas to sit out dun bathe swim and relax. A bit busy as there were lots of wedding parties which meant restaurant could be quite noisy.
Sep 2017,50,Beat hotel by far,We have been here at least 4 times before and it never fails to impress.  Great staff...great facilities....fabulous food.....brilliant spa and the best apple mojitos I've ever had.There is also a hidden gem - the Santa eulalia restaurant which is by the beach.  Amazing food....served in traditional Portuguese style or European...something for everyone.  Open for dinner only but its worth it.  Open to non hotel residents too(access from beach car park). Worth a visit!
Sep 2017,40,wonderful stay in paradise,"beautiful and calm hotel area with many pools, not overcrowded, parking houses for rented cars for free. Free access to the beautiful beach. Short distance to Albufeira with a free bus ride from the hotel. Only the food at the evening buffet was not warm enough :( Still I can heartly recommend this hotel!"
Sep 2017,50,A Holiday to repeat,"A lovely resort only 40 minutes away by car from the airport  Faro. It has different appartment Units with two pools each-one for small children. My studio had a bedroom a livingroom and fully equipped kitchen . Breakfast was in the Main building about a Five Minute Walk from My studio. Breakfast was Continental with a variety of Bread, cheese, sausage, pastry and much more, an Own cook and Even Champagner. The grounds have different Restaurants and Bars, a spa and Access to the Beach. I was Herr at the beginning of September so Not man other guest were Here.I Enjoyed My Stay very much"
Sep 2017,40,Very good hotel,"2nd visit here, our first being in 2015. I would say the 5 star rating probably applies to the resort as a whole (which is beautiful) rather than the accomodation. We stayed in a 1-bedroom apartment, which was fine, though a little tired. Did have part of a tile come off the wall in kitchen area. Housekeeping was excellent and any problems (like the dust which was clogging up fan in bathroom) were dealt with promptly. Breakfast buffet was ok, nothing special but plentiful. Restaurant always busy but staff seemed to cope well. Loved the pool areas and you could always get a sunbed. Only thing was the pool bar was closed and there was no explanation why. We did take advantage once of the shuttle bus into old town but taxis are cheap enough to get around. I recommend the Santa Eulalia restaurant for top quality seafood and fantastic ocean views. Reception staff were always helpful and, overall, think this is still a great resort."
Sep 2017,40,A great week in Santa eulalia,"We enjoyed our week in Grand Real Santa Eulalia. Everything was perfect but our room 214  Dodd not get any sun and it was not possible to sit on balcony. The pool area was v good and there was,plenty of room for everyone. The staff were amazing, very helpful and pleasant at all times. I also found them friendly . There was a huge variety for breakfast and the restaurant was sunny and bright."
Sep 2017,50,Perfect for a relaxing getaway,"Fantastic Hotel, Friendly Staff, Clean Rooms, Great Location, Perfect for a relaxing getaway. 20 minutes walk from the Strip, and about 40 to the old town. Therr is a free bus services provided by the hotel. It unfortunately is a first come first survived bases. There is two resturants just out side the hotel gates that are brilliant.  I would recommend the Calzone in RM. The Indian Sizzler in the new town is an amazing Indian, the Prawn Puri is fantastic. Would recommend a Studio apartment for more value and peace."
Sep 2017,30,Could be better,"I would have given this hotel a lower rating but I do think it's better than average and there's no 3 and a half stars so gave it 4. We loved the position of the hotel, direct access to the beach and about a 25 minute walk to the strip.  We would have gladly upgraded to a sea view room but there was no availability. Breakfast was adequate, the cakes and pastry items were very good but the cooked breakfast items were pretty poor with bacon more like plastic soaked in oil and the fried eggs not done to order  like we usually find in other hotels and everything was all a bit messy.  Rooms and bathrooms are a good size with air conditioning working really well. TV wasn't working very well but you don't go on holiday to watch TV so it didn't bother us. Rooms were spotless clean.The area around the pool is very nice but there's no cushions for the loungers so not very comfortable and the water in the pool is freezing, I don't like the water to be too warm as it's not refreshing but it really was too cold. Also with the clients being mainly British the beach bar is always really busy, there was usually about 10 people waiting to be served and service was very slow, there needs to be at least another person serving people.Reception  staff could be more friendly, they very rarely wished anyone a good morning or afternoon so maybe some staff training wouldn't go amiss.All in all I think this hotel could be really good with just a little more attention to detail. I don't know if we'd return."
Sep 2017,50,Please try this hotel ,"This is our second time this year to the hotel and found it friendly and great value. It is a five star hotel and the food is to die for, every meal is fresh and tasty.The staff are great and make you feel more than welcome, we received a free bottle of wine and fruit on our return and the staff remembered the two boys so it felt nice."
Sep 2017,50,Great holiday,"Have stopped here many times over the last 10 years and still find the hotel to a high standard. Stopped bed and breakfast found breakfast very good with a varied selection of food, went to the Altantico cafe at lunch very prompt service, good food and excellent value for money.  Ate in the restaurant Santa Eulalia in the evening very good food and great location to sit outside and dine while enjoying the views over the sea. Rooms very spacious, clean and tidy and great house keeping. Drinks prices are what you would expect for a 5 star hotel and would definitely recommend trying the cocktails as these are excellent. All the staff give a excellent service and are a credit to the hotel. We have already booked another holiday here again for next year"
Sep 2017,50,Excellent stay,"Me and my partner and 10 year old experienced a fantastic stay at this hotel! Staff are so friendly! Can’t do enough for you and the room is spotless!!! The facilities are what your paying for and they don’t compare to other hotels in the town! Fantastic!!! It wa any birthday during my stay (I didn’t inform them, they just took passports) and I was bowled over with a bottle of prosecco and a birthday cake with candle room serviced to my room!!! Cannot wait to go back!!!"
Sep 2017,50,We have just returned from a weeks holiday (sept 2017) from this hotel and it was absolutely brilliant.,"The location is brilliant if you want to just chill or jump in a taxi for 8 euros to the old and new town. The only negative I could say is that reception gave us the wrong time for the coach to pick us up to take us back to the airport, which resulted in one mad rush and forgetting some iteams of clothing behind. Would definitely go back. Our maid was amazing also (545)."
Sep 2017,30,September 2017,"hotel location excellent, breakfast very poor, fried eggs etc COLD, no English tv  in rooms with poor reception on other channels.Hotel staff excellent, Atlantico bar/restaurant excellent. Good restaurants and bars 10 mins walk from hotel. Good stay spoiled by breakfast and lack of tv ."
Sep 2017,30,Not Five Star Hotel,"I have just returned from a weeks holiday in the hotel. This hotel is certainly not 5*. The rooms were clean and tidy but in need of upgrading. There was only one British channel on the TV. We were booked in for half board but had to eat out most evenings due to the food in the main restaurant. The food was bland and tasteless and there was very little choice, one night I was reduced to eating some salad and a bread roll because of the lack of choice. The breakfast was adequate but uninspiring. This was the opinion of other guests that we spoke to. The bar had branded drinks on the menu but these were never available when requested. The pool area could also have been improved by providing mattresses for the sunbeds. This area could be untidy with litter. I found the reception area and staff very helpful. I certainly will not be returning to this hotel."
Sep 2017,50,Recent stay at the Santa Eulalia Hotel,"We travelled here for a wedding which was being held in the hotel. From the minute we arrived we were made feel extremely welcome, reception staff were fab, appartments were excellant and very well equipped."
Sep 2017,40,Great holiday,Stayed at this hotel on numerous occasions and have found it an excellent base to visit other areas.  The hotel and its staff are very efficient and helpful.  Since it has been modernised some great improvements have brought the hotel into a different category.  We would thoroughly recommend the Santa Elalia and would go back tomorrow if we could.
Sep 2017,50,Vacation with friends,"Hotel excellent as always. We have stayed at this hotel at least  seven times. We saw the hotel being built. We fell in love with beach. And we are never ever dissapointed with hotel, staff and food. It's a pleasure always to be returning to theIs hotel.xx😄"
Sep 2017,50,great hotel not to be missed,"top hotel cleaners on the ball ,great location no noise, pool side food not to be missed,tv in rooms internet and aircon in each room make a big difference.if you need any info reception always on hand to help ,but i used antonio the bar man great lad for were to go like shops/bars/restaurants"
Sep 2017,50,Lovely relaxing holiday,"My husband and I spent 2 weeks, half board, at this lovely hotel (Sept 2017). The Hotel itself isn't very big compared to others which we found perfect. It was very well maintained both inside and outside. Pool area was lovely with ample sun loungers and tables.There was also a garden area adjacent to the pool area which also had sun loungers and tables, this was also very well maintained. Our room was very spacious with a separate small kitchenette containing a 2 ring hob, fridge, microwave, kettle, toaster and pots, pans, plates and utensils. The fridge was very useful to us although we didn't need to use the other equipment.  Our bed was comfortable and made daily when our room was serviced. We had fresh towels daily also. We had a flat screen TV which had many English channels (including ITV) as well as other foreign channels. Wifi was free and very good in all areas of the hotel, including our room, pool and garden area which is rare in our previous experience of hotels. The breakfast was ample with a good range of choice, evening meal was also very good although the choice of food wasn't vast but I would say catered for different requirements. It was always well presented and replenished. The snack bar adjacent to the pool had a good choice of food available, very reasonably priced and nicely prepared and presented. The bar area was very good, a good range of drinks available with excellent service. There is a self-service launderette on site which I found useful. It was 3 Euro to wash (inc detergent) and 3 Euro to dry with also the use of an iron and board.We didn't personally use the Spa facility although there was various treatments available.All the staff were friendly and helpful, we got to know most of them and they were very good in advising us of places to see and visit. The hotel maintained high standards of cleanliness throughout.The location was ideal. There was a bus stop a stones throw away and the hotel itself had a car park which was free to guests.  There are two nearby beaches, I would say around 5 to 10 mins walk. These are down hill, often quite steep. Both nearby beaches were lovely with access to food and drink. We often walked along the beach to get to Albufeira Old Town, this took us around 40 mins however there is a good bus service. It was around a 5 minute walk to the ""strip"" which has many bars and shops. We found the hotel location to be perfect as it was in a quiet spot however there was plenty of activity nearby if"
Sep 2017,10,Rooms rundown and in disrepair. Customer service terrible,"Our apartment's roof was leaking, and customer service was absolutely shocking. The ""manager"" João [--] was rude and unprofessional and did nothing to assist us. We were told that damage to the rooms was the result of a flood that had occurred and that nothing could be done. Damaged rooms should not be sold to the public before they are repaired. Albufeira is absolutely beautiful but I'll never be staying with this chain again after my experience and I urge others to avoid as well. By far the worst of any 5 star resort I've stayed in - avoid at all costs."
Sep 2017,50,Sept 2017,Rooms had very good facility's and very clean. Towels where changed every day which was a refreshing change.Rooms were also cleaned on request.The only issue we had was the balcony light didn't work although this was reported twice.
Sep 2017,40,Grande real Eulalia,"Hotel Eulalia: walking distance tot the nearest beach 20 minutes. To the nearest restaurant 5 minutes. To the center of town 1 hour. The hotel employees are friendly and helpfull. The Hotel lays on a busy road so we asked for a room on the back of the hotel. This room was fine, only the balcony was very windy. Rooms where clean and staff was very nice."
Sep 2017,50,My stay in Algarve,"Very pleasant stay in a nice hotel with very kind employees, nice location and excellent breakfast. Easy access and car park availability at any time.Several pools available with bars, relax chairs and umbrellas."
Sep 2017,50,"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Facilities, & Excellent access to beach from hotel","Only thing I would fault was main bar in lobby was too small with little facilities. For the price paid 1 week, Sept 11th to Sept 16th incl,  I would have expected a sea view. Stayed in room 208. Girl at reception was such a nice lady and your biggest asset. She was the lady that checked us out. Also helpful during our stay and a complete professional. Also a good looking woman if I am allowed say so.She listens to your clients and delivers. She also recommended car hire for us. She got it spot on all the time. Please tell her both my wife and I think she was such a true professional."
Sep 2017,40,Great value for money,"We had a lackey, relaxing break.  I especially enjoyed the spa pool, which was an amazing experience.  Is good I went twice in four days. Food is first rate.  The only things I would mention is that the carpets need a good clean in the rooms - some of the stains are very off putting - and there appears to be nowhere to buy a bottle of water, which surprised me as there is a shop in the main floor - I think this is an opportunity missed! On the whole - a great stay in a very comfortable hotel.  We'll be back."
Sep 2017,40,Nice Holliday,"Spectaculos view of the coast, good food, and relax! Algarve is a very nice place to visit along the whole coast. The water was a little bit too cold but the beaches are amazing. The caves and the old towns of every city have to be on the visit plan of everyone."
Sep 2017,50,<3,"Great relaxing holiday, the perfect resort for sunshine and relaxation!Would have loved to see some more veggie/vegan options at the buffet, but otherwise perfect.Would happily return and will be recommending to others"
Sep 2017,40,Great place just avoid the buffet ,"This place was great to stay! Location, beach and resort were really good.. live entertainment was a blast! The only thing I wouldn't recommend at all!!! Is the buffet, we tried it for dinner and it was like a cafeteria in a hospital :( I ended up eating a bun, my husband had a plate of stuff but was not satisfied what so ever and then in the end we got charged $64 euro.. 32 euro for a bun?! Not cool.. we made a complaint which normally we don't do but this was really bad.. and we got a ""sorry that's the price of the meal"". The other restaurants in the place were pretty decent! Everyone working in the resort seem very friendly and helpful."
Sep 2017,50,Grande by name and nature,Short trip to get away from the early autum showers. Lovely resort with great facilities and restaurant shuttle bus into old and new townOwn beach that is clean and safe if the sea is a little cold Great service and the beach front restaurant is exceptional and good value
Sep 2017,40,Very clean & spacious hotel,Stayed for 2 weeks lovely comfy & pleasant stayNice quiet location but in the ideal location for restaurants & bars just a short walk awayLovely walk to the beautiful beach10min taxi ride to the old town for around €8 (old town is my favourite place)Would defiantly stay again
Sep 2017,40,September 2017,"This was my second stay at the hotel. I love everything about the hotel, the only improvement I'd recommend would be on the mattresses, pillows and bedding.  They whole ensemble is not very comfortable."
Sep 2017,50,Good location!,"The hotel is located walking distance from the new town strip and main supermarket. The bus stop is also close by and costs €1.40 to get to the old town with buses running every half an hour. The facilities in the room were perfect for our needs, a fridge/ freezer, hob, microwave, toaster, kettle etc. Ideal for nights in or making packed lunches for the beach. The TV comes with a few film channels which play decent well known english films and a music channel, this was useful when my girlfriend was ill and we had a day in watching films! There are 2 beaches within 5-10 mins walk (st Eulalia and Oura) which have shops nearby for water/ food and a restaurnant on the beach for food/ alcohol if you want it. Overall we had an amazing stay and I would recommend this hotel if your planning on going self catering for value for money, location and facilities!"
Sep 2017,50,Fantastic hotel,"We had a fantastic 10 day stay here in July 2017 can't fault this hotel at all, great location  direct access to beautiful beach, absolutely amazing food great bars and pools great rooms staff so friendly and helpful you could tell at every point it is a 5* hotel"
Sep 2017,40,Truthful assessment,"Hotel was fabulous however the description of the pool situation is misleading The adult pool was directly adjacent to the kids pools and the older children were in the designated adult pool with large inflaterbles. It was also salt water and very cold. Recommend the seafront resteraunts, excellent food at an affordable price."
Sep 2017,50,Excellent,"Stayed at this hotel for nine nights for our honeymoon, August 29th to September 7th 2017 beautiful sea view room, excellent standards and services from all the staff I would highly recommend the seafood restaurant, just a short walk from the beach but affiliated with the hotel. Couldn't speak more highly of this hotel and its staff, Claudia who organised our booking through their reservations was so helpful, over all a fantastic stay, I would definitely recommend staying here.Kind regardsEamon."
Sep 2017,50,Enjoyable stay,"We stayed for 6 days in August and would be happy to visit again in the future. The rooms are clean and to a good quality. We had a 1 bedroom with a sofa bed. The sofa bed was not very comfortable but not enough to look to change rooms over. We enjoyed having the terrace area to have some meals, and also being so close to one of the pools. Each 'zone' of the hotel has it's own adult and separate kids pool, and because ours was away from the reception/restaurant area our pool was never very busy and there were always some loungers available. This was useful and unexpected considering it was the peak month of the year. The restaurant selection was good although it would have been useful to have more than 1 restaurant open for dinner earlier than 7 - just because we have young children. There was an excellent buffet breakfast however which set us up for the day. The hotel has a nice beach right behind which although wasn't private always had space and water sports available. The slight letdown was the kids club. Although excellent that it is available, it could have been managed better the staff seemed a little distracted sometimes. In one 'water guns' session the guy running it just handed out the pistols and then stood by the side. The kids had no idea whether a game was running or just a free for all (which it was). It would have been good for him to structure it better and participate. Overall though the kids club did not take away from the rest of the stay as it is a bonus to have it, just feel that it could have been better."
Sep 2017,40,Fantastic Wedding,"I stayed here 3 nights for a friends wedding. Hotel is beautiful, clean and spacious. wedding was very well organised and the wedding planner is exceptional and ensures everything runs smoothly. although i found drinks over priced and bar staff (at main reception) very slow and slightly rude. food was delicious and well presented"
Sep 2017,50,Family holiday,My second time staying here with the family. Both times the stay and hotel were perfect. The new lobby area is very nice. The rooms are perfect with a pool view and night time it looks very well.The room itself has plenty of space and comes with all the basics you would need.
Sep 2017,50,Holiday of a lifetime,Excellent hotel with very friendly staff who would do anything to help make your stay perfect. While it maybe slightly more expensive than other hotels in the vicinity the extra cost is more than worth it. The free shuttle service into the new and old town ensures that you are able to enjoy the best that the Algarve has to offer should you wish to venture outside the hotel grounds.Once again I would like to thank all the staff that helped make our stay perfect.
Sep 2017,50,Great hotel and value for money,"Stayed in this hotel for a week at the start of September, could not recommend more. Hotel was brilliant, staff very friendly and always willing to help - booked taxi for us anytime we needed aswell as airport transfer. Pool and living area all kept very clean. Situated about 5-10 min walk from new town strip and only a 5 min taxi to the old town. Could not recommend this hotel more and if back in albufeira will definitely return to it."
Sep 2017,50,Grande Santa Eulalia,Great hotel and value.We had a great family holiday there at the end of Augustwere at the Atlantic bar most days from 5.30 as there is a DJ playing chilled beats as the sun drops .The restaurant Santa Eulalia was perfect my favorite of the holiday.
Sep 2017,50,Fantastic hotel .,"Everything from the minute we arrived was perfect, staff were very helpful ,nothing was a problem ! Very comfortable , has everything you want to enjoy your stay !  For the first time in long time we were were happy to stay about the hotel for the day ! keep up the good work ."
Sep 2017,40,Nice hotel ,"We stayed at the family apartments and used the hotel as a base to discover beautiful Algarve. The apartments are nice, spacious and very clean! The cleaning services were great! Bed is really big and quite comfy, there is also a convertible coach in the living room and a separate bed which were really handy for kids. We self-catered for breakfast so can't comment on the buffet restaurants but we did use the hotel facilities for lunch. Quick service, good quality and very reasonable priced. I would say that the variety at the pool bar was a bit limited but still ok to choose from. Excellent white sangria!! There is kids club available but our kids did not want to use it and spent most of the time at the pool. There are several of them but we used the central ones. The polls are quite shallow and small which is great for kids but in fact these are the same pools for adults too so it was becoming very busy and unsafe at some point with kids and adults at the same pool. The kids pool is more for babies so mine who are 5 and 7 and can swim already had to be in the common pool. The hotel however is still nice and well located on the (public) beach with private access. At the same time it is relatively close to the restaurants and old city and also provides shuttle bus service (which we did not use as we had a car). Overall nice albeit we used very limited services but the stay was very pleasant."
Sep 2017,40,Family holiday ,Stayed with my wife and daughter. The apartment was spacious and clean. The hotel itself was beautiful. Had a great pool area. The staff were excellent. You get brought to your room by golf buggy. The resort is quite big. Can't comment on food as we didn't eat at the hotel.was expensive. Bar area is beautiful at night. Expect to pay twice the price of a normal bar in the new or old town. It's a good 10 minutes walk to the new town and 15 to the strip.
Sep 2017,50,Fabulous stay,"Fabulous facilities and service in a luxury hotel. Lovely quiet beach with private access, great cafes for lunch, water sports available. Shuttle to greater range of evening restaurants in Albufeira was useful. Great range and variety of hot and cold options included in breakfast buffet- quality better than most inclusive breakfasts. Very minor issues- no full length mirror in the bedroom; access to room not until 3pm; these were outweighed by fresh towels daily for use at beach/pool and daily service of bedroom. Chocolate on the pillow was a nice touch each day!"
Sep 2017,50,Fantastic place. You must try it,The online pictures of this resort do not do it justice. It is fantastic. We were on a self catering basis but the food looked beautiful. The pools were great and the entire hotel was spotless. Staff were fantastic . Can't rate this hotel highly enough. Will definitely be back.
Sep 2017,10,How can you possibly be rated a 5* property?,"We stayed for 3 hours , just long enough to find a real 5 * hotel in the area, so we didn't have to stay in a tired, outdated hotel, with stained carpets in the room, small dirty and overcrowded pools (if you can call them that) with broken chairs and garbage everywhere, and not be hassled at the beach by soubious characters to be told we needed to pay 15 Euros a day for beach loungers and extra for an umbrella, none of which was told to us at check-in...!  Even your manager seemed embarrassed and explained that Theron's will be refurbished in 8 weeks or so and the carpets ripped out and replaced with hardwood after 12 years.  Believe me, you need to do more than replace the floors, the entire tired late 1980s decor of your rooms needs to be renovated and upgraded. You should be ashamed to portray yourselves as a 5* property, and I have no idea what reviewers would rate you as such, or what you paid for them to write such lies.  We stayed at 5* hotels and Pousadas throughout Portugal and we were incredulous and horrified went we checked into your hotel towards the end of our trip.  Thank goodness the Tivoli in Villamoura had space.  You are barely a 3 1/2* as is, 4* would be pushing it on a good day.  Go check out the Palacio do Freixo in Porto, or the Hotel Penha Longa Joel golf resort in Sinatra one of these days, real 5* properties, and melt with shame..."
Sep 2017,50,Ottima esperienza sul mare,"Everything is extremely good. From the location in general to the location near the beach, proximity to the center of S. Eulalia (700 meters), beautiful suites, great food and varied. Even the prices of the umbrella and the spawning bags are affordable compared to Italy, since they are not included in the hotel's availability.Only faint, if you want to be fussy, is the management of the Reception for a 5 star.As if the room is not ready: when it is released it exhorts the staff to clean it and assigns it as soon as it is available. You can not wait to wait four hours for the client, from 10:40 am to 2:40 pm, because no cleaning is organized, although the rooms are released, not based on arrivals but the planned organization. In addition, it must be the Reception to immediately provide the key to the customer suite, just ready, and not solicitous to the customer.Lastly, for payment of the extras, the receptionist before requesting payment and receiving the payment must check the customer for the one that has been consumed and subscribed to the individual invoices, not after total errors have been detected.Suggerisci una modificaEverything is extremely good.

Sep 2017,50,Lovely hotel,"Very clean, great location with free buses into new and old town. Relaxed atmosphere with live singers to listen too with a vino at night. Staff very  friendly and helpful. Mattress wasn't the most comfy but this is only the negative of our whole experience. Would certainly return :)"
Sep 2017,50,Fantastic family holiday,"Fabulous stay at this hotel, I would highly recommend to others. It has everything you need for a five star stay and more besides! We will definetly be returning next year! The hotel is amazing, the staff are fantastic, the amenities are first rate."
Sep 2017,20,Average,"I stayed in this hotel for only one night and I think that was enough.Staff training and hotel organization should be improved. At the time of check in the a staff member informed me that I could pay soon or just at the end, to which I replied that I would pay at the end of the stay and that I could use the card that had been used to make the reservation. He informed me that for security reasons he did not have access to this data. I then handed him the same card and noticed that the employee was writing the card number, expiration date, and CVV on paper. When I asked him what he was doing he answered that he would later put those data into the computer system. I asked him if he thought it was safe what he was doing, and he replied that it was hotel policy. So if for security reasons they do not have access to the data of the card from the hotel reservations platform why during the check in the employee is writing those data in a random paper, that anyone can see and may lead to illegal movements with my card? I made the payment at the time since I do not want to have card cloned.In the room the furniture was aged, especially the outdoor chairs and table. The carpet was worned and with multiple stains. The window facing the sea is not effective in blocking the sun, causing the room to become an authentic oven (even with maximum air conditioning).The food is average.Positives: the wonderful view to the sea from the rooms with sea view and the proximity to the beach.To improve: customer data security policy and staff training ."
Sep 2017,40,Hard to Beat,"Having stayed here on multiple occasions  and our second time this year , this time by far has been our best stay yet at the hotel. Front of house reception check in and service throughout stay is the best we have experienced. Communication between teams is smooth and overall service is great. Breakfast team are always welcoming & friendly and  guest requests are handled with a smile. Rooms are a little tired but the service & facilities offered by the hotel outshine this point by far."
Sep 2017,50,Excellent Hotel,"Excellent hotel, kind staff, very good choice of restaurants.Room very clean, beautiful view. Nice beach.We will recommend the hotel to our friends. Beautiful private area with plenty of trees. Good service at the pool. Next time we will stay longer."
Sep 2017,30,nice hotel with great view,"Hotel is quite OK, hovewer some girls working at the reception desck have hardly any knowledge about anything. I got no information about pick up place, wrong info about timing of particular event (so I was almost 1 hour late!), resevation of bout trip was made incorrectly (so I had to get there twice, loosing 2 days of my stay). And what is worst - I strongly poisoned myself with the restaurant food (COZINHA) and while asked in the reception for some drugs to help didn't get any. Not even simple carbon. The bed was not too comfortable"
Aug 2017,50,Excellent,"The hotel and surrounding grounds were stunning, the beach was a 3 minute walk from the reception and was clean and not too busy. Everytime we had a question, the reception staff where more than helpful, especially David! They also helped us arrange a transfer for a day trip to Aquashow. The room was large and comfortable although the pillows were a bit thin. The balcony was large and clean. The whole hotel complex was very clean. We had breakfast which we slaughtered every morning, although it would be good if it was available until later (half 10 is latest). Good selection and everything was replenished throughout the morning. In terms of location we found everything very accessible although we had rented scooters. The main strip was about a half an hour walk, uphill,  but only 5 minutes on our scooters. If you do go out to eat we would highly recommend the sizzling stone just on the main strip. We would also recommend the Seafood Restaurant within the hotel, we were given a wine voucher for this which was a nice extra. Overall we were very satisfied with the hotel"
Aug 2017,40,Family Holiday,Stayed at the hotel with my wife and two young sons. The hotel is very nice and we all had a great time.The apartments were comfortable with a swimming pool right outside and the beach nearby. The  food was especially nice.
Aug 2017,20,More 2 Star than 5 Star,"Place looks nice and grand on checking in and rooms are of a reasonable size and very clean. We took ourselves to the pool area for a swim and here was the 1st issue - an absolute lack of sunbeds for the number of patrons, a lot of people lying in the grass ! This  is totally unacceptable for my age and considering the cost of accommodation. Also the food at the pool restaurant is very bland and please clean the glasses and cutlery - filthy. Breakfast the next morning was an absolute nightmare , first we had to queue up for ages ? Then into a packed room full of people , the noise of screaming kids is horrendous. The food again was bland and cold. Tables and cutlery filthy once more. I don't understand how this place is rated 5 stars (only 5 star prices) and our stay was far from quiet and relaxing . Very basic stuff needs to be fixed here. Won't be rushing back"
Aug 2017,40,Great staff,"Located near the waters edge with super views if you book a sea view room.However the evening entertainment and the total lack of atmosphere left a lot to be desired. We were there in the winter months and it was like a morgue listening to cheap entertainers in a brightly light lobby bar.Why don't the management light candles on the tables  or reduce the massive overhead lights.No wonder most of the residents were in their rooms.Excellent reception staff, very expensive bar and restaurant prices  so we eventually went elsewhere at night.We asked if they had any Portuguese folklore with signing and dancing but to no avail.That's why we travel to other countries to experience their culture but in this 5* hotel forget about quality evening entertainment. A lovely hotel with great staff but leave the the place after 8 pm and go elsewhere."
Aug 2017,50,Family holiday,Recently visited with my wife and two kids.  We stayed in the apartments.  Food was excellent and of the highest quality.  Facilities were of the highest quality.  You are right on the beach with nice lunch and dinner option 2 mins walk from hotel.  I would recommend breakfast as this option was super.  There are different themed nights with the Barbie on the sat night being excellent.  The kids club is also free and very well supervised.  We will be going back as we didn't need to leave.
Aug 2017,40,Mr Harbinson,"Great hotel right on beach. If you want clean, fairly modern hotel with helpful staff and swimming pools, beach 4 mins from hotel and good hotel restaurants then this is the place to go! 10/20 from both New town Albufeira and/or Old town Albufeira! Clean beach. Restaurants serve good food. Bear in mind though the hotel prices are on high side. Guests from Portugal, Denmark, Poland, UK and Ireland mostly. Nice place"
Aug 2017,40,Nice hotel for a 7 day stay,"We stayed in a one bed apartment, which was clean and had excellent air conditioning. Decorated in a traditional rustic Portuguese way. It was close to the main road but the windows kept any road to noise to a minimum and this did not impact on us. The bed was rock hard - sore shoulders by the end, although my wife found it to be OK. There are 3 pool areas, so all accommodation is near to one. The main pool is salt water, which some children won't like; the other two by the apartment are chlorine. There is a snack bar next to each serving sandwiches /salads/drinks - salads are about 9 Euros. Crisps 2 Euros. Apartment WiFi was good but TV reception was poor, with limited English speaking channels. Best apartments are lower numbers under 500. Ours was 579 and was quite a way from the main hotel (250m) and by the main road. We stayed on a B&B basis - get to breakfast before 9am as after that there are queues and its a bit of a scrum because the service area is a little small. Good choice of food at breakfast, from cooked to fruit, pastries etc. Breakfast quality was 7/10 - the hot food wasn't very hot and it was the same food choice everyday.Service was good but quite laid back. There are 5 restaurants on site but we only tried the burger one, which was OK. Off site, there isn't much near by. Albufeira is a 10 minute walk; we went there for a supermarket but we didn't venture further as it looked like a bit of a war zone. For a good basic meal, you could try the 3 Marias - 10 mins walk the other way; basic set menu, with local fish and meat and like stepping back to the 70s! We enjoyed it. We also went to Hollands Bar and restaurant - food was pretty good and the host was a lovely Dutch guy. Martins Restaurant was OK - quite basic food and not great value.Overall, the hotel was probably a 4 Star in our opinion. We went to 4 star Iberostar last year in Majorca and overall, the Iberostar was a better experience. The Grande Real Santa Eulalia Hotel was quite nice, clean, provided decent service, an OK kids club, nice pool areas, a little expensive for food, was on a beach front location and good for a 7 day family break."
Aug 2017,50,Tour Short visit in Grande Real,Excellent hotel to stay! Very good for familys. I would recommend this location to my Friends. Maybe we come again. Congratulations to the whole stuff. Tue Stuff is Very Friendly. Beach is Clean. Best greetings Form Austria
Aug 2017,50,Fabulous hotel,"Entirely our fault that we hadnt originally booked this hotel!  On arrival we clearly weren't  checked in  and were in fact at the Santa Elualia hotel and spa -  they are worlds apart . Jaoa, duty manager  reserved us an apartment and our travel agent with Jet2 were both brilliant and we were moved after one night .  The hotel is truly excellent"
Aug 2017,50,Paradise,"The only two things I can comment on is the wifi connection in the room that was a bit weak. The drinks (juices only), the sauna and the Turkish bath needed to be free for such a class hotel! But they were highly priced!"
Aug 2017,10,Hidden Costs - poor service,"No way this could be considered 5 star with all the hidden costs.Poor service, forever to wait for drink, expensive and water not chilled.We upgraded to suite and this was also poor with stained carpet, chips out of furniture and pull down bed.  Not 5 star luxury.We were full board but only could use in one of many restaurants.  Lunch was awful only looking for snack but no vouchers did  not cover that.  Good luck waiting on drink and paying a bill, you will need patience.  No 5 star service.Within first few days hotel tried to remove 550 Euros in case we damaged room.  We certainly could not have made it worse.Disappointed and angry is an understatement.....Love Portugal but will never"
Aug 2017,10,Not recommended.,"The hotel and beach is very nice which is why they get a decent rating, but the service and food is the worst I have ever experienced in a 5 star hotel. There is no point in getting half or full board because the waiters specially around dinner time never stop by your table, i usually finished my main meal long before my first drink arrived. Room service charges you 15euros for a tin food salad that takes around 60mins to arrive. I have nothing good to say about the service except that one of the managers offered us a free night in a suite to make up for it, we took him up on his offer and after that the staff had clearly made a bit more effort, but it still doesn't excuse what we had to deal with for 3 days."
Aug 2017,40,Highly Recommended Place to Stay,"This is a very nice hotel, just above a beautiful beach about a 5 minute drive outside of the new town section of Albufiera.  Though listed as a 5 star hotel, it is by most international standards a 4 star.  Rooms are nice, bathrooms are a little dated, and the furnishings are modern but a little worn.  Also, the pools are small, so much so that the fresh water pool feels dirty by the end of the day.  The larger (but not large) salt water pool is much cleaner.  The pool area itself is large, with plenty of chairs, so a good place to sun.  Taking breakfast outside is also nice.  The hotel does not have its own beach club, so chairs and umbrella are available from an outside company.The food isn't bad, but nothing special.  Breakfast buffet is large, but very crowded, with a big spread.  But, comparing it to a Club Med buffet, it comes out second best.  Dinner was also fine, not fantastic.  Better to venture outside the hotel to some local spots.  Plenty of good food in local Portuguese spots (avoid the big touristy restaurants), especially the fish restaurant (Pescador) one property away along the beach.  Outstanding fish.But, you cannot beat the setting for this hotel, with a helpful and friendly staff, and about as good and large a white sand beach as you can ever hope to find that is not overcrowded.  We really enjoyed our stay, and would come back in a heartbeat."
Aug 2017,40,Fabulous holiday!,"Great location. Staff were great and very friendly. The beach was lovely, great access to water sports. Easy drive to other fabulous beaches and a convenient bus service to the old town. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly!"
Aug 2017,40,Large group family holiday for our wedding. ,We all stayed at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia as we were in Portugal for our wedding. Overall we were incredibly happy with this hotel. There were plenty of sun beds and we didn't struggle to get them on any days. The children's pools were great and perfect for all of the little children in our party. They were cleaned daily and emptied each morning. Our apartment was spacious and had everything you would need to be self catering. They were cleaned daily and were spotless. The housekeeping staff were super! There were just a few things which slightly spoilt our experience. The first was how busy the breakfast restaurant was. Some days we had to queue for quite some time to get a table. For the number of quests the restaurant could probably be double the size! You seemed to constantly be battling to get your breakfast and had people leaning over you. Not the most relaxing experience. The second issue is that we had my grandmother with us who doesn't walk well and uses a wheelchair. Getting round the hotel with wheelchairs and pushchairs is not very easy. Getting to the beach is almost impossible due to stairs. All in all we had an excellent holiday and would visit again.
Aug 2017,50,2nd visit and won't be my last,"It's quite simple,I love this hotel,for so many reasons,in an absolutely tranquil location overlooking an amazing beach,which seems to have more locals than other holiday beaches that I have ever been on which is obviously a great sign,it gives you the ultimate Portuguese feel to the area,nothing is too much trouble,the service is fab,drinks and food are top drawer,great pools,very clean and very close to nightlife,although the strip is bananas,their are some really great dining options,namely el rancho steak house,amazing fillet of steak,but our preferred option is the old town,with its large variety of eateries and bars,their is something their for everyone,my favourite restaurant in the old town is Mi sombrero Mexican,always a line of people waiting to get in but worth the wait,very casual but amazing food,,,our night was always capped by returning to the hotel for a night cap on a huge terrace with a class of champagne,over looking the moon soaked Atlantic Ocean,it's not a cheap option,but under the circumstances you pay for what you get...."
Aug 2017,50,Very amazing family experience,"The hotel location was spectacular, the hotel staff were amazing, the food at the many different restaurants in the hotel were delicious and my family and i loved our stay. My family and i can't wait to stay there again."
Aug 2017,50,A spacious and inviting hotel in a beautiful beach-side location.,"This is a hotel with a really inviting and relaxing atmosphere. Great feeling of space thanks to a well designed foyer and receptions area; generously appointed rooms; and various outdoor areas. All the staff were so welcoming and efficient and, most importantly, approachable. Situated conveniently close to both old and new towns without being too close. We are about to book again for next year - something we have never done before. This place is a real gem. Food tip:Try the restaurant located in the basement of the big supermarket in new town (ask at reception for exact location and name) Don't be put off by the location, the ingredients couldn't be fresher, and the dishes are reasonably priced and you see the food being prepared and cooked. Plus its where the locals eat."
Aug 2017,50,Fabulous Hotel Best in Algarve!,"This hotel is outstanding! The management and staff are fabulous. Definitely 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️. This hotel is fantastic for everyone from couples, families & all ages. I have been coming for numerous years and would always come back to Grande Real Santa Eulalia it's just amazing!!!"
Aug 2017,40,Family break,"We (2 adults and 2 children aged 5 & 4) spent a week in a 1 bed apartment.  We hired a car (free parking and no problems finding a space).  In general the resort was good, although tired in some areas.Apartment was spacious and had everything we needed, cleaned daily by friendly housekeeping staff.We spent most of our time at the pool near to the apartments.  Despite it being peak school holiday season we always managed to find beds and space in the pool.  The beach is nice, although expect to pay for hire of beds/parasols.Restaurants: we only ate in Atlantico and had lunch a couple of times in the Real Bar.  Both were ok.  Preferred to travel to the Old Town or Vilamoura for wider restaurant choices. Entertainment: there are lots of activities, although some require payment - e.g. €5 for kids tennis.  We spent most evenings in the Real Bar where there is live music.  Kids are welcome everywhere.Overall we enjoyed our stay.  Perfect for a break with young kids."
Aug 2017,40,A bit far out,We spent a lovely week in this resort.  Its a little bit out of the main hub of things but if its a total chill you are looking for this is the place for you!! Private access to beach is fab.  Pool area by apartments not as busy as main hotel pools and was perfect for kids and adults alike. Apartment was a great size and always spotless.  Food & Drink prices for a 5star hotel were very good.  It was my birthday whilst there and we arrived back to apartment to find a Happy Birthday cake and bottle of Champagne which was a lovely touch.  A classy hotel but entertainment at night hit and miss.Enjoyable stay.
Aug 2017,50,Outstanding ,"This is a fantastic resort..... situated on the beach it has plenty of pools, restaurants, bars and all very relaxing. The staff are fantastic from reception to the housekeepers all very friendly and helpful. Marco who works at the pool bar was great, personable, chatty and so professional. I would definitely return to stay here. Great for families and couples of all ages!!"
Aug 2017,50,Amazing Hotel,"We stayed for 9 nights and had the most incredible time. The breakfasts are fabulous and plentiful . They have a few pools and we were always able to get a sun lounger, if you fancy the beach its outside the hotel . The staff are extremely helpful and friendly , I have to mention 2 in particular namely Rui and Stephen at reception who really went the extra mile . We are in no doubt that we will be returning to this hotel again."
Aug 2017,50,Outstanding hotel,Fabulous hotel with amazing facilities.  Large and comfy rooms with generous pools and high all round standards.  Location is okay as it is 1.5miles from the new town of Albufeira but it does have a free bus.  The only downside was the kids club is not up to much.
Aug 2017,50,Family holiday,We been there earlier than time to check in and we were given an upgrade to a beautiful room. Service was outstanding. Dinner and lunch was bit expensive. All of them speak good English. Beach is walkable from the hotel.
Aug 2017,50,Wonderful Holiday,"Great service , friendly staff, stunning views of the sea , we had clean towels every day , our room was lovely , there are three pools and plenty of sunbeds, our favorite  place to eat was the Atlantico Restaurant Bar"
Aug 2017,20,Deception,"It was the 5th year that i stayed in this hotel with my husband and my 3 children, because it was always a good choice for a big family like ours, with an apartment were we could all stay together, near the beach, with a good breakfast and all the facilities. But not this year! The apartments needs a renovation, the sun hats in the first days were broken and breakfast if we didn't go before nine o'clock it was completely chaos, few employees and most of them with no experience.Even in the reception, staff with no experience and careless presentation.its notorious the absence of a supervisor.This is no longer a five star hotel! It's sad!"
Aug 2017,50,Fantastic holiday,"Went with husband and 4 & 6 year old sons. Self catering appt. We had a fantastic holiday, always got a sunbed at a pool. Beach so close and lovely. Food at hotel/bars was very good. Only downside for appartment was the decor, TV channels in English and no small oven to cook a pizza for the kids, as in other self catering I have stayed.  There is a job and fridge/microwave etcprovided. Staff were helpful. It is  close to other restaurants about a 10 min walk up the hill. I would definitly consider returning in the future. I would give the hotel & staff 5star but our apartment 4 star."
Aug 2017,40,Great for families ,"We stayed for 7 nights in the apartments & were pleasantly surprised by the size of them, plenty big enough for the 4 of us & well equipped. Decor is tired in places but it was clean, if you have a pushchair ask for a ground floor apartment - bit of a pain dragging a stroller up & down the stairs.There are a few restaurants just outside the hotel which were very family friendly & a few supermarkets close by too.The resort has several pools, water quite chilly though! Plenty of sun loungers & parasols although a few are in need of repair. Bar near main pool was ok but massively over priced in my opinion. Had lunch several times at Atlantico bar just near the steps down to the beach, reasonably priced but busy. Had dinner in the Santa Eulalia restaurant one night which was very good but quite expensive.Bus into town is very popular so arrive early if you want a seat although a taxi is only 7 euro's.Staff we encountered were friendly most of the time.I wouldn't rate this as a 5 star resort, it's good though & very family friendly. My son  enjoyed the kids club activities especially the family party.This resort needs smartening up in places, better bars/restaurants & improvements to pool area to warrant a 5 star rating.Definitely recommend it for families with small children."
Aug 2017,40,Family holiday,"Fantastic holiday! Would absolutely recommend this for family especially to stay in the villa/apartments. Food, facilities, staff, mood and atmospherics were second to none. A little bit more for children and this would be a excellent rating however there is plenty to do and see for children that it doesn't matter a great deal. Book this hotel for your next holiday if you are flirting with the idea of the Algarve."
Aug 2017,50,Overall it was good.,"Everything was excellent but I wish I had a coffee making facilities in the room, so I don't need to call the room service all the time. Also room carpets could been better. I liked the bus service to the local town."
Aug 2017,40,Great holiday a good 4*,Stayed here at beginning of August and overall we were very happy with our stay.  We stayed in the Hotel and yes must agree with lots of other reviewers the rooms certainly need a makeover to achieve a 5* review.  Rooms were clean overall despite a few stains here and there and were comfortable and cool which was SO needed given the temperatures!! We only had breakfast and yes it was a very busy but despite the numbers catered for we thought they do a good job overall.  Breakfast was like any other 5* we have stayed in plenty of choice  and good quality.BUT our biggest niggle of all was the sunbeds - they are SO uncomfortable. Bare beds with no cushions which 5* establishments should have.  However in peak season there was no shortage of beds.Bus service to old/new town great to have but you need to get to stop early to ensure a seat.Overall we would stay again because this hotel has what lots of other 5* hotels do not have and that is the location location location.  It is amazing. Worth spending few euro extra for seaview.  We felt like we had a holiday and came away feeling relaxed.
Aug 2017,40,Family hotel - be prepared to be surrounded by kids ,"We stayed in the hotel with my boyfriend. The place offers good value for money, but the food definitely falls short of a 5 star hotel standard. I would recommend to make sure you pick a room with a sea view, otherwise you will be seeing a car park from your balcony. The resort is big  and has a lot of people staying here and a lot of kids everywhere you go. It is close to he beach. The SPA offers thalassotherapy, which it actual quite good.  I would not recommend this to couples and it is not very romantic ."
Aug 2017,50,Best of holidays,"Beautiful hotel with amazing views. Clean and well maintained . Attentive reception and housekeeping service . Kids enjoyed activities and choice of restaurants . Well located . Beach set up is great . Hassle free holiday. Big beds 2 bedroom suite has 1 enormous bed ,1 double sofa bed suitable for 2 kids below10. 2 bathrooms and 2 balconies . This works well ."
Aug 2017,50,"Excellent, a real 5 star vacation!",A top vacation in a real 5 star hotel. The location and the kindness/promptness of the staff very good! A small delay at the check-in but Joao handled very good! Thanks for the drinks and the SPA treatment! Will definitively return!
Aug 2017,40,not a five star hotel.,"the rooms were basic, certainly not five star, the tiles in the bathroom were broken and the rooms even though they were clean they really need an up grade. our room looked out on the car park. Breakfast was very good but it was like a scrum in a rugby match sometimes. We booked two treatments in the spa, my husband had a full price treatment costing 75 euros and i was delighted to get a special offer facial for 55 euros total 130.00 euros. We were really annoyed though because i was not allowed use the sauna/steam room because my treatment was on offer whereas he was allowed use the sauna/steam because he paid full price. I tried to argue that we could both have full price treatments for 40 euros each total 80.00 euros and we could both use the facilities but NO was the answer. I felt it was very cynical and mean spirited. We will not be returning."
Aug 2017,40,4 star,"Hotel is certainly not 5 star as advertised. We stayed in self catering apartments with 2 kids. Loads of space and cleaned everyday (spotless), decor probably not to many folks taste. Pool we were next to was nice size and usually found a bed no bother. Beach is accessed via hotel but is not private. The beach in August was completely full so don't expect a relaxed beach. Food and drink at the hotel is mega expensive but there is nearby supermarkets. Found the hotel to be lovely but not 5 star, solid 4 star."
Aug 2017,40,Rest and Relaxation,"Spent a thoroughly enjoyable 10 days at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort in early August. We had a first floor room with a wonderful sea view.  Although the room décor is a bit dated we had everything we needed - the bed was very comfortable and, due to the heatwave, the AC was great. The bathroom did, however, occasionally smell of drains which wasn't the nicest.We only used the main restaurant, the main pool bar and the beach café - all were fantastic.  Lots of choice at buffet meal times in the main restaurant and both the pool and beach bars had decent menus with snacks/salads to choose from.  Wide selection of drinks and smoothies too! Lovely to have the waiter service round the pool but not so nice to have our towels/belongings removed while we sat at the pool bar for lunch one day.  There is a policy (one small sign showing this at the bar) that the staff reserve the right to remove towels from loungers after a 30 minute period. While I appreciate and understand the need to reduce folk reserving sunbeds I do think the 30 minutes is an unreasonably short period.  I did hear quite a few other guests complaining about their towels/belongings being taken and we had only moved to the bar table for a quick lunch but were still targeted.  We did manage to recover our things and keep our sunbeds but it meant we didn't move again for the rest of the trip and either had lunch delivered to the sunbed or left the area entirely.All that aside this resort is absolutely wonderful and a stones throw from a spotless beach.  The rooms were cleaned daily and all the staff were polite and friendly. We managed to connect to WiFi around the pool and also in our room.  We also took the free bus into Albufeira a few times to experience a more upbeat scene.  There wasn't much entertainment in the evening (a singer and guitarist mainly) and dancers on one occasion.Overall I loved it though and would definitely go back."
Aug 2017,40,Nice apartments,Great location and right on the beach. Apartment was nice and next to the pool. Some great restaurants directly outside the hotel and within walking distance. Hotel staff in general excellent especially at our pool bar and the maid was brilliant nothing to much trouble. Main hotel bar and gourmet burger bar staff quite dismissive. Beach bar had to pay cash or credit card - no problem and staff were great with DJs on every night great vibe. Had to pay for beach sunbeds - again no problem  as guys were great. Generally hotel needed an eye for detail - we would stay again as location and apartments were what we liked but attention to detail and 5 star rating need looked at.   Big bonus is no matter what time you arrived at or pool always managed to get a sunbed and brolly even at 13.00 so no issue there . Would  recommend  but don t set your expectations to high.
Aug 2017,30,Not for us - not 5*,"Just returned from our stay at the Grande Real. While there were some things we liked - good location, lovely, clean rooms, good food at the burger restaurant and the Santa Eulalia Beach restaurant - this is clearly nowhere close to 5* elsewhere. While staff was friendly the impression we had is that a lot of staff had no formal training - seemed to be interns. At the makeshift kids club in the conference rooms, staff was more busy chatting with each other or staring at their laptops instead of looking after children. Have to ask 5 times for the check. Staff do not speak English very well. Pool chairs were snatched up early morning already by eager beavers reserving them with their towels and did then not return all morning - no one cares despite policy in place. Breakfast is underwhelming. It's not a bad hotel overall but does not live up to its advertisement."
Aug 2017,30,"Great place, but terrible service.","We have been on previous occasions many times and always had a great time. However, this time the service was slow and of a poor standard everywhere and at times almost rude (reception, bars, restaurants, room service) They just didn't seem bothered and no sign of any overseeing management to resolve or see the problems."
Aug 2017,40,GRSERand Spa,Pleased with hotel but concerned that wheelchair users aren't fully catered for. The hotel gives the impression that the beach and all restaurants are wheelchair accessible. This is most certainly not the case.
Aug 2017,20,Week with family,"As you enter this hotel, it has all the airs and graces of a 5* hotel. However, it has a spa and this seems to be the passport to 5*. When you scratch beneath the surface it does not rise to above 4*. The ambience and decoration of the hotel is fabulous, and the staffing is incredible. However, so many things were so disappointing. We booked for half board as we had our two grandsons aged 3 & 7 with us. The food for the children was appalling. Very limited choice. That would not have been a problem if what was offered was well cooked. The chips offered were hard, dry and cold. I paid 30 euros per night for my 7 year old grandson and he barely ate anything.The breakfast restaurant was like feeding time in a zoo. We sat outside on a beautiful terrace, but the continuous long treks into a self service restaurant wore me out. I asked for a tray to bring drinks/ food  out but was refused it. Breakfast food was frequently run out and the bread for toast was stale.There was insufficient sun beds as there outsiders who came to the pool area as well as guests from the sister hotel who didn't have enough sun beds. Due to the outsiders creeping in through a security gate my grandsons inflatable shark was stolen.It's such a shame as the situation of the hotel is fabulous and I'm sure that May/June and September is wonderful but this hotel can't cope with the number of people during the school summer holidays.Staff were wonderful but over worked."
Aug 2017,50,Fantastic,This was our second year at Grand Real Albufeira. We loved it first time and more the second time. Kids loved it too. Right on the beach. And it was a great beach. Loads of pools to chose from. I can't say anything negative about this hotel. We'll probably go again next year.
Aug 2017,50,8 night stay in August 2017,"We stayed 8 nights and really enjoyed everything. I would definitely recommend this hotel, good price/quality ratio. Dinner at Cozinha restaurant is good option, wide range of really good quality of food for an acceatable price. The salty water pool is excellent and not too crowded. The only 2 minuses would be the fact that on the beach we had to pay extra for the sunbeds (would expect that to be free at a 5 star hotel's beach) and the queue at breakfast which We didn't understand the reason for."
Aug 2017,50,Amazing hotel.,My son and I had an amazing 10 day holiday at this beautiful resort. The staff were always very well presented and most were friendly. Room was clean with stunning views. Breakfasts were excellent and delicious.
Aug 2017,50,"Friendly, quiet, relaxing","My wife found this hotel based on its tripadvisor rating, and I have to say I was impressed. The hotel is well laid out with multiple pool areas and bars, with none of the crowding (or noise) that I have experiences elsewhere. The rooms were kept immaculately clean, and the apartment that we had was a great size for a family of 4. A nice beach plus several on site restaurants are supplemented by some local restaurants that are also very good quality (Portabello and Martins). There is no supermarket / mini market on site but turning right out of the main entrance there is a small minimarket called Fatimas that has the essentials and more.I can honestly say that I would return to this place. Its far enough away from the new town / old town to be quiet, but easy to walk / bus / car should you want to leave this little oasis."
Aug 2017,40,nice hotel - a good 4* but not 5 star for me - Family suite room - end July 17,"My wife, son and i stayed here 23 july to 3rd August 17This is a really nice hotel the pool area is really nice with several pools scattered across the complex, good sunbeds and a 1minute walk to the public Santa Eulalia Beach.(this beach is not exclusive to the hotel)The beach has water sport activities you can pay for but isnt part of the hotel. nice sandy beach intermingled with quite a few stones.We stayed in a Family suite and you need to know that if you stay in the main hotel, rather than the appartments which are predominately separate in the grounds there are 2 floors of rooms below reception. The room we had was on floor -1 despite asking for a sea view we just had trees out the back and could only see them! the family suite has two bedrooms one with two singles together as a double and the other had a double sofa bed. 2 bathrooms and quite spacious. Each bedroom had its own balcony and the view of the trees was lovely. the decor in the rooms were a bit dated and in need of a refurb, the bathrooms were pretty poor for a 5* hotel and have had much better bathrooms in lower star hotels. TV in both rooms and sitting area, Minibar is stocked but charged for what you use. The carpets were pretty filthy and in need of a real good clean. The hotel is located quite a long walk (at least 25 mins) up to the more lively areas, although there are a couple of restraunts next to the hotel we tried 2 of them and thought they were pretty average.On an evening there were singers in the bar area but tbh they were pretty rubbish and the bar area has little or no atmosphere. Much better to get a cab or the shuttle bus to the 'Strip' or 'old town' Albufeira.example prices we paid were 5euro per large beer (slightly smaller than a pint), 8euro for jack daniels and 2.50 for coke making it 10.50 for a JD and coke. Glenlivit 12 year malt single measure was 15euro.... We had bed and breakfast and the breakfast was exactly the same every day (we were there for 10 days). omelettes are available on request. Hot breakfast options are streacky bacon, local sausage, fried eggs (they will do poached on request), boiled eggs, mushrooms tomato, hash brown, scrambled egg, toast cereals juice tea and coffee fruit and continental breakfast type food. lots of choice.staff were very pleasant, professional and helpfulThis is a nice hotel as i said and if you like a quite time perfect, but if you like it a bit more lively probably not for you.Clientel was a mix of europeans with lots of british and irish staying.Kids activities are probably good for younger kids but not a lot for teenagers upwards."
Aug 2017,50,Hotel Santa Eulalia portugal,"Excellent hotel very clean lovely staff would definitely be returning next year, would recommend this hotel to anyone great family place, children's club great the girls did a marvellous job keeping small children occupied"
Aug 2017,50,Lovely hotel in a lovely location,"Had a great time, the hotel and staff were very helpful, no queuing for sun loungers as towels were removed by staff if they were left unattended for long periods, we were HB and given meal vouchers to use as and when we wanted, which was very helpful if we wanted to have lunch and go out in the evening. I would definitely come back and stay in this hotel again. The hotel provides a bus shuttle to the old town, which is brilliant, plenty going on there for all ages."
Aug 2017,50,hfg travelor,Very nice location and good quality for everything.Some pools has little bit deeper for small children but location and that size are very suitable. The restaurant are also good for food quality and variety.Hotel staff are very kindness.
Aug 2017,50,Fab place,I love it! We had an amazing stay for 7 days self catering. All staff very friendly and helpful. Only downside is price on resort - pop just outside gates for variety and better price. Brilliant holiday can't wait to come back. Fabulous
Aug 2017,50,Would return and recommend,"We stayed here with our 2 children in a one bedroom apartment. The apartment was clean and spacious. There were 2 separate sofa beds in the living area (1 double 1 single) so the kids didn't have to share! The air con worked well and wasn't noisy, the shower was decent, beds comfortable and the apartment was cleaned to a high standard every day. The resort itself was quiet and the other guests we encountered pleasant not rowdy. The beach next to the resort is lovely. The location was great for us as it's not that close to Albufeira so not noisy at night.Would recommend Martins restaurant and Portobello pizzeria just outside the resort. We did not use the hotel buffet restaurant in the evening as it seemed very expensive.A recommendation would be more parasols around the pool area as there weren't enough in relation to the sun loungers.Overall a great holiday and would return to this resort. I would recommend for couples and families."
Aug 2017,40,Couple retreat,"Very good four star, not five as hotel is starting to look a little tired. Very good all roundund hotel and location, great beach on doorstep. Staff friendly, breakfast layout bit hectic with so many guests could be laid out more efficiently."
Aug 2017,30,Overpriced,"We stayed in the apartments and as a family of 4 with 2 teenagers it felt quite cramped. The kitchen area was very basic with folding doors to close it off that we had to wedge open with a chair. We found the staff to be helpful yet non engaging. There was one cleaning lady who would wave and smile when you saw her which is the most interaction we saw with any of the staff. The bonus side to 5star was clean linen, towels, toiletries and daily cleaning. And not to forget constant air conditioning."
Aug 2017,30,Policies not adhered too,"While our stay at the hotel was good other things let it down, we have stayed at many 4 and 5 star hotels in portugal and they all had tea and coffee making facilities in the room where this hotel does not.There is not enough seating on the terrace outside the bar you can probably seat around 20 people and thats it. The cooked breakfast was cold all 7 mornings we were there, no heaters under the food trays just a normal light bulb shining on it, after 4 days of cold fried eggs and beans i gave up and had fruit.The hotels policy regarding the pool and sun beds are a joke, i stood at the side one day and counted around 170 sunbeds but there was only 64 people in and around the pool, the policy states if sunbeds are left for more than 30 minutes staff will remove your belongings, this never happened once in the week we were there. one irish family of 6 put towels on 6 sunbeds at 09:30 and did not return to them till 3 o clock in the afternoon, just a joke. Joke policy No2, they say no inflatables in the pools, but both pools ( which are far too small ) had children and adults playing on them, please correct your policies and stop giving false information."
Aug 2017,50,Great hotel views and beach,Great views to lovley sandy beach perfect for families accessed via key card. Rooms have great beds for all which is sometimes an issue with family hols and air con is fab. Lots of pools for no early start to get sun beds ;) animation team could do with more ra ra and family activities we hardly knew they were there. Free shuttle bus to old and new town (old better for families) all in all fab hol we'll be back
Aug 2017,50,Great for kids,Lovely holiday with family including grandchildren. Great breakfast choice. Helpful staff. Nice pool areas. Rooms a bit dated but clean. Handy bus in to town. Sandy beach is easy to access. Good kids club.
Aug 2017,50,Fantastic hotel for services and unwinding,"The staff in this hotel were fantastic from checking in to checking out nothing was no much trouble for the staff. The access to pools, beach, drink and food was so accessible making my stay uncomplicated and relaxing."
Aug 2017,30,Just 'okay' really hotel,"The problem you have when you state that you're a five star hotel, then if you aren't  your guests are generally disappointed. If this place had said four star, or three star then you know what you're going to get and it can exceed your expectations. However, when you say you're a five star and the reality is it probably lies somewhere between 3 and 4 star you disappoint.So that's sort of where this review comes from. Everything about this hotel is just okay. The bar, the gym (quite a lot of broken equipment), the rooms. We stayed in the apartments and my daughters had a room in the hotel. The room in the hotel was significantly better (at least more modern) than the apartments which were dated. They all need a big refurb. The pool at the hotel was very small and very cold, so you had the rather odd sight of everyone going in the kids pool instead because it was warmer. The pool around the apartments was better and less busy.Breakfast was underwhelming. Thankfully we only stayed three nights because much more than that with, what can only really be described as limited selection, would have been frustrating.The hotel is in a decent location, it's right on the beach and it's close enough to Albufeira if you wanted to go in, but far enough away for privacy.The best meals we had were actually at the fish restaurant on the beach O Pescador which sort of says everything about the hotel.If you're genuinely looking for a five star hotel in the Algarve there are much better options."
Aug 2017,40,"Great location, superb staff,  pools and kids club average","Positive: location, staff, dinner buffet,  rooms Average: pool size, breakfast,  distance to the beach from the apartements,  kids club (located in the conference rooms it all seems a bit improvised; plus staff is too young and doesn't really know how to deal with smaller kids)"
Aug 2017,50,Fantastic family friendly resort,"We stayed in the resorts apartments which are set back from the main hotel. The room was in effect a large bedsit style set up so a large room with double bed, living room/dining area and kitchenette and balcony. Separate bathroom. Suitable for one or two younger children. Not so sure I would want more than one teen in the room though. The children's club is fantastic with plenty of timetabled activities from 10am to around 8pm and the children's club staff were amazing. I'm always a little wary (over protective!) leaving my youngest child with strangers but the team were so obviously caring I was not at all concerned. The pools were sufficient maybe a bit on the small side for the number of guests peak season. Because of this I would advise avoiding the main pool area (so so busy) and going to the ones nearer the apartments. The beach is nice and only a short stroll from the hotel. The 4 on site restaurants were lovely. The gym and spa area well equipped. The bus shuttle service into Albufeira was run regularly around 1 bus every 1 or 2 hours there and back from 10am until gone 6pm everyday. I've read a lot of people complain that the hotel is not 5 star, but not all countries use the same hotel star grading system as the UK or some other EU countries, so no this is not exactly a UK 5 star but it is the same quality as other Portugese 5 star hotels I've stayed in and it's (roughly) a good UK 4 star hotel (in my opinion) and it is priced accordingly."
Aug 2017,40,Good location hotel,Stayed here in July. Hotel was in a good location with friendly staff. Food was good with a good selection. Pool was nice and plenty of sun loungers. Would definitely recommend this hotel for families.
Aug 2017,50,25/07/17-01/08/17,"Had a wonderful week with my family, staff were lovely and polite. My son is deaf and the staff noticed and came to me and  introduced  them selves and told me they knew sign  language and if I was going to use the kids club he would be safe and able to communicate with them, I thought it was lovely thing to do and made him feel welcome. My son used it a few times and had a great time. Rooms were cleaned very well on daily basis. Only used there restaurant for breakfast and was always greeted politely and food was lovely. Also food at swimming pool bar was also very nice & fresh. Main bar always had a singer in the evening and children could join in. Staff were lovely at the main bar spent most nights there after our dinner. The bed was massive and so  comfy going to miss how much room I had. Was very pleased with our stay and wish we had stayed longer"
Aug 2017,30,Not 5 star,Had a lovely holiday here but not suitable for disabled or infirm as the beach is way down needs a cable car..hotel is not 5 star but has 5 star prices ...disappointed in not being able to use sundowners bar as it was closedBreakfast good but always cold The other restaurants on the complex have good foodBeds great !Rooms cleaned daily by lovely ladies ..please leave them a tip !Not much entertainment
Aug 2017,40,Amazing resort but food and distance an issue,"We had a studio apartment which was a gorgeous room with all the amenities. We also had a pool right outside our door so we didn't have to trek to the main pool at the hotel which was a huge plus. However, the food is not great and it is really overpriced. Twice we had to send back burgers that were cold and we were barely offered an apology. Along with that, we are a young couple so found it was a bit far away from the buzz of either strip. The shuttle buses are great, but make sure you are queuing up half an hour before the bus is due because it gets really busy.Along with that, the nearest spar is 15 minute walk (feels like 30 minutes) so be prepared if you want to get basics for your room.All in all, I would definitely stay again but I would probably prefer to drive."
Aug 2017,30,Grande Real Santa Eulalia,"The hotel is ok with enough parking space, swimming pool is rather small and crowded. The Beach is not part of the hotel, beds on the beach need to be paid for. Our room was next to the emergency exit of which the door slammed every time someone used it. I think its over priced."
Aug 2017,40,Very good but too expensive,Map of the hotel absolutely unreadable. Free bottle of wine in extra pay restaurant (when you missing your free diner) absolutely rubbish. Too much restaurant and bars are announced but actually only few are independent (not belong to others)!Price of the hotel is overstated!!!
Aug 2017,40,family holiday,"Great family place with plenty for kids to do. Large size kids club. Self catering apartment was of good size and seating area outside. The shuttle service to towns had a maximum of 27 passengers and on occasions some people did not get on and taxis always at least a half hour wait and cannot be booked in advance. The reception staff did not understand everything in English and often our questions were not answered properly even when rephrased. We asked other guests some questions instead! We enjoyed our stay and would consider returning. Family of 4, children aged 5 and 7."
Aug 2017,40,Happy Holidays,Just returned from a week at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia with my wife and 2 year old daughter. We had a great relaxing holiday. The hotel facilities are good and the 1 bed apartments are comfortable.
Jul 2017,30,Not quite 5*,"Having been lucky enough to stay in some beautiful 5* hotels I was slightly disappointed by this hotel. I'd say it could be classed as a good 4* but not 5 for the following reasons -Service - generally staff did not go out of their way to help like I've previously experienced in 5*. The reception desk requires some work - not very welcoming and we weren't advised about any of the services on check in. We only found out about the kids facilities when we stumbled upon them almost a week into our holiday. However there were a few exceptions - some of the breakfast staff were great and also the bar man in evenings. Rooms - rooms are nice and bed really comfy with great air conditioning but no tea / coffee / kettle and an awful hairdryer is definitely not 5* standard. The robes are also poor quality and shower is dated - shower curtains instead of glass! Also usually in 5* resorts you get fresh water each day. The chocolate on your pillow is nice but if that can be replaced each day I'd expect water in the room to be provided daily too. Restaurants - food was lovely and lots of selection however restaurant opening times 7pm is a little late when you're on holiday with a 15 month old, albeit I appreciate that is personal to us and most people do dine later on holiday. Only one restaurant opened earlier but was mainly burgers. Couldn't fault the food though! The hotel is lovely and has lots of nice points. It's a bit away from the main areas of Albufeira but generally a nice resort, just in my opinion not 5*."
Jul 2017,50,Top notch! Would definitely go back!,"Stayed here mid July and was pleasantly surprised... the room was lovely although the decor was dated a bit... however it didn't bother me what so ever. The beds were huge and the kids had their own beds as well.... we all slept well! The pool we used was fantastic, always a subbed available and liked the fact there was a child's pool too. The snack bar was great and you could charge the food and drinks to the room to save having cash. Activities during the stay were good... I even took part in some volleyball! Staff were super friendly and helpful. We liked the fact we got chauffeured to our room via golf buggy! He kids loved it! Ha ha! The only thing I would say is that you have to travel or walk a bit to get to a local supermarket if self catering etc, but the hotel does have a free shuttle bus to both the old and new town of albufeira. We used this a lot, but also, taxis back were cheap too. Thank you for a great holiday, we will return!"
Jul 2017,30,A little disappointed,Stayed in appt family 5.  No washing machine in appt or on site. Laundry service very expensive.  Kids club activities very poor for age 10 and 12 yrs. all activities for a lot younger.  Even events advertised like dancing were just following PlayStation.  Entertainment staff very nice but events very poor.  Funny smell in spa changing area . I found bed in apt very hard .  Cleaned very well every day
Jul 2017,40,Another relaxing holiday BUT ..................................,"Another great family holiday at the Grande Real, last stayed here 10 years ago and i can honestly state that the hotel is still very good, what would make it excellent is better entertainment at night (The duet on the 24th July - at the Pergula restaurant were exellent but that was it for us.I think the hotel is looking like it needs a maintenance check from the main sign of the hotel to the accomodation but as a venue its still very good for a family holiday and if you just want to stay around the pool and chill out then you will find this hotel ticks all the boxes - for self catering the little family run supermarket just up the road does the best coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice in the area and provides all daily requirements.Wth a number of offsite and on-site restaurants you have plenty of choice for your meals. A Great location for families."
Jul 2017,50,portugal,good overall location for local bars and restaurants and supermarkets nice and clean hotel complex with friendly staff and my kids loved the kids club not much entertainment at night tho could do with more access to the pool area we had to walk to the reception area eveytime we wanted to use the pool or outside areas
Jul 2017,50,Great getaway stay,Excellent service and friendliness as expected from most Portuguese Hotels. The food was great although there were few 'local' options which was disappointing.A beautiful area and an amazing beach with great leisure facilities.
Jul 2017,20,5* Hotel rating not warranted,"Never ever again. The only thing grand about this hotel is in the name. This definitely does not warrant its 5* rating. Their seems to be little effort to ensure guests have an enjoyable and relaxed holiday.Our Room –No Slippers – No Make up/Shaving Mirror(despite being shown in photos) – No Coffee/Tea making Facilities – No Light in Shower – Lighting in Bathroom poor – Sink Cracked – Granite Sink surround well worn and marked -  Air con - unable to adjust temperature – No Full length mirror – Ments trousers hangers were missing bottom rails and small sharp nails were sticking out risking damage to clothes. Crumbs remained on Carpet even after room being cleaned – A number of Stains on Carpet Breakfast Room – All buffet service – collect own Tea and Coffee from vending machine – Breakfast almost cold, bacon greasy and oily – A tray of fried eggs disappeared as soon as plated and were virtually cold – Only 1 person cooking on the griddle not sufficient for a 240 room hotel plus apartments in full season, unable to cope  – Very busy, jostling and queuing for food was the norm – Various items constantly run out inluding Bacon, Eggs, Chocolate Croissants, Sponge Cake and fresh Orangs Slices – Waiters telling us tables are taken when nobody was sitting there – Service was abysmal from waiters trying to take cups of fresh cups of coffee and tea and snatching plates that were still being used –  not asked if we were finished and leaning rudely across usAdult Pools near main Hotel – 1 Salt Water – 1 Fresh Water – The first week this pool was hot enough for a bath.- Despite notices for no ball games or Lilo’s or any other inflatables, no body to enforce this – pool was crowded, impossible to swim in – Sun loungers were hard and some were broken – the 1 towel each only covered half the lounger and requesting 2 more had to leave 30 euros deposit – This was still being charged for on departure despite returning them. Credit card was required before being able to have items on tab from the pool bar, otherwise cash only. Beach access was direct from Hotel, a public beach, cost 15 euros per day for 2 loungers and parasol – Our unopen umbrella was snatched from us without asking and had to chase after the person to get another one, no apology – One parasol one day had big holes in it   Overall service was very poor, staff often rude. On departure we had to bring down our own cases. As we left early on the last day we were unable to have breakfast and had nothing eat or drink until we reached the airport. The photos on the website are better than the real thing and not a true reflection. The reality is this Hotel has some has a number of issues to address and in places certainly needs updating. Overpriced, Overated and not value for money."
Jul 2017,50,Excellent family holiday,"Excellent holiday enjoyed by us all.  Very relaxing, spotlessly clean, apartment sufficient for our needs, cleaners in every day providing high standards, lovely restaurants.  Beach was not private and was a little disappointed to find that we had to ""rent"" the beds like everyone else. Last Shuttle bus of the evening is 7:20pm which was too early for us.  Another couple of buses running through to 9pm would have been ideal.  Weather was beautiful! Will definitely visit again😀"
Jul 2017,50,Brilliant for family holiday ,"We stayed for 10 days as a family of four in July 17. Great service, lovely range of food for all tastes and a choice of pools and beach as well as trips. Hot weather but air con in rooms - all good.  Highly recommend."
Jul 2017,40,Great Hotel,"This hotel really is beautiful, the photos on websites do not do it justice and makes it seem old fashioned, but it is not at all, great views of the sea, felt very spacious and clean.Me and my Boyfriend stayed here in the hotel for one week in July, we loved the hotel grounds, the room, and the food was nice. We were half board and decided to use it at lunch as we wanted to go out and about in the evenings, lunch was like a BBQ with fresh meat & fish, lots of salads etc it was really nice. If possible we would recommend going half board for the extra as to dine at the hotel was pretty expensive and you would probably be better off paying for half board. Also try and get breakfast included or that can work out very expensive at the hotel, breakfast was very nice and had pretty much everything you would want. Every Wednesday throughout July & August they have opened the sunset bar and provided a DJ, this was great to sit and have a drink and watch the sun go down.We found Albuferia itself a little bit tacky, the old town much better than the new town, the hotel offers free bus service a few times a day and a taxi back was only around 7-10 euros. We would recommend Vilamora which is 20euros in a taxi but really nice restaurants and bars. We also took a walk to O'hlos D'agua which is a 20-25 min walk right from the hotel, there are some nice local restaurants and bars there if you fancy a change from busy Albufeira. We found the drinks at the hotel pretty expensive, 4euros for a large bottle of water, only 1.80euros at the supermarket down the road. Cocktails around 7euros and a large beer (not a pint) was 4euros, 3euros for smallsoft drink at the pool bar, but the beach bar seemed to be a little bit cheaper. They also offer happy hour, but we found whenever we went to pay on happy hour they didn't knock it off we had to keep reminding them. Some of the staff could have been a bit more friendly, some were lovely but some did not even smile at us when we said morning. The beach is beautiful and clean, but you would expect at a 5* hotel you would not be expected to pay for beds at the beach, it should be included. It was 15euros a day for 2 beds and umbrella, we did pay this as we love the beach.Around the pool there are lots of sun beds and did not feel cramped, very spacious and also got a bed. All in all we had a fantastic time, but like a lot of the reviews the service is probably more 4* than 5*. We would return but maybe if we hired a car so that we could visit more places around the Algarve,"
Jul 2017,30,Nice hotel but not amazing,"We applied for a self catering suite but were not provided with a hob or cooker, which was disappointing. So we ate in the restaurants around Albufeira which was very nice. Bed was rather hard but ok for a short stay. When the staff came to clean our room the towels were not replaced, we then told reception who did not do anything about it. Bar is very nice and drinks were good prices. The pool was also very nice. The location was amazing with a local supermarket nearby and also a lot of restaurants. The beach was a 10 minute walk away, also recommend taking a cab to the old town. Very beautiful and it also has an amazing beach. The strip is also nearby which is great for a night out."
Jul 2017,30,Not a five star hotel,"The hotel is in need of a big renovation. Bathrooms are very outdated with rust stains, sinks don't drain properly. Beds and pillows are uncomfortable. Outdoor pools are very small and crowded. To use the indoor pool you have to pay - I have never seen it anywhere!Hotel doesn't have its own beach, you have to use public beach and pay for the beach chaises. Beach is very crowded too.Some hotels provide complementary teas and drinking water - here there is no drinking water anywhere, you need to buy it.WiFi is very slow.Room service was also very slow - 40 min to get a sandwich.The best feature of this hotel was employees, everybody was very helpful and friendly."
Jul 2017,50,Relaxing Quality Holiday,"Excellent holiday, so relaxing. Was a family holiday with plenty to do for my 8 year old son without the madness of the usual package holidays. Evening in the hotel was so relaxing beautifully served drinks and relaxing music"
Jul 2017,50,Excellent hotel,First time staying at santa eulalia hotel and spar.  Was lovely clean hotel very spacious room looking over the pool area.  The staff were very polite and helpful nice clean bar lovely reception area to relax in.plenty of nice bars and restaurants just 100m down the road and ten min walk to the strip. Buses run every hour to the old town would highly recommend this hotel to friends and family and would stay there again in the future
Jul 2017,50,Super,"Excellent hotel. Our third stay. Food in the restaurant - we stayed half board - was cooked fresh, was piping hot, and varied. Cleanliness was immaculate throughout the hotel. We found staff to be very helpful. The kids popped in and out of kids club, and the staff there were multilingual and enthusiastic."
Jul 2017,50,great hotel for family,"amazing hotel, great facility specially if yu have kids. nice rooms, great service and food. very useful KIDS club. we stayed in the apartments, but there are normal rooms. plenty of pools and restaurants"
Jul 2017,50,Great holiday,Second visit to this hotel and had a great holiday.  Apartment good size and spotless.  Hotel staff very helpful and always available.  Atlantico restaurant very good with good view of the beach.   We will be back.
Jul 2017,30,Disappointing,Very disappointed with this hotel.  The only thing that was 5* was the prices of food and drink.  Most of the staff were not friendly or helpful. Complaining about broken toilet seat twice with never got repaired and had to report blockage at pool shower on 3 occasions before that got fixed.  Very disappointed in this hotel. Would not recommend.
Jul 2017,40,Family Getaway,"Its a great place to be for the family, we travelled together with our six year old son. There are many swimming pools, one of them heated which is great for the kids. The breakfast has a good variety. We had an apartment which had enough space and the kitchen was well equipped even though we never used it, its not a modern apartment but it has all you need. There is easy access to a nice beach. The check in process was excellent and the lady during the check in (don’t remember her name) took care of all our requests. We went half board and had the dinner buffet every day at the restaurant. Since we are vegetarian the manager Nelson Dias took special care and even arranged for a vegetarian main course every evening. Overall a great place to be with the family."
Jul 2017,50,fabulous resort,"Fab resort for our Elementz of Couture Trip. great views, great beach, great pools and the breakfast was great. the room was spacious. The hotel was very clean and transfers were straight forward. We really enjoyed our trip and the town is 10 minutes walk with lots of restaurants etc."
Jul 2017,40,Connollly family,"Generally a very clean,and well located resort.Staff are not  overly friendly but fairly helpful.Restaurants and bars a bit expensive.We were asked forE16 on arrival for a litre of milk! We settled for a glass at the bar for E4.It was 23.45."
Jul 2017,40,July 2017,"We have recently returned from a short stay at the Grande Real and we really did enjoy our stay. All the staff we came into contact with were lovely and the hotel itself we would highly recommend. The hotel itself is near the new town and the old town, but is far enough away that you don't feel too much in the hustle and bustle. The only let down for us was there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room but everything else was great!"
Jul 2017,50,A fabulous retreat from real life,"This is five star luxury and guests are treated so well.  Every member of staff is friendly, helpful and courteous.  The food is lovely, breakfast is wonderful, and the location is stunning.  The beds are some of the most comfortable I've ever slept in."
Jul 2017,30,Not a 5 star hotel,"We have just spent a week in this hotel and did have a nice break with our teenage kids (14,18 and 20) however I was disappointed with some aspects.  We had two seaview bedrooms which are a good size, were very clean and have a great view, beds were comfy and breakfast was good, however while the hotel is comfortable the decor is very tired and shabby in many areas - wallpaper peeling off bedroom walls, woodwork chipped and discoloured, bedroom carpets with a lot of stains, door stop in bedroom lifting out of carpet (trip hazard), dining room furniture very worn. Pool beds damaged, decking needing revamp, umbrellas old and tired. The overall impression was that reinvestment was needed to update the premises. Other than the very nice lady who cleaned our rooms staff were not particularly friendly or efficient. Several of the reception staff seemed to be young trainees which is fine, we all have to learn however for a supposed 5 star hotel service level and efficiency was poor and there was little friendly interaction with guests. The hotel offers a complimentary bus to Albuferia however it only operates 5/6 times a day with last bus at 7.20 and takes only 28 people. When the hotel is full the service is inadequate. When I supported another guest who was complaining about this at reception the guy on the desk was borderline rude and did not take on board the problem although he had to arrange eight taxis for the guests who failed to get on the bus. He asked sarcastically should he provide a bus for all 900 guests in the hotel!!!! Not what you expect from front of house in any hotel, certainly not in 5 star. Clearly this could be managed better. It is too far to walk to the old town but taxis are cheap and plentiful - we gave up on the hotel bus, not worth the hassle. My eldest son arrived unexpectedly to join us. To the hotels credit they accommodated this without any problem putting an additional rollaway bed into the room.Prior to arriving at Saint  Eulalia we spent a few days in a 5 star in Vilamoura which far exceeded the standards of Grande Real, perhaps this heightened our disappointment as we had been expecting similar high standards of service and surroundings. It is a nice hotel in a good location but needs to improve standards to remain a 5 star."
Jul 2017,40,Courtesy bus to the old and new town,"This is a lovely hotel. Although I don't think it is five star judging it on the food. The breakfast buffet is always cold. Even if you are up early when the food first arrives out, it is still cold. The hash browns are tough as old boots. There is a great choice though and definitely something for everyone. I visited in July and the hotel was extremely busy. For this reason the restaurant gets very hectic, and there are a lot of kids wandering about. Breakfast is not an enjoyable experience. The pool area is lovely but again it is very busy and not very relaxing. You can move the beds into the grass where it could be a little quieter. The sunbeds are not comfortable. There are plenty of umbrellas. There a pool towels available from the hotel at no charge. There is a little poolside bar, the coffee is not good, I did not eat here, so I can't comment.There is wifi available but it drops a lot when you are at the pool area, everywhere else it works perfect.The hotel put on a courtesy bus. The last one leaves the hotel at 19:20 which is very early to be ready to head out for dinner. On occasion the queue if people is far too long for the size of the bus so you end up having to get a taxi. I have stayed in other hotels in the Algarve and they would have a second bus, but this is not the case here.The lobby is very big and has comfortable couches. We requested a kettle for the room, which they gave us, but would not give us any cups for the room, so we bought some, so we could have a cup int he room.The hotel rooms are large and well equiped, we had a large balcony. The mini bar is empty so you can put your own stuff int he fridge, although it is quiet small so can't fit much.The bathroom has toiletries and a small hairdryer. The towels and bed linen is top quality. The beds and pillows are very comfortable. There is air con in the room which is definitely needed. The reception staff are lovely and extremely helpful. It was my birthday when I stayed and they arrived up to the room with a birthday cake and a bottle of sparkling wine which was very thoughtful and very much appreciated. The location is in Santa Eulalia, it takes about 15 minutes to walk into this little town. There are supermarkets and bars/restaurants here, but I would recommend travelling to the old town for the best choice of bars and restaurants.In all I had a very enjoyable stay here, at times the busyness was a little annoying but that can't be helped. If the hot breakfast was hot I would have given five stars."
Jul 2017,40,Family holiday,"A nice resort hotel just outside the new town with plenty to do for young families, including 4 pools and right on the beach.  Lots of in-house restaurants if you are meat/shellfish eaters. Friendly, helpful staff."
Jul 2017,40,Lovely relaxing holiday,"Lovely clean hotel with excellent room service and very friendly staff.  Would recommend this hotel to friends and family.  Self catering apartment was spacious, clean and more than comfortable.  Pools were lovely and easy access to the beach."
Jul 2017,30,"Enjoyed our stay, but not a 5*","We have recently returned from staying at this hotel. Our stay was pleasant enough, however, this is not a 5* hotel based on many other previous 5* we have stayed in. We stayed in a suite which was very spacious and kept clean daily. Breakfast was cold the second you walked back to your table. Lots of variety but needs to be kept hotter! The pool bar we found the staff to be under a lot of pressure and struggling to deal with that pressure at times if busy. Sometimes we would wait nearly 5 minutes to have to be served to say we would like to order a drink/sandwich. Pools - cannot fault, the children's pool was lovely and warm. Staffs at reception and the cleaners were pleasant enough and very helpful when we asked them anything. Kids entertainment - we had our 3 year old little boy with us and struggled to entertain him at times. Kids club wasn't great, was ok for the odd hour but not a great deal for them to do. Overall, for the price, we enjoyed our stay. Although, not sure we would ever return again. Would have no problem recommending the hotel to other people, however will state that it's more of a 4*."
Jul 2017,50,The real'deal.,"This is one of the best hotels we have stayed at over the last number of years. Very well kept hotel and grounds. Friendly and efficient staff. Rooms are very nice, well sized and maintained. Bed was very comfortable. Food was top notch for breakfast and evening meals. Buffet dinner was a little expensive at approx €30pp during the day. Main bar was very good and staff knew what they were doing. We stayed here for our honeymoon and were well looked after. Only recommendation I would give is that general spa pool entry for a hotel guest at €20pp for 1.5 hours is a little steep. If this was 3 hours or a little less it wouldn't have been as bad. We would have liked to have used the pool a few times but at €40 a time it wasn't going to happen. All in all a very good hotel. Will recommend to others."
Jul 2017,40,Starting to slip,What a shame you've done away with the poolside grill snacks. I'm afraid salads and sandwiches don't cut it especially at the prices quoted. The only on site alternative is the €29 buffet which is way overpriced. Unfortunately leaving this year with doubts as to whether we'll return. This certainly hasn't been the case over the last few years. ☹️☹️
Jul 2017,50,Great Resort,"We are here on holiday just now. First impression is good. A lovely lobby with lights suspended from Pyramid ceilings, a marble like staircase leading down to the restaurant and pool area and big comfy couches. Very clean throughout.The staff are friendly and attentive. We booked a sea view room which I would recommend. It had all that you would expect from a five star hotel. We had bed and breakfast only as we prefer going out at night to different places. The breakfast buffet has a good selection. One slight criticism is that the fried eggs and potatoes are left on an unheated platter and get cold quickly. Other than that very good. The pool area is nice. Fairly easy to get a sunbed, although the hotel does not appear to remove towels left for over half an hour unattended as they say they will. Our eight year old son attended the kids club regularly. I can't praise the staff enough. Lots for him to do and he made plenty of friends. Nice for us to get a break sometime too. Liked the bar area. Cocktails are around €8 which is reasonable. The hotel runs a courtesy bus in to Albufeira which we took advantage of.The Spa is also worth a visit and they had good deals on offer. Great massage.Would definitely come back here. Highly recommend."
Jul 2017,40,Holiday,"Hotel is lovely, lots of bars, restaurants and pools. Nice place away from the main bustle of town and very close to the beach. Comfy stay and tasty food on offer. Lots of activites and great band plays over the weekend.Staff are very attentive and professional, but the little things make me think this hotel should be 4*, not 5.Food is really expensive, so is the bar. Pool area very crowded in summer, with people 'reserving' sunbeds despite signs saying they shouldn't. No tea/coffee making facilities in the bedrooms, and a resort view literally means you will be looking at the car park. Despite the little things, everything was lovely, clean and fresh. Would stay here again but not in July or August."
Jul 2017,30,"good 4 starts, but not 5","What I liked: very good location, lobby very nicely designed, staff is very friendlyWhat I did  not like: the installation is a bit oldish, the two outdoor pools are very small and crowed,the breakfast it not at the level of 5* hotel - limited and not tastyFor me, it's a good 4*, but by no means 5*, and it's overpriced"
Jul 2017,50,Best hotel ever,This hotel is from another world. The staff can't do enough for you from the minute you arrive. The resort is so clean. Variety and quality of food is fantastic and I'm a fussy eater. Every facility you could wish for. The indoor pool was closed but the weather was brill so didn't need it. Booking for next year and taking extended family
Jul 2017,50,Hello,"Superb location, amazing beach, excellent food, maybe some more vegetables would be better. The entertainment team is great but maybe they can engage more the tourists ex pool exercises, animation. Thank you!"
Jul 2017,30,"Not Bad, Not Great","My fiancé and I got back yesterday after a 7 night stay here. I'd suggest this hotel would be classed as 3 star at current standards, it was probably 5 star 25 years ago.If you have kids, or do not mind kids running around all the time then this is a good hotel, otherwise if not I suggest you look elsewhere!LOCATION:The hotel is quite central, and short taxi rides to Vilamoura, Albufeira and a couple of other smaller strips containing plenty of bars and restaurants, so big plus on location..  The hotel offers a free shuttle bus into Albufeira but we used Uber -  prices seemed to be quite cheaper than standard taxis.PRICING:We had a standard bed and breakfast deal although we tried to upgrade to all inc, this option was not available, only full board at 59 euro pp. This did not include any drinks at all including coffees, soft drinks, alcohol. In the end we decided not to upgrade as we ate out a lot. If you did want to eat from the lunch buffet it was 29 euros pp and included one free drink. A coffee was 2.50 and a large bottle of water 4 euros.STAFF:Pretty faultless really. It isn't a dedicated poolside/beachside waiter service but you can call them over if you manage to. No staff present on the beach which isn't a problem but again it's all self serv.FACILITIES:Great facilities for kids, not much for adults. The snazzy looking rooftop terrace was closed off during our stay including the beach access from the terrace, so not sure what happened there. Spa and gym were great, I had a massage at the spa and used the gym a few times but to use the pool/thalassotherapy section it was 18 euros pp for 1 hour usage and 2 out of 6 of the 'therapies' were broken which was a shame. I used it a couple of times and it was okay - literally the only kid free section of the hotelDECOR:Really beautiful lobby and spa, corridors to the rooms and rooms themselves pretty standard.Look, this is my first ever review on TripAdvisor and felt the need to create an account after staying here! My partner and I travel a lot and stayed in a few 5 stars. But on this occasion we just couldn't agree with the rating! I think next time we will stick to adults only :) In a nutshell this hotel is nice enough and great for older couples and families."
Jul 2017,50,"Excellent hotel,great location on the beach,very clean and the staff are good. Definitely will go back.","Excellent hotel,great location on the beach,very spacious rooms reception area. Good sized pool area.Nice places to eat in the hotel. Friendly staff and lots of them.Breakfast was a good variety. A good 15 minute walk to the strip(new town) and 30 mins to the old town. Or use the courtesy bus provided at different times throughout the day we are definitely going back."
Jul 2017,20,Stephanie,"Good breakfast and that's about it.Dirty underware in our apartment on arrival, pool bar not open , no evening entertainment .This is a struggling 5 star , to many cut backs to be a 5 star .Worst evening meal I've ever had for €32 per person Definitely wouldn't recommend Sorry"
Jul 2017,50,Summer Holiday,Great resort with really superb service. We had a fantastic stay. Only small gripes were the bed being too hard and not enough umbrellas at the poolside. Would not let these small things put us off returning or recommending Grande real.
Jul 2017,50,Fantastic,"Just came back after staying here for a week and I had a wonderful timeWe stayed in one of the apartments which was spacious clean bright and we had fresh beds everyday as well as fresh bathroom towelsThe kitchen has all that you need for a weeks stay and the wifi worked the whole time we was there- an iron would have been good to have but not the end of the world.The TV only had the sky news channel a kids channel  and a film channel in English so if you go with kids it might be worth taking a portable DVD player to keep them occupied in the room.The air con was excellent and very much welcomed after a day on the beach!There isn't a shop on site for essentials for the room but there is a small supermarket 10 mins up the road which has bread milk and fridge items to stock up on and a 15 min cab ride will take you to the algarve shopping mall which has a big supermarket inside if you wanted to buy dinners to cook in the apartments as well as fresh fruits and vegetables The hotel was clean and the staff were all friendly and helpful The spa is worth a visit or 5 in my case & the treatments are all worth the money and again the staff were excellent - they also had 2 treatments half price as a July special :)There is a free bus service which takes guests to either the old or new town and also has a free return service back to the hotel at selected times And they provide golf buggy rides back and fourth to your apartments (but they are at most a 5 min walk away from the hotel!)There are plenty of pools to go to and we went to the polente pool most days which has a snack bar there for guests and plenty of sun bedsAsk macro to make a cocktail and he makes one to suit your taste, I highly recommend trying his own version of a gin mojito and Long Island ice teaThe resturants have beautiful food, the wait time is longer than here in the uk but the wait is worth it.We tried the Buffet resturant once for our evening meal and although the selection of food was astonishing the other restaurants seem to be on a higher level for taste and service.The buffet breakfast was completely different and we went every morning. :)The beach is on your doorstep and have plenty of sun beds, we had 3 sun beds and they cost 25 euros for the day but they have nice thick cushions on them and umbrellas so spending that was worth it, there is a shop on the beach which sells snacks and magazines/newspapers ,sun creams and bikinis and there's also the Atlantica resturant at the top of the stairs for lunch and drinks Overall it was a fantastic place to stay and I will be returning there again in the near future."
Jul 2017,50,Great stay,"We have  enjoyed the stay in this hotel very much. Location of the hotel with access to the beach, comfortable room, great service  in all the areas of the hotel offers excellent conditions for wellbeing and  relaxation."
Jul 2017,50,Plesantly surprised with the high standard,"The photos do not do it justice, was extremely pleased with the whole complex. Staff where very helpful and friendly, and our apartment was immaculate. The beach was only a 1minute walk down to, while the main pool area overlooked. Location was perfect for us, and the free bus service to the old town was a real plus, would have happily paid for this service. Would definitely return"
Jul 2017,50,Fantastic Family Holiday,"Lovely hotel in a gorgeous location, right on a safe beach. The giant waves in early July gave us hours of fun in the water. The pools were lovely, with plenty of loungers but more parasols would help, as people held them all day even if not using them. We travelled with older children and stayed in the hotel on a half board basis. We had a spacious 2 room suite with superb air conditioning, 2 bathrooms (one with jacuzzi bath) and 2 balconies. The bed was very large and comfortable, but the mattress on the pull out sofa bed was not great.The room was cleaned thoroughly every day. We ate in the buffet restaurant every night, and the quality and selection of food was exceptional. My daughter has a nut allergy which can make eating out abroad difficult but it couldn't have been easier here.The restaurant staff made sure that she had a selection of dinner options and always explained the menu to her. They took the time to greet her and check ingredients each evening, and this made it possible for us all to relax and enjoy our meals. In particular we have to thank Nelson for his assistance and interest in looking after her."
Jul 2017,30,Nice but some essentials missing,"We stayed at the hotel with a number of friends and family for a week in mid June 2017. We had booked one of the two bedroomed apartments for four adults and two children on a self catering basis.On arrival at the hotel, despite booking direct with the hotel, they had only booked the apartment for three adults and two children. Once I was able to prove the booking by showing the emailed booking confirmation the matter was resolved quickly but on arrival at the apartment we had to request additional bedding and towels from reception. The apartment itself was nice, clean and well decorated and the air conditioning was excellent.We were aware that two of the adults would be sleeping in the living area on a temporary bed but we were disappointed to find that the bed was a narrow pull out sofa bed which was not the most comfortable and was on an angle so that our heads were lower than our feet whilst sleeping.We also found that there were a number of basic items missing from the apartment that I would expect to be present. There was only one drinking glass, no iron or ironing board and no bottle opener. We had to ask reception twice for glasses and when I asked for a bottle opener I was told that room service would charge to bring one to the room so it would be better if I went to the bar in the main reception building and ask for one. This was a ten minute walk away and when I got there I had to wait 20 minutes as there was a queue at the bar. The television in the apartment had very minimal English channels which ordinarily would not have been an issue but the Wi-Fi did not work at all throughout the stay. This was irritating when trying to entertain two small children in the evening. We reported this to the reception and were told they would send someone to look at it but were then just told to re-enter the password which had no effect. On a couple of occasions we were left short of towels which was probably something to do with the initial error highlighted when checking in with a person being missed off the booking. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff were nice. The pool area was always well kept and apart from the Wi-Fi issue any problems were resolved."
Jul 2017,40,Very nice resort,We had a very pleasant stay at the apartment. Hotel and food were great.It will be nice to get an ATM machine at the hotel in order for guests not to have to take a taxi and get into the city for getting cash.
Jul 2017,30,Rooms need upgrading,The website is deceiving when deciding on room type.  Standard rooms in main hotel are outdated and need serious repair and upgrading. Dark and very old carpet. We looked at 5 rooms in main building before they offered the apartment. On the website standard appears nicer than apartments. Not true select apartment
Jul 2017,50,Excellent hotel!,"We found this hotel through Expedia. The hotel and facilities were superb, the bar with terrace had stunning views and very friendly, helpful bar staff. The restaurants (particularly Santa eulalia) were fantastic. Not an easy walk to old town etc but a free and prompt shuttle took us there from the hotel and hotel staff very helpful with calling taxis. Beautiful room, well air conditioned and kept very clean by the domestic staff, all very friendly. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel, we will certainly be returning!"
Jul 2017,30,Not worth the money,"This was classed as a 5 star hotel yet had no tea or coffe making facility in the room, in the uk a kettle is a mandatory thing for a hotel to be classed as 5 star establishment. We had to request a kettle and then go and get our own cups from the restaurant, this did not seem to go down very with the person looking after the restaurant. We could not check in before 4pm which was inconvenient as we arrived at lunchtime. The breakfast was average and did not vary during the week, the quality of the bacon and sausages left something to be desired. The breakfast layout is very congested and could be easily reconfigured to allow people to access the food from both sides of the self service area, people are always getting in each other's way. The television quality and choice of channels was poor, the BBC news channel was unwatchable due to the poor signal. The staff were mostly very helpful and attentive. There is lovely outside area with double sun loungers and nice views of the beach, but 50% of the time is was unavailable for use which was disappointing and the bar in this area was never opened. This is an expensive hotel but in our opinion it did not live up to the 5 star rating and did not feel like value for the money. We still had an enjoyable time as we were there with a great group of friends and made our own entertainment."
Jul 2017,40,Great stay,"Just spent 3 days, was an exceptional stay. Everything I loved about the hotel , the facilities the beautiful beach in front which we had access to. Cleanliness pools activity program. Shuttle service into the old and new town was a great little surprise. When I had read previous reviews I read a lot of complaints about the breakfast. We did not find a bun fight. But my husband did feel the food was cold and I must say the attitude of the waiters was rather sour. Otherwise we really enjoyed ourselves."
Jul 2017,50,Second Visit,"It is our second time to visit the resort. I think we will be visiting every year! We went full board this time and I must say we were really satisfied! Food was great. The location is really a deciding factor. Still within walking distance to shops, the resort is in a quiet location and with direct access to the beach. Having a child with autism, we have to find a place which is both enjoyable and within easy access to everything. Definitely recommended to families with special needs. My daughter really enjoyed it very much. She is so used to the resort now having visited last year she already developed her routine which is very important to her. We will definitely come back next summer and maybe for a longer stay. Maybe the only minor thing I can recommend is a change of pillow type. It is just a personal preference to have a firmer pillow. But definitely Grande Real will be our summer destination for the years to come!"
Jul 2017,50,Best family holiday ever!,"I stay away a lot in the UK and am used to good hotels. Usually abroad is not as good as uk hotel standards but this place was perfection! The kids club is absolutely amazing! The kids wanted to go, it was free and they do some amazing stuff which means you don't feel bad. I had to tell my kids not to go as much so I could see them!We had a resort view apartment which had a pool and bar right outside, it was great. Booked for next year before we got home!"
Jul 2017,50,Great holiday,"Visited for 10 nights in June 2017. Had a lovely time, hotel very clean, great breakfast. Kids spent most of the time in the pool.  Beach was very crowded and felt that €15 a day for 2 beds was pretty steep."
Jul 2017,30,Unimpressed ,"Our last day here and we would defo NOT be coming back. Definitely  NOT 5 star rating more 4. We stayed in a 2bedroom apartment which although very clean looked as though it  was decorated 20 years ago. On arrival check in was fast and our room was ready early. Several pools to choose from we mainly stayed by the 3 main pools, plenty of beds.    Beach was great being only 5 mins walk away. We were self catering but had breakfast once. €20 for breakfast is ridiculously expensive!! Had to queue 10mins to get a table. Hot food was awful and luke  warm, queues for tea and coffee. Had a good selection of cakes and pastries tho which my girls loved. I booked this hotel because I thought it would be  all singing all dancing for kids club and night time entertainment to keep the kids busy. My girls who normally would spend all day there don't even want to go. It's away from the pool so you can't keep an eye on them. No games etc by the pool for them. Bar by the pool was very limited for food. It was my 10 year olds birthday and we decided to have lunch in the buffet restaurant to celebrate. They kindly arranged a cake for me. Unfortunately lunch was awful. Didn't get our drinks for 20mins. Choice was very poor and again food was freezing. Soup was cold too! At €29 per head I expect so much more. I ended up eating a very small grilled fish,  a spoon of some hard rice that's it!! Dessert selection was better. My husband informed the waitress and the manager came and said because no one else complained so it couldn't be true!! Told him to go and check. He came back and didn't charge us for lunch. It was a total disappointment due to it being my girls bday. We ate out every  night so can't comment on the restaurant but we did go to the bar in the evenings to see what entertainment was on. First night 2 guys one singing and one on guitar  were brilliant. On other evenings we left after one drink as singers were depressing and failed miserably to entertain the guests. Service was awfully slow at the Terrance and bar. Word of advise take a cardi, jumper jacket.. it is freezing at night. 10/15 mins walk to new town, 10mins by car to old town. Both  old and  new town are both built up full of plastic covered menu restaurants it felt like I was in downtown Magaluf!! This is the first family holiday to Portugal and honestly don't think we will be back. So unimpressed with the whole resort, Restaurants and weather. For what we paid for definitely not value for money!"
Jul 2017,50,Grande Real,"Excellent location and amenities, well worth visiting. My family really enjoyed our stay and the staff were really helpful and kind. Nothing was too much trouble and the courtesy bus into Albufeira was a real bonus."
Jul 2017,50,Perfect location for a relaxing holiday,We had a wonderful time . Perfect hotel on the beach. The hotel is kept very clean and tidy even down to the beach which is swept daily .  The food is of a good quality and lots of choice. Staff mostly helpful with 1/2 exceptions.
Jul 2017,50,Excellent location - great resort!,"Resort was in a great location with easy access to a fantastic, picturesque beach.  The apartments were large and clean and the resort facilities were very good.   Highly recommended for families.  We would definitely return!"
Jul 2017,40,Review of hotel,"We travelled for a week from the 29/06/17 from Belfast, a family of 4, two girls, 10 and 7.We decided to organise our own transport from Faro and used the local taxi company - Yellowfish - booked online and they were great.We stayed half board.  You get vouchers from reception.  There are several places to eat on site but there's only one restaurant these vouchers can be used in which is frustrating.  The food was great though with a good selection from a buffet with vegetarian choices also. Desserts were gorgeous. Unfortunately my children are a bit picky but you can ask for a CHILDRENS MENU which has a better selection for the kids although if you order off this it takes a bit of time for them to bring it out.On the first day we had a bottle of water and two packets of smarties left in our room which was a nice touch by the staff. The room was cleaned every day and new toiletries left.Don't bring towels, the hotel provide towels every day.Unless we missed something, the entertainment at night was pretty poor.  When we were there it was the same two fellas singing on the terrace every night. Not much atmosphere and drinks were pricey. There is good mini supermarket in the complex next door if you come out of the hotel and turn right.  Don't do what I did for the first 4 days and turn left and walk 10 minutes to the Spar or big supermarket (I asked at reception on the first day and this is where they directed me)We stayed in room 571 which was just above a large pool and a small children's pool.  At the time we were there there were never any issues getting a sun bed and the place was quiet and relaxed although the pool bar was closed up for the week. We were happy to stay at this pool all week rather than walk over to the busier pool near the hotel. We had an issue with noisy neighbours in the appartment above, however, we phoned reception and this was dealt with straight away. The hotels wifi was excellent also."
Jul 2017,40,"Tepid food,poor entertainment","Most of the reviews I have read are from guests who stayed in the apartments.We stayed half board in the hotel.Room-We paid extra for a sea view room and we were allocated a room overlooking the tennis courts and the room was spacious and comfortable.FIVE STAR RATING and we had horrible plastic glasses in the room but it was noticeable that when the hotel laid on a special lunch for a convention the glasses they had outside looked crystal clear and looked like proper glass.Food-So many reviews have commented on the temperature of the food and the GM in some cases replies that he passes on comments to the departments so these departments are either not listening or he is not telling them.The fried eggs at breakfast were nearly always cold probably because they are on display too long and waiting in the wings you will find another batch already cooked waiting to replace an empty container.Evening meals-plenty of salad,main courses listed as HOT food on the menu was invariably tepid on top but warmer underneath.My wife did mention it to one of the restaurant managers and she stated the food should be hot.Plenty of desserts and cheese but with the desserts a lot of them contained sponge fingers to fill the small dish.WINE-You will find the wine is of course priced at 5star.A bottle of white wine 20euros,same wine local restaurant 14.95,local supermarket 6.29euros.Entertainment is poor which along with the prices of drinks in the bar results with no atmosphere.STAFF-very good and helpful,the hotel is very clean throughout,would I return-no and as we stated on the JET2 survey we rated this more of a four star.HANDCLEANSERS in the restaurant we did not see any and in this day and age cleanliness is important around restaurants especially when people dine outside where you frequently see birds around the tables and then people come inside helping themselves to food."
Jul 2017,50,Hotel,Just got back from a 10 day stay on self catering basis. Hotel is lovely and modern with comfy beds.Staff were all friendly and helpful with anything including trips and things to do.Although it was quite busy you could always get a sunbed in morning or afternoon so no mad rush so sunbeds in morning.It's about 15 mins walk to strip so not too far but far enough from noise on a nighttime.Walk out of hotel and turn left there a beach not too far away and you can also turn right there also another beach not too far I preferred the beach on the left beach it was a little quieter.Places to eat I recommend the cockerel it's English food and you may have to book because it's always busy.The clay oven if you want a good Indian really good food and nice decor always busy.We also went to Erin's isle Irish restaurant with home made Irish food and lovely Sunday lunch we had a lovely steak and a hearty Irish stew.It's a beautiful place and plenty to do so I would definitely recommend hotel.The only negative is not much entertainment in hotel.
Jul 2017,10,"Overpriced, dated and poor customer service","We just spent a week there as a family and while the hotel looks like it has nice facilities our apartments had significant plumbing issues and they charged 170 for a late check out with no servicing of the apartment, despite requesting 3 times. What really has disappointed me is that i raised it with them on the date before I left and was told that it was a bit late now (despite asking 3 times). I have emailed them since and got no joy. I won't be returning and won't be recommending. Just to note wifi is intermittent in their apartments."
Jul 2017,40,"Great Location ,variety  of activities .","Lovely resort ,great location suitable for families and adults .Lot of activities for both ,clean ,nice stuff and huge resort has a spot for everyone .But the buffet is not that great .A la carte restaurant are better ."
Jul 2017,50,Lovely hotel,"Hotel is lovely, staff very friendly. The only downside was the location of the hotel. It is a good 25 minutes walk to main resort. We thought entertainment at the hotel was very poor. They should try and vary the entertainment."
Jul 2017,50,Excellent place,"My partner and I we just loved it here :) definitely we will come back and stay here again!we just love it and feel so welcome.the stuff are so friendly and helpful, the food was very good..thank you again for make us feel welcome and really enjoying every min of it and definitely see you soon"
Jul 2017,50,Lovely resort for beach break!,"Spent a few days in a self-catering apartment and had a great stay.Pros- *Beach is gorgeous, fully life-guarded with amenities to rent/buy. It is a short walk from the resort.  *Multiple pool areas each with its own bar. *There is a shuttle to the town, but we didn't use it (had a car). *Our unit had a nice large terrace/deck which was a great surprise. *Self-catering amenities were good (except no sponge or soap for some reason - tons of dishes and pots/pans though). Very close to an intermarche.*Multiple restaurants with good service and food.*Plentiful included parkingCons- *Our A/C made the room smell kind of badly, but even in 85 degree weather it was pleasantly cool with windows all open."
Jul 2017,30,Underwhelmed,"Great location and nice property but so much room for improvement, particularly relating to customer service. Definitely doesn't come near 5 star in terms of service. Staff are indifferent, no tea or coffee brought to breakfast table in morning, you get you own and refills from one of 2 machines. They will not give you a second towel to lie out in despite the one they do give being too short. In a 5 star property, if you want a second towel that should be ok, right? Very poor selection of food at breakfast compared to other 4&5 star hotels we have stayed at in the region. Hot food on breakfast buffet was cold every morning and when I asked to get my porridge microwaved, I was told there was hot porridge on the breakfast bar. Had to check out early for an early flight, and the you my man behind reception never as much as asked how was our stay, goodbye or thank you!Won't be returning and couldn't recommmend it."
Jul 2017,50,The most breath-taking beachfront,"Santa Eulalia is a breathtaking beach that the resort was situated on. Great location - great view from my room. Breakfast was included and was always fresh, staff accommodating, rooms comfortable - the decor is a little dated and there should be water available in the rooms. The staff is friendly. It would be nice if you could charge the beach restaurants and beach chairs to your room so you don't have to worry about carrying cash around. All in all a great stay and will definitely stay here again. The location is walking distance to new town and 6euro taxi to Old Town Albuferia. There is a free hotel shuttle during certain hours. We loved our holiday here."
Jul 2017,50,Best Family Holiday,"It's with a heavy heart I write this review.On the one hand this place should be kept secret, on the other it's not fair if we don't share our experience. We stayed here for 10 nights in June. From our first experience of chatting to staff on the phone before we left ireland, until check out the experience was just amazing. The staff at reception were exactly what one wants but never quite gets, elsewhere. Friendly, helpful and professional are 3 words that come to mind yet don't give justice to what we experienced. The accommodation itself was super. I was a little nervous after reading mixed reviews but we could not fault our room. We had a lovely balcony with views of the sea and beach and it caught the evening sun. We always had a little tipple on the balcony while getting ready for our nights out. There was also a wonderful smell from the plants down below. We wish we could have brought that home with us! The decor is eclectic in the photos online but when you are here, you get it. The colours match the outdoor colour of the sea, coastline and caves and it all works. The breakfasts every morning were super, as long as you got down in time. We never waited long in queues but one morning we got in just for 10.30 and some of the hot food was finished. The fresh fruit and pastries were so good though it was easy to skip the hot food that one morning. We dined in the restaurant with the outdoor space over looking the sea on 4 or 5 nights. The food was lovely. A special shoutout to the two guys playing music. They were superb and made us feel so welcome. We hope they are back next season!!!we had a wonderful stay here. It was so clean, so friendly and so close to the beach. We would also like to give a big shout out to Phillipa who was working down at the pool bar. She was just lovely. Extremely professional and friendly, she gets a vote from us for employee of the season. She remembered our orders from day to day, always took care of us and was a great representation of your 5 star service. If you want a really stress free holiday in an amazing location book here.I hope there is availability for us next year!Things I didn't even mention:They book trips for youThere is a kiddies club where the staff really enjoy the kids.Zumba in the pool every evening. Amazing!!The quite place to sit over looking the sea. So tranquil.The gardensThe free bus to townCake and bubbly if it's your birthday........ I could go on and on. Our one and only problem was booking out. We need at least 14 nights next time. Keep up the good work Grande Real Santa Eulalia. We won't be going anywhere else anytime soon."
Jul 2017,50,Lovely holiday!,"We've just got back from a lovely week at the hotel.  We had a lovely room on the ground floor (as I don't like lifts) with a lovely seaview.  It was so nice to wake up to that view every morning.  Everything about the hotel is great, the food, service, staff, amenities, restaurants, pool, beach, etc., etc., and deserves it's 5* rating.  The buffet breakfast is amazing! The only problem we had was finding the hotel, as the Sat Nav could not find the hotel postcode, nor could it get us to Santa Eulalia. We spent ages driving around old town Albufeira, and had to stop and a ask a local lady, who managed to point us in the right direction.  A detailed map and maybe some directions in English (we could only print the route in Portuguese) would be so useful.   It was a long journey, and we were very tired, but when we found the hotel, we were so pleased and happy!  We'll definitely be back sometime! Thank you to all the staff at the GR Santa Eulalia Hotel for making our holiday brilliant.  Linda and George x"
Jul 2017,50,Great hotel & service,"Very beautiful and comfortable Hotel, with direct access to the beach and everything you wish for a perfect holiday. The food quality and variety is excellent, our room was a dream, the bed is not too soft."
Jul 2017,50,Brilliant Week,"Great week spent with family, could have stayed on for another week. Nothing was a hassle.. Will definitely be back again soon.. Maybe just have a disco/entertainment for kids in the evening would be great.. But no complaints!"
Jul 2017,50,Holidays,"High Standard - The only negatives were that the breakfast was expensive at €20 per Head and the shower fitting in the apartmenst were not of good quality. While the hotel is definitely a 5 Star, the apartments are more a 4 star. Finaly, it was a lovely gesture by the hotel to recognise my wifes 50th birthday with a bottle of champagne and birthday cake - a nice touch!!"
Jul 2017,50,Great family destination,"My husband, 2year old son and I had a great holiday here. It has a relaxed atmosphere with plenty for all the family. A park, kids club and lots of kids pools. It is located on the beach a short walk (10-15 mins) from the main strip.On our arrival there was smarties, cold milk and water in the apartment. Nightly entertainment in the bar overlooking the sea front.The staff couldn't do enough! A great family friendly hotel with the luxury of a five star resort."
Jul 2017,50,Family holiday,"Had an excellent stay at this hotel, was our second time there. The service was excellent, the staff can't do enough to help you. The breakfast selection is amazing, although they could look at how they arrange certain foods. I.e separate the pastries with nuts on! But other than that a lovely holiday!"
Jul 2017,50,Holiday,"Lovely stay in top hotel, kids enjoyed it. Very relaxing and high quality facilities in hotel. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Surroundings/resort were very attractive. Cleaning service also very good. Would go again."
Jul 2017,50,Wonderful Hotel,The studio we booked was upgraded free to an apartment which we were pleasantly surprised by. We had breakfast at the hotel which was very good and plenty to choose from. We eat out so can't really say how any of the restaurants was like. We spent almost all of our time on the Lovely beach! It was really good and we really enjoyed it.
Jul 2017,50,Excellent,"This hotel was absolutely fabulous, loved everything about it, visited with my husband and 13 yr old daughter, we had a self catering apartment overlooking the pool, clean towels, robes and toiletries every day including beach towels,perfectly located and beautiful restaurants, locals very friendly and would definitely recommend."
Jul 2017,50,Return visit.,"Our second family holiday to this great hotel & we were not disappointed. Super amenities, the apartments are ideal for families to choose whatever level of catering suits you. Brilliant Kids Club run by very enthusiastic & competent staff. In general the staff are wonderful, nothing is too much trouble. Great free shuttle bus into Albufeira. Excellent value for money can highly recommend. We cannot wait to return."
Jun 2017,50,Absolutely amazing ,"We stayed for a week here at the beginning of June and also got married at the grande real on the 7th. Well what can I say to sum up our stay other than how absolutely fantastic it was! The staff were a delight from reception, bar staff to the maids. Nothing was too much for anyone. We ate breakfast in the main restaurant and there was plenty of choice so that was perfect. We stayed in a sea view suite for 7 nights and it was so big it really made our stay comfortable! Also there were plenty of sun loungers around the pool every day so you could always find somewhere! On to the wedding day! We had 40 guests, all of which said it was one of the best wedding meals they'd ever eaten. The staff were fantastic from start to finish- ensuring our day went without a hitch. Angela and Patrica were a dream to deal with and were happy to accommodate everything to make sure we had the perfect day! Overall it's such a beautiful hotel- 5 minutes from albufeira strip, I wouldn't hesitate to go back here and hope I am able to soon!"
Jun 2017,50,Fantastic location,"This is a fabulous hotel with excellent facilities, our suite was great, the ambience throughout was good. The location could not be faulted with access to a beautiful sandy bay with a good range of amenities. The Bar Atlantic, overlooking the bay, was perfect for lunch, and night time cocktails. The main bar was good though the ""Happy Hour"" discount was not always applied. The Real Cozhina buffet was quite good but cooked food was often cool, especially at breakfast. The pools in the main part of the hotel complex were excellent and we always managed to get sun loungers. The 5 star rating is just about right, though small improvements such as a bottle of water per day would be well received. We liked the understated nature of the facilities and opportunities though they could be promoted in a more positive way. Perhaps the Half Board option could include a meal at the Pergula Restauran and the Sta Eulalia Restaurant!Overall, a fabulous hotel in a great location."
Jun 2017,40,Good Hotel,Good Hotel with high standards and very good value for moneyGreat Location with friendly staff.Very relaxing. I recommend it to my friends for a stay.Only 35 minutes coach drive from airportHotel maintains high standards
Jun 2017,40,Wonderful hotel set in a lovely bay,"Hotel was lovely,very clean, easy access to beach.Nice pools and plenty of sun beds available.Rooms spacious, we stayed in a resort view room which was quiet,it overlooked the car park so no sun on balcony. The sea view rooms or pool view rooms would be amazing. Rooms cleaned daily but only complimentary bottle of water on first day. Bottle of water at pool bar cost 4euro but at the Spar shop up the road in Santa Eulalia a really big container was only 69cents! Food & drinks rather pricey in the hotel but there's some restaurants within walking distance if you turn left out of the hotel and walk for about 12 minutes, otherwise you can get a taxi. Disappointed that the shuttle bus into the Old town didn't operate more often, the last bus into town was 18.20 and the last bus back to the hotel was just after 6pm, so you need to rely on taxis. Breakfasts were really good but noticed if you left it until 9ish there were queues building up to enter the dining room.Plenty of choice but they could do with another toaster machine as 1 isn't enough for the amount of people wanting to use it. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our holiday,the 2 main concerns were location and pricey drinks & food on site."
Jun 2017,50,10 days wanted to stay longer❤,"Had the best time in Portugal, glad i chose this hotel, we stayed in the apartments and could not say one bad thing about my stay here, staff are lovely and helpful. Loved the golf caddy ride to our room, all restaurants on the resort were fab but i fell in love with one just outside of the resort called Martins restaurante the food was amazing there!!! Deffo recommend going you won't be disappointed. I am on my final day here and i honestly do not want to leave, cleaners are also very friendly, entertainment in the bar area is great all singers are brill definitely coming back soon!! Thankyou for my time here and making my holiday amazing!!! Attached a few pics the food is from martins. To everyone who is about to experience grande real, i hope you enjoy every moment like i have 5**** xx"
Jun 2017,50,Excellent hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay. The accommodation, service and facilities are all excellent. We will definitely be back. Areas for improvement-a mini market stocking the basics would be very handy and save you having to trudge up the hill to the nearest shop. Also the kids club staff, although all very polite and pleasant, need to be more enthusiastic  and better trained in keeping the kids entertained. Our young children did not enjoy the kids club here and this was one of the main reasons for choosing the hotel"
Jun 2017,40,Wedding,"My sister got married here June 2017. Fab venue, beautiful views, lovely staff and the food was very nice. The rooms were perfect - 3 of us stayed in a suite and it was more than comfortable. Would recommend"
Jun 2017,50,weeks stay,"nicely kept hotel and apartments, our apartment was cleaned every-day and the surrounding grounds were very well maintained. Easy access to the beach with a great view. The restaurants all looked good, we had a meal overlooking the beach and the food was excellent. A great resort."
Jun 2017,50,Holiday,Lovely relaxing hotel. Perfect situation as we enjoy going on the beach. Low key entertainment at night could have been more varied. Service very good and plenty of choice to eat at breakfast and dinner. Enjoyed the quiet location.
Jun 2017,40,Disappointed,"We arrived at 12 our room wasn't ready so we're told to go and get a drink and food to come back at 2 we were shown to a studio right at the back of the resort facing a wall we instantly said no not staying in here we were taking back to reception to be spoken to like children to be sniggered at got what we paid for, we asked for a manager as we weren't happy with the way we were spoken to ,another young lad came out same response got what you paid for again asked for his manager as we couldn't believe for a five star hotel to be spoken to do badly to be laughed at, we then got a women who asked me to prove I had an email from your company to state we would have a pool view she didn't believe us she laughed I added for a refund and we would find our own accommodation she again laughed and said you wouldn't have received our money yet I said we booked in November again she dismissed my response and went back to you got what you paid for? We again asked for a manager by this time I was extremely dissaponited thoroughly embarrassed and couldn't believe the service and response from managers, we then were seen by a male manager whose attitude was what you would expect I understand about the rooms and check in times but you are aware well in advance of arrival times we also watched many guests arrive at the same time and after us get there rooms, we were shown a room again at the back of the resort but with a pool view, we accepted this but decided we were not going to use any of the facilities in the hotel it has thoroughly ruined what was supposed to be a luxury break for us I cannot stress the hurt and stress this visit caused"
Jun 2017,50,Mcaleese,Good service very clean and good location not near a cash machine the pool side service was slow but we had a very nice stay in a very clean and well run hotel the beach was a real treat to have at the hotel and this would bring us back the food at the pool side was limited you could not get toasties but there was a great selection of restaurants to choose from
Jun 2017,30,Mother & Daughter Break,"This was my fourth visit to this hotel but my daughter's first and this was our first mother daughter break together. I chose this hotel again because me & my husband have enjoyed previous stays here. I have to admit this time I was disappointed.  We decided to stay on a half board basis but was very disappointed with the food, the various dishes were lukewarm at best. On our first night the restaurant manager asked us if we enjoyed our meal & I explained about the food being barely warm to which he apologised & said he would speak to the chef but the next night it was exactly the same. Also my daughter is not a meat eater & found the food very limiting. I can't fault the breakfast as although it's much the same every morning it was still very good with lots of choice.The hotel itself is lovely with beautiful views &the staff are very friendly & helpful. The rooms are really in need of some tlc and along with the evening meals let's the hotel down in general and prevents me giving it a 5* rating. It's very popular for weddings & we saw some beautiful weddings during our stay. It's also popular with families There are some really good restaurants on the sea front"
Jun 2017,50,sun relax holiday,"Everything about the hotel was great. The pool areas and beach were lovely. I enjoyed the breakfasts, which had a large amount of choice and was all fresh and tasty. I didn't use any of the restaurants but the pool snack bar was very good. Rooms were very clean and well looked after. Easy access to the beach. I went to the strip most evenings for food..and there is plenty of choice. It is a bit of a walk but I enjoyed it...and there are places nearer. Overall I had a lovely relaxing, high quality sun holiday. Couldn't think of any faults, and would certainly go again."
Jun 2017,40,Great Time,We came for a wedding of a friend and it was a wonderful setting.  Our stay was great but would not say it was a 5 star resort.  Food was very good but a bit over priced.  Service in the bar was not the quickest.  I would say all the staff were very friendly.  Overall I would recommend this hotel and I would go back.
Jun 2017,50,Wonderful holiday,"We loved everything about this resort. We have always stayed closer to centre in previous years and at first thought being further away from amenities would be a problem, but we were completely wrong.  Being further away made our holiday better....we were able to relax completely, whilst still having all we needed on hand.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which was very spacious and well-equipped. The pool was nearby, but we preferred to go to the beach most days which was a few minutes walk away.  We appreciated having towels supplied daily for beach/pool use. We found all young serving/reception staff at the resort to be extremely friendly and helpful.We will most definitely be returning to this resort for our next holiday! 😁"
Jun 2017,50,susan,had a amazing time and would consider coming back be really good if there was more entertainment for kids at the pool and at night and some music around the pool in the day time other than that everything was really good 👌
Jun 2017,30,Family holiday,Not 5-star so was dissapointed. Beds horribel and rooms outdated. The hotel kind of grew upon us during the stay. The area around the hotel is dull. A lot of trafic and no good restaurants. You need a car to enjoy the area. After we rented a car our experience became better. All in all we had a nice vacation but would not go back.
Jun 2017,50,Birthday treat,"We didn't know anything about this place except through other peoples reviews, and even then we were sceptical about it, surely it can't be that good....We were the only two people getting off the transfer coach, even other passengers were googly eyed as well as us, Bellhops came and took our luggage into a vast reception area, check in was so simple and 10 minutes later we were shown to our room... It was spacious, airy, clean and a big balcony overlooking the beach.....I could go on but I don't want to bore you....lets just say it was a fantastic stay"
Jun 2017,50,My stay,We have been to the resort before and loved it so much we are hoping to return each year..my only complaint would be that there are no sachets of coffee or tea in the room..really missed that in the morning while getting ready for the day and would expect it for a 5* resort..apart from this our holiday was perfect thankyou xx
Jun 2017,40,Sun holiday ,My husband and I really loved our 2 week stay in the Grand Real St Eulailia in Albufaria. We stayed in a studio apartment and it was excellent. Cleaning staff just brilliant. Towels and bed linen changed so frequently. Reception always helpful. Location fabulous and very safe. We will be returning.
Jun 2017,50,Short stay,"Lovely resort , all the facilities we needed for our short stay. Studio was excellent and very comfortable. Food was excellent may be a bit expensive recommend going all inclusive . Coffee not good ! Beach was lovely and so close . Resort was very clean . Staff very good .  Albufeira was not the nicest of places ."
Jun 2017,50,Excellent hotel!!,"We have just returned from a lovely holiday in Albuferia at this hotel. The hotel is maintained to a very high standard. Everywhere was spotlessly clean. We had a suite with a pool view which was very spacious and clean with everything you need for a self catering holiday. The hotel is situated within easy walking distance to a beautiful beach and many restaurants and bars.The balcony was a little small, there were 3 of us sharing the suite and while it was extremely spacious inside, it was difficult to get 3 chairs on the balcony."
Jun 2017,50,Lovely resort,"Very pleased with our stay, lovely hotel, perfect location, very clean, quiet location, polite friendly and helpful staff. Would highly recommend and not hesitate to stay again. Overall an excellent holiday."
Jun 2017,40,Our week long stay in Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Spa,"Lovely hotel, great food, good service. Two negative comments - hotel too far away from any village or town - we normally like to dander into the local village or town each evening but couldn't do this.  We booked a room in the hotel overlooking the resort. Instead we were told we were ""upgraded"" and were stuck in the furthest apartment from the main reception looking into another apartment - very disappointing. On a positive note...very close to beach which was wonderful ."
Jun 2017,50,Fabulous wedding.,"Fabulous location for a wedding, rooms very clean with comfortable beds and nice clean white fluffy towels in bathrooms.  Staff at wedding really nice, food was excellent as was service.  Our room Overlooked the sea and two swimming pools, so at dawn the puppy look was lovely.  Would recommend this hotel ideal for families as well as couples. Would love to come again."
Jun 2017,50,Highly Recommend,"Stayed in Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa on a recent week's break. Excellent well maintained property. Staff excellent, very efficient and friendly. Late arriving however Ruben, Stephen on reception very welcoming.  Apartments very spacious and clean. Serviced daily. Housekeeping team very prompt and courteous. Many fine bars & restaurants on site. Beach front right on your door step. Perfect location with old town and new town a short walking distance. Hotel provides regular shuttle daily to both towns. Taxi approx €5.00 each way. Highly recommend to anyone considering this resort, will definitely return in the future."
Jun 2017,40,50th Celebration Holiday,"We traveled mid June 2018 to celebrate a friends 50th Birthday.  The hotel staff were excellent, polite and courteous.  The room was clean and had everything we needed, though us Brits would like tea/coffee making facilities in our room which we did miss.  Also our air conditioning was faulty, but was fixed very quickly when we reported it, though I am not sure the thermostat was set correctly as I didn't feel cool, even when set at 17 degrees.  We had a fabulous time with our friends and really enjoyed lazing by the pool or on the beach.  We had a great time away and would recommend this hotel, even with the couple of niggles, everything else was great."
Jun 2017,50,lovley place,Really lovley place and people overal was a lovley break and wedding was beautiful hotel was clean and very well maintain with lots of facility's would stay there again and for a longer period of time next time
Jun 2017,40,Huge hotel beach front,Excellent view of the Algarve sea. You can stay at the hotel or rent a villa. There are swimming pools everywhere. It has a spa and a small gym. The service is ok but it's a little messy. Breakfast is ok but misses local fresh products. It's important to have a car to move around the area.
Jun 2017,40,Nice hotel. Food quite expensive so never ate there,"Nice hotel. Near a lovely beach. Taxi ride to Old Town Albufeira (costs about 7 euros each way). Attended a wedding here which was superb. Food and waiter service was first class at wedding. Location for a wedding superb. Rest of time we ate out because it was 32 euros for buffet evening meal and there were seven of us in our group. If it had been say 20 euros we would have used the restaurant every night. Entertainment not good in Hotel so not much to keep you in the Hotel on an evening. So we ventured into the Old Town which was bustling with stag and hen parties. Got a real buzz about the place. Hotel grounds and Reception area very nice. Had a lovely holiday. Would we go back to the Hotel ? Nothing to say bad about the place, I just prefer to stay closer to restaurants / supermarkets etc... unless the Hotel has good entertainment and reasonable food prices which this one doesn't have. So would probable stay in the Old Town although restaurants/bars are not cheap there either."
Jun 2017,20,Pool,The hotel is great only down fall is that the pools are no good if you have a dissability they are like holes in the ground if you have one leg or none you wont be able to use any of the pools as there is nothin to hold on to goin in or out the pools
Jun 2017,40,Return trip,Staff are very helpful appartments have all you would want but could do with a refurb esp the sitting area and the outside patio needs new chairs and tables  food is not as good in main restraunt as a five star should be overall we enjoyed our stay and will be back
Jun 2017,50,"Family of four, kids 3 and 5 years old.","We love this hotel. We feel safe and looked after all the time here. Love their weekly programs that are mostly free for guests. The spa charges for the pool area, which is a bit odd in this day and age. The appartments are cleaned daily and are a little tired in the decor. The bed mattresses need a make over. Its right on a beautiful beach and the free shuttle bus daily from the hotel to Albufeira is great. Arrive early, there may be queues.  The kids club is good and ran well. More suited to the younger kids."
Jun 2017,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Hotel and Spa Resort,"Been coming here for the past 4 years now and will continue to visit this lovely hotel.Top marks for this hotel!Breakfast is amazing, all food is delicious and the service is outstanding.I would recommend this hotel to anybody who wants a top quality holiday in the Algarve.Kids club is amazing and keeps kids happy all day.Hotel is right on the beach and also away from noise.10 out of 10!"
Jun 2017,50,"Time out in Portugal in Grande Real, Santa Eulalia","Excellent hotel/apartment complexes in very quiet beachfront setting.Wonderful for families with small kids,grandparents and single travellers too.Fantastic food buffets with wide range of foods and beautiful fresh fruits.Great place for a complete chill out,with a family or group or on your own.Highly recommend."
Jun 2017,50,Excellent stay,"Perfect hotel to stay for holiday. Spotlessly clean and all the ammenities you would ask for. Pools are in a great location beside apartments, wifi is good throughout. Great air conditioning in rooms. Staff are very friendly.Looking forward to our next visit!"
Jun 2017,50,Holiday,"Excellent hotel and facilities. We stayed in the self catering apartments which were clean, well maintained and comfortable. Maid service everyday. A bottle of champagne and a cake with the compliments of the hotel to celebrate a family birthday were much appreciated."
Jun 2017,50,1 week break with kids,"The hotel is clean fresh and friendly! couldn't fault anything except the baloney areas are a little small but didn't really bother us. The rooms are very nice! and up to date! The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly and the bar staff enjoyed a good chat. The swimming pool is great and the kids enjoyed the fun there with all the inflatables the hotel has provided. Overall what a lovely stay! location is perfect! nice 10 mins walk to the beach, and all the local bars shops etc everyone really friendly! I will return!"
Jun 2017,50,Perfect ,We stayed here for a week and really could of done with 10 days it's so relaxing . Apartments are well equipped absolutely spotless house keepers do a really good job cleaned every day & fresh towels everyday . Beds are a bit uncomfortable. We had dinner here twice the buggers are so good it's a must and strawberry daiquiris are the best iv ever had (iv tried a lot ) staff were very friendly would definitely recommend this hotel can't wait to visit again
Jun 2017,50,Wonderful Week,"One of my favourite hotels in Europe, wonderful staff, they could not be more helpful! Great location (on the beach) and the hotel itself is of the highest standard, its our second time staying here and there will be a 3rd soon!"
Jun 2017,50,Great spot for quiet and relaxing holiday,"Travelled with our toddler (18months) in early May. Booked a 1 bed apartment, with travel cot included. Apartment was perfect for our needs, kitchen /living area with separate bedroom and bathroom, and a small balcony area with seating. Everything was clean and well maintained. We went to local supermarket and ate breakfast and lunch in the apartment every day, then went out for dinner as it suited best for toddler. The complex itself was perfect for our needs, kids pool was just across from our apartment and it was relatively quiet (no school holidays!) the toddler loved it and never wanted to leave. The private access beach was also so close and kept beautifully - sun beds and umbrellas available for a small fee.We used the kids club on one rainy afternoon and although under 3's cannot be left there unsupervised (no problem for us), the place was well stocked with toys and books for the smallies and he was encouraged to join in and play. He had a ball here!Can't comment on food or bar but overall the hotel looked very clean and well maintained and I'd be happy to return again. Only negative for me was the beds/mattress - both me and my husband found this very uncomfortable and we are not fussy or bad sleepers. Both complained of sore backs by the time we were leaving!"
Jun 2017,50,A wonderful 10 days,"Without doubt a perfect holiday.I brought my family,wife ,son,daughter in law and 2 grandchildren.On arrival it had the WOW factor.Everything about your hotel was great,the staff were so pleasant throughout the hotel,apartments were very roomy spotless at all times.Everyone in my family really enjoyed the whole experience.Food,pool and beach and the staff made it wonderful.We shall return as a couple/family again.I cannot recommend it highly enough please thank all your staff.Brian Page and family"
Jun 2017,50,Fabulous Hotel,"Such a lovely hotel, best reception and front of house staff, lovely room, extremely comfortable bed, great wifi, breakfast was very good(could do with more adult cereals)evening buffet had excellent choice. Pool was lovely and clean. (Pool bar staff could be more professional)"
Jun 2017,30,"Amazing, Until hotel club bouncer ruined our last night!","Had a great time celebrating my friends 50th birthday with him at this hotel with no troubles, the staff were friendly, the hotel was stunning! And with the strip only 5 minute cab away it was perfectly placed next to the beach! With the best fish restaurant I've personally ever been to!!over looking the beach. Unfortunately on our last night which was a Saturday we didn't want to go to far as we had an early flight, with this in mind we went down to the hotels club disco (only on Saturdays) which is just a two minute walk from the reception. When we arrived we were met by two hostile bouncers, they kept staring at us from the get go making us very uncomfortable so we left after 2mins of being there as we were looking for a fun filled evening not a a fist fight!! Upon leaving the bouncers stood in the door and told us to calm down when we were trying to leave. Very confused at this they finally stepped out of the way whilst staring us down they laughed in our faces. It was like they wanted trouble with us. The situation completely embarrassed the hotel in my eyes after such a good weekend."
Jun 2017,50,Amazing holiday!,"Just got back from a week at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia, honestly wish it had been longer! Stayed with my husband and our three year old son in a one bedroom apartment and it was well equipped with everything we needed. Extremely clean apartments and spacious. Could possibly have done with more fridge room but that was minor. The resort is in a great location, room card allows access to the gate to get to Santa Eulalia beach and the hotel provides a free shuttle service regularly to the new and old towns, though it can get full up and I imagine even more so in high season. We used the intermarche supermarket the most, which is about a 10-15 min walk towards the old town, though the pingo doce not far from where the shuttle lets you off for new town was much bigger and had a butchers inside. The pools near our apartment block were ideal, not very busy though a little cold for our sons liking. He very much enjoyed the main hotel pool which was heated though! The kids club is good, always have activities going on and the staff are good at interacting with kids; there is the option to leave children there but I cannot comment as I stayed whilst my son was there. Went to the spa for a massage and it was incredible, definitely a 5* spa experience! All in all, we had an amazing holiday and were genuinely sad when we had to leave, the only negative I can think to say of the whole time was that the beds were awfully uncomfortable! But other than that, perfect :)"
Jun 2017,40,Good family resort,"This is a resort in itself with hotel rooms and private apartments with 3 swimming pools, many restaurants and bars.The resort has direct access to Santa eulalia beach and is mostly used by the resort people. It is a bit away from the city centre but they have drop facilities but limited time. I got a great deal at make my trip and all over it was a relaxing trip"
Jun 2017,40,Lovely place,We have just got back from a 5day trip there and what a lovely place very clean and modern with an indoor pool and spa plus an outdoor pool with lots of outdoor  space staff very friendly and hotel not far from the main strip plus there's loads of other little bars if u want something more quite this is are second time to albufeira and this hotel roped the last one we will definitely be coming back!
Jun 2017,50,Lovely... again!,"We stayed here for the second time - as the first time was so memorable and such a great location. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. The lobby is vast but somehow still 'cosy' with lots of spots to sit and relax. The outdoor pools are freezing but the spa is amazing (extra cost) but quiet and worth it!! Great beach location too - very picturesque. Breakfast is fantastic - huge buffet with so much choice and champagne every morning! Range of restaurants mean you don't have to leave the resort if you don't want to - food at all of them is lovely, favourite is the fish restaurant on the ocean front. All staff very friendly and helpful. Another wonderful stay here - thank you :)"
Jun 2017,50,Great holiday especially for the children,We booked this resort on the recommendation of a friend and were not disappointed . The accommodation ( we had an apartment ) was first class. Kept clean and very comfortable .  Others had complained that they overlooked the car park but it's not that bad.  Staff are friendly and helpful especially the waiters and kids club team .
Jun 2017,50,Another lovely holiday,"We stayed here in  May and  once again we had a lovely holiday. We have been 3 times before. The staff in general are always polite and helpful. The rooms are spotlessly clean and we would always recommend a sea view. We prefer to stay here as it is a little out of the way but there is a courtesy bus supplied by the hotel which takes you into albefueuira. Unfortunately, as on previous visits you are not always guaranteed to get the bus, it is only small and people are often turned away. Luckily you can get a taxi for about 7 euros one way. On the down side if you can really call it one, this year people from another hotel were allowed to use the facilities which meant that clients at the hotel couldn't get on the bus, there was also a music festival held right beside the main pool area where people were dancing salsa, some quite intimately in their bikinis, not what we really wanted to see and we did address this with reception who apologised. the breakfast is adequate but food on the hot plate is never, ever hot, only slightly warm and I do think this lets the hotel down considering its 5 star rating, there is cold food, hams cheeses, fruit etc but no smoked salmon, salad or cucumber,  just tomatoes. Staff in the dining room are lovely, nothing is too much trouble but when we return next year I would like a hot breakfast! Obviously these are only trivial things but corrected I feel that it would make a difference. As far as conferences go, a hotel should not be allowed to close off the pool area to accommodate corporate events in holiday times, this isn't fair to customers who are looking forward to a lovely holiday which they have saved hard for,  and using the pool area is very important when you are on holiday This did annoy some guests, and rightly so. There are ample sunbeds at all times and the hotel does not get overrun which is nice. We did have a super holiday as always and we will go back again next year."
Jun 2017,50,Excellent hotel,Nice rooms with view on the beach. Carpets in the room not very healthy for people with allergy to dust. Very good breakfast with a large variety of food. Waiters are very kind. Buffet lunch is very nice: a large variety of food for every kind of needs. Well equipped gym. A lot of swimming pools unfortunately not used for lack of time.In general very positive experience.
Jun 2017,50,Another great stay,"This is our third stay and the upgrades to the hotel are obvious.  We didn't think it was that bad before but it definitely looks fresher and the new kitchens look great.  Only let down was the bathroom which need a deep clean as some of the grouting was black, but for a shower was fine. The staff are very friendly and accommodating (Antonio and Christina are both great) but as are the rest of the team.    The location on the hotel is great and although not far from the strip is lovely and quiet.     The bar was reasonably priced but we didn't use the restaurant bit the menu which had a set price of 15€ looked ok.    There were people reserving sun beds in the morning but this wasn't necessary as there were plenty."
Jun 2017,50,Excellent!! Beautiful hotel in a stunning location,"We had a pleasant check-in , quick and the concierge helped to get our bags out from coach and up to rooms.The weather was lovely for end of may. The hotel is beautiful and in an excellent location, on the coast so giving to you private access to beach however you do have to pay for parasols & Sun loungers. The private access to beach has about 4 set of 10 steps so for those with mobility/pushchairs before the s scan the room card at door if you continue down the hill on the right you come to a large gate which you can open by pressing the telecom button and someone with let you out once you've confirmed your room number. We had a lovely suite which was located in the main building with a large bedroom with queen size bed plus extra space on side for a cot, a  living room with a double size sofa bed, 2 bathrooms and two balconies. At our request a kettle and a cot was provided and ready for us to use when we arrived with complimentary chocolates and a bottle of water. We also had a studio room which was located just outside the main building which was fully equipped with a kitchen, on the downside side as far as I could see there wasn't any lift access to the upper rooms so you can pick a pushchair up but am not sure how anyone with wheelchair would get up. We had 2 tv's in our room how I think only 1 channel out of 33 channels was in English so abit of a down fall on that. On the plus side the hotels free Wifi was the best I have seen in any hotel and kids were able to stream and watch videos on their iPads.The food was brilliant, with more on quality then quantity, Michelin style- large selection of food for breakfast, although omelettes wasn't on the menu the chef was more than happy to make you one if you asked. The food selection was quite limited however with us nearly all lunchtime the restaurant was in use for wedding banquet so we were told to dine in the beach front Atlantico restaurant where you can pick anything of the menu to order... excellent choice of fast food. The hotel has 7 pools within its complex of which 3 are part of the main building- and plenty of sun loungers.. your given a towel rental card on arrival and you hand this at the desk to get swim towels which you then have to return back in order to get the cards back or else there's €15 charge for each towel not returned. A shuttle service runs few times a day to take guests to old town & new town, there is a maximum seat capacity of 27 so you have to line up 10mins early to ensure you get a seat. The taxi fares are ok, we paid €19 for zoo marine & €7 to the algarve shopping mall one way. We were very pleased with the hospitality of staff definitely a 5* and it was a nice surprise for my husband to be presented with a cake and bottle of bubbly in room on his birthday. The staff always when that extra mile and nothing was too much to ask always very helpful and polite. All in all and excellent hotel and a pleasant stay, I was definitely recommend this accommodation. :)"
Jun 2017,50,P E R F E C T,everyone is to kind. Joana and steven are the best.We had a good good stay and we will come back in August to have the same vacay but in Lissabon. But for Joana and Steven we will come to Albufeira to visit them. The Appartment was very clean and the service was more then 5 stars :)
Jun 2017,50,Relaxing stay,Hotel was lovely. Very clean and very welcoming. Pool area was nice and relaxing. Rooms were cleaned every day. Hotel is a little away from the nightlife which means that it is quiet at night. Make sure to leave sufficient time to get to the airport. It is a good 30 minute journey but we traveled at around peak time and it took longer.
Jun 2017,50,Lovely Resort,"I attended an event at the resort which was very professionally handled by the Resort staff and event organizers.  Lovely room, lovely resort and easy walk to a very nice beach.  For a 5* resort I would have expected bottled water to be provided every day in the room and not just on day 1 and I did miss not having a coffee machine in the room.  However I didn't ask.My main comment would be not to come during ""school holidays"" as the resort was very popular with large/extended  family groups.  I stayed in the main hotel and found that there were no quiet sunbeds and the pools were crowded with children and large inflatables. I would return to the Resort but not during the school holiday period."
Jun 2017,20,Disappointing and not a 5-stae resort,"Having arrived yesterday, and with a plan to stay for 10 more nights we are left with a disappointing start to our long awaited holiday with our 4year old son and 6mo old daughter. To be a 5-star, here is a minimum of what to expect: Welcome drinks at check-in, a decent duvet and cover (not a simple and dirty blanket with the weight of a cruiseship), a bathroom fan that doesn't sound like a spaceshuttle, fresh on-demand eggs/omelett breakfast (here you have to pick one of the cold ones in the queued up serving area). It's also normal that the bar at the pool is open. It's now 10:45, and still not possible to get a single bottle of water..(!!) No waiters to see in any direction. The pool has not been cleaned, the childrens pool has sand in it. Maybe it's a 5-star sand, I don't know. Weather is nice, though. Which is nice when you are queued up for the shuttle-bus to Albufeira with not nearly enough capacity. 3 stars Santa, not 5. Looking forward(?) to the next 10 days here..."
Jun 2017,50,Excellent Location for Business and Pleasure,"We stayed from June 1st till 6th due to the organisation of our dancing event. It was the 2nd edition and it went better than last year.The rooms are extremely well maintained, extremely well cleaned. The staff that cleans them are super nice, some of them a little bit more quiet but there is a lady with blond short hair cleaning the area of the 200s that is really sympathic.Reception:If not mistaken with the name Miss Eugenia is simply amazing on her perceptivity sympathy, advices, proactivity, finding solutions etc. All those I talked to are super nice but indeed she stands out.Main restaurant: Maybe as I changed my eating habits to more healthy ones I felt it lost a bit the quality I remember from last year... but nothing special, food is very delicious, probably I just felt less options for it... nevertheless as mentioned all I ate was very good (specially the 2 days I decided to go for a bit of dessert OMG)Pool area: is simply amazing, the staff at the pool bar are TOP, specially the boy that is responsible for it!Spaces and alternatives to make an event is something that they have plenty. Huge congress center with awesome wood floor (not common, I hate carpets)LE Club and Sea's Lounge are simply the Gem of this location!Restaurant Sant Eulalia offers surprising conditions to make something there.The mezzanine on top of the reception we never used it but my colleagues did and I know it's incredible place as well.The Groups/congress staff: Ana Viegas, Lina Silva and Joana Chaves, this is a success Triangle.For Any of them I have no words to describe their amazing personality but above all their professionalism. We worked as well with Inês who is the sweetest lady ever! Nevertheless this year we had the LUCK, yes pure LUCK, joy, pleasure, etc etc etc of having Lina and Joana taking care of our event and nothing was missed out. Ana is one of the best professionals I've worked with in all my experience organizing events, when it comes to find/offer solutions, trying to meet either both hotel and client needs without compromising any of the sides.Lina and Joana are yin and yang who complement each other in a way you can't imagine. You get this triangle and your event is set for success.Our clients are extremely happy with the location and several already asked for the 3rd edition. We hope to gather all we need to make it happen as well.From my wife Giedre, my partners Robert and Jean white and myself our biggest thank you for everything you did for us and our group."
Jun 2017,40,Nice setting,"Had a nice short break in albufeira. This hotel is listed as a 5 star but i think that is due to facilities on offer, it is by no means a luxury hotel. Location was good : a nice setting up overlooking the beach. New town and praia de oura are walking distance. Old town needs a bus or taxi or uber but honestly I wouldn't bother... Room was clean except i am dubious about the bathrobes just folded up and not washed because i found a long hair in it that was in no way mine... The grounds are lovely and spacious but not much going on as off season. Found all the staff to be courteous and professional. Breakfast was okay but lacking any panache, again not luxury, but adequate and good coffee!!!"
Jun 2017,50,No words,"We went to a wedding to this hotel,My god they pulled all the stops it was one of the best beautiful weddongs i have ever been to, you know they went out of the way when 2 couples booked there wedding at this venue the next day."
Jun 2017,50,Family Stay,Had a fantastic trip. Accommodation was beautiful and so comfortable. The balcony's should be blocked from each apartment as with 2 toddlers we couldn't sit out as they were out on other balcony's. Had an encounter with a bar man on one of the days he was very rude and did not want to assist me when I ordered a sandwich to bring to the pool for my 2 year old. He was extremely rude and difficult to deal with but all other staff very very pleasant. Will be back and highly recommend your hotel to everyone.
Jun 2017,30,"Huge resort (too big), fantastic beach udner the hotel","Rooms bit outdated but still ok; spa area is a jke: sauna was broken, steam bath was turned on on request only :-( the prices for the minimalistic spa were ridiculous...staff seemed overloaded with the amount of guests, food could use bit more diversity, even as buffet! Its more like 2,5 stars for me..."
Jun 2017,30,Not a 5 star hotel,"We stayed at this hotel from the 2 June 2017 till 5 June 2017 and must say there are some good and not so good bits.  Having stayed in 5* accommodation across the world, I would not class this as a 5* Hotel.  The rooms looks tired, carpets is worn down, WiFi is almost non existent in the room, there are NO GLASSES or coffee making facilities in the room.  Not even complimentary water is provided - all basic things expected from a 5* hotel. All the staff we encountered throughout our stay was friendly and made you feel welcome.  The hotel is in a lovely location with direct access to the beach.  If you are looking for the 5* experience, then this wouldn't be the hotel to go for. If you are looking for location with beautiful views - then this hotel would be a great choice."
Jun 2017,40,Nice 5 star hotel with friendly personnel,"Very nice place to stay, particularly with children. The hotel is clean and has lots of swimming pools. However, only one is heated. Of course that one is crouded. But it was still nice. A little complain about all the people that came to the pool with misbehaving children and babies. It happened one day that someone even pooped in the main pool, the only warm one. The whole day was distroyed for most of us. Nobody could go into there for that day. One day of holiday missed. The hotel should take care that people using the pools are more carefull. Otherwise, nice place. The beach is just behind the hotel. Apart from the restaurant near the beach, the restaurants are very expensive."
Jun 2017,40,Would be exellent if spa was included in a price of booking!,"In general we had a good stay, although it was little short. Rooms are spacious and clean, good for couples and retired people as its on the quiet side. Not much to do for children, apart from a Kids club one hour per day. You need to bear in mind that use of spa is not including in the price of booking, you need to pay extra for it as well as for a massage, €60 per sessions. Something, one not being made aware of from the start. good location as to closeness to the beach, about 10 min slow walk. Overall, my little boy enjoyed it and we made most of what it had to offer."
Jun 2017,20,The third time is not the charm,It was my 3th time here due to my job. This time I stayed in the main building. Still the same dated room with a very very dubious decoration. Hard mattress and cheap sheets. Very good bathroom amenities. I have no clue why the room has an empty mini bar! That's odd.  Outside and in common areas the hotel is really beautiful and very well maintained. Some renovations in the rooms should be a project for tomorrow!
Jun 2017,30,"Disappointing, but a nice potential, a very good location","Room :The room is clean, but of a standard boring decoration. Old curtain, old carpet. A small frigidaire not so new. No espresso machine, no kettle for tea. No bed USB plugs, no possibility to load your devices when you are out of the room, no electrical plug in the safe box. The bathroom is a closed one, no window, and it is clearly outdated. An oval sink from the 80's. No music dock station, simply an old flat TV simply put on the table, few TV channels, worst many are not properly tuned, annoying, some black channels. No DVD player nor a library of films. A weak wifi signal. In few words, not a 5* room, but an average 3* room, at most.In addition, we had no view in our room, only the parking view :( It means, hearing the shuttle bus and people queuing for it, the cars... it means you have always to get the curtains closed... no intimacy, nor full fresh air. However the hotel itself has a nice location. In front of a sand Atlantic beach. The garden gives some green background around, a good Point. A very nice landscape and site.There are small round swimming pools, one for kids, one for adults. It is a sea salted one. Good point, but you can not swim really. The sizes of those pools are clearly not adapted to the capacity of the hotel.The buffet breakfast is really poor, standard, not well presented (with undersigned plates of different models...). Buffet with mainly basic international junk food. No Portuguese, nor fresh specialities. Basic coffee, difficult to get, you have to queue. No espresso machine. No fresh eggs on demand, nor fresh on demand omelettes, for a 5* hôtel... basic industrial breads. You have to ""fight"" or be patient to get a cup of coffee. Only two coffee machines. No fresh viennoiseries, just industrialized ones.Breakfast to be avoided. Or just enough for a 2 or 3* hotel. The breakfast room itself is extremely noisy, chaotic, not pleasant. The buffet is not well designed for a large capacity. Some additional ""buffet"" islands are only made of tables...We did not like also the buffet dinner, again standard common basic food. The white wine was a killing cheap one as alcohol is concerned. Good point : There is a spa, with a spa pool. But even as a customer, you can not use it freely, but only at a cost of 18euros (sic). There is a fitness area... a good size with many equipments. And a nice yoga room (however only few courses scarcely given in the week)."
Jun 2017,50,Fantastic hotel,"We have just returned after a week stay at this resort hotel and it was lovely! Hotel rooms were spacious and well decorated very clean and daily maid service with loads of clean towels, hotel facilities were great and due to having at least 4 pools with sun beds and umbrellas there was space available at anytime no queuing for beds first thing on a morning, which added to the relaxing atmosphere that the hotel has created. Staff couldn't of done enough to make our stay any more enjoyable🤗The only down side was that it was a good 20 minute walk into the centre ok for us as we don't mind the walk but could limit older guests.Will definitely recommend this and would return again for another holiday."
Jun 2017,40,Not perfect but would come again,"We stayed in the apartments, which were lovely but had a couple of flaws: The wardrobes, drawers and cupboards smelt very strongly of damp. The wooden pillars outside were rotten and bits were falling off. The fridge had a smell we couldn't get rid of. Negatives aside, the staff were lovely, the apartment was close to the pools yet still very quiet. The hotel was beautiful. We were self catering so can't comment on the restaurants but we would come back again."
Jun 2017,40,Beautiful location,Fab beach plenty of sun beds around pool. Wi fi poor . Food and beverages very expensive. Would have liked places to walk too the Old Town was quite chaotic lots of hen/stag parties. Couldn't fault staff informative and helpful.
Jun 2017,50,Simply beautiful!,"We have stayed here 4 times in total, and each time have had a wonderful holiday, stunning views, accommodation is spacious and clean, kids club fantastic, great location, drinks and snacks a bit expensive and evening entertainment could be better, but overall wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel!"
Jun 2017,50,Another great trip,"This was our 3rd visit & already I am planning our return! The kids club & photographer are excellent.We were looking for a quiet, relaxing holiday with young children and this fitted the bill perfectly."
Jun 2017,40,Very pretty on the outside,"For a 5* resort I was hoping for more.  The venue was stunning on the outside, lovely pool area, nice grounds.  Inside the interiors are tired and dated.  The bedroom on the second floor I stayed in were very tired, carpet worn, decor outdated, small tv and outdoor furniture was in need of replacing.  The aircon was dodgy but it was serviced on our request and attended to quickly.  There was a smell from the drains in the bedroom that smelled of poo at times.  On the upside the bed was very comfortable, the staff were so lovely.  We attended a wedding there and it was a lovely experience and the hotel did an amazing job.  Lovely location right on the beach with a range of restaurants and lovely service by the pool."
Jun 2017,50,good looking place,went  there to pick up people on our way to the air port if you want something out of this world honey moon etc this is the place to go or even golfing holidays that would be perfect .clean was not the word they were cleanging and polishing the bins outside the hotel.
Jun 2017,30,Nice location,Pos. The hotel is situated outside of Albufera in a bay with a privat beach.Neg. 1. The rooms of the hotel need to be renovated. 2. The service personal could be more kind and politer to the guests. 3. The children around the swimming pool were very noisy.
Jun 2017,40,Great for families,We had a lovely 7 night break here. The staff couldn't have been nicer and the apartment we stayed in was really comfortable and well equipped and there are some lovely grassy areas that the children can run around and have fun where you know they are safe. It was my birthday while we were away and they surprised me with a cake and bubbley. The staff in the childrens activity area were great and my children throughly enjoyed spending a few hours there. There were plenty of pools to choose from but very cold except the one heated one that did at times get busy. My only gripe and it's a small one that it was expensive to eat for us all at the hotel but there is a great pizza place opposite the hotel. We would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to coming back.
Jun 2017,50,5 star excellence,"i cannot praise your establishment enough, everything about it is first class we stayed in a one bedroom apartment on both visits and they are lovely, so spacious and so well equiped with plenty of storage place.  all the staff are pleasant and helpful  thankyou"
Jun 2017,30,Big resort on a small beach,"Big resort-type hotel with spa, located next to a small, sandy beach in between rocks. There are rooms with balcony in the main building, and many bungalow-style apartments scattered over the premises, which come with a fully equipped kitchen. There's a mini-mart nearby. You'll either get a balcony or a terrace, directly in touch with your neighbours. The apartments have no view to the sea - we had one that looked out on the entrance of the underground parking lot. WLAN mostly worked fine, apart from inside our bedroom. Rooms were kept up well and were spotless. Some apartments are quite a walk away from reception and beach. Access to the beach is via a prison-type gate that can be passed only with the room key (unless you forgot it in your room, that is). The hotel is located rather far away from Albufeira. There is a free hotel shuttle to take you to the old town, but it doesn't run very often, seats are limited and the service ends early (last run about 6 pm). This is probably to make you dine in one of the hotel restaurants rather than choosing one of the many options in Albufeira. Our stay was blighted already one the first evening by choosing the wrong restaurant, ""O Pescador"" which seems to be the only other restaurant on the spot that doesn't belong to the hotel. They ripped us off, selling grilled fish by weight and charging us a whopping 64 EUR for a single dourada. (Once the bill arrives, you can't prove anything because you've already eaten the fish.) Of course this is not to blame on the hotel, which also couldn't help in our case. Nevertheless, it left us rather suspicious when looking for remaining options, which is limited to two pizza restaurants next to the main street. So we mostly ended up dining in the hotel (OK), or taking a taxi back from Albufeira. Three pool areas. In May, the water in the pools was rather cold, but there is one heated one in front of the main restaurant, which is consequently quite busy. The green spaces are well-kept but not overly impressive. Staff was very friendly, especially in the kid's club which also offers daily activities, some for an extra fee. The stand-up paddling (EUR 35) was a big success with the kids. Breakfast is normally one of the best experiences when going on vacation, not having to clean the dishes afterwards :-) In this hotel, the variety was enormous, and the fresh fruits a delight. On busy days, we couldn't pick the table we wanted. Most seating is indoors, without view to the sea."
Jun 2017,50,Most pleasing environment to relax in .,"Most accommodating resort , there when needed and worked diligently around the resort and never intruded on your stay. Well done and highly recommended for any family.We attended a wedding mid way through our stay and it's impeccable service."
Jun 2017,40,Last minute stay,"Booked a two bedroom apartment last minute which was for a wedding party at the venue.  Rooms were big and facilities in the room very clean.  The beds were a little hard for me and the bedding a bit scratchy.  For the price paid of 220Euros for one night it was a bit high but due to the weekend and last minute nature, literally 30 minutes, the service was very good.  Location to the beach was amazing.  Free towels for use on the beach and use of the spa facilities to shower even AFTER you have checked out.  Very VERY good hotel overall."
Jun 2017,50,Alan Cardiff,Excellant. Family holiday for third year in a row. Love the facility. Shuttle to Old Town is a great service. Hotel staff are very informative? Hotel and apartments are very secure. Will definitely stay again.
May 2017,50,lovely place to enjoy a quiet holiday!!!,well wer do i start now.. one of the best places I have stayed in. very helpful front of house staff .. helped us to book various trips and activities throughout our stay.. only thing i can really printout if i have to be really critical is maybe breakfast can be slightly improved.. apart from that everything was spot on.. also pls do not forget to book sea facing rooms as its simply awesome!!!
May 2017,50,Long Weekend,"Attended partner's inter office weekend. Nice location with easy access to beach. Pool areas well kept with plenty of space and main pools with good bar service. would give hotel a 4 star plus rating. We had a lovely suite with sea and pool views. Quiet comfortable and well kept rooms. Variety of bars restaurants with good quality food and not expensive. The staff throughout were excellent. Always friendly helpful and spoke very good English, the only exception was the housekeeper. Plenty of areas to relax around property with an excellent organized gala evening by the hotel. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend and be more than happy to return"
May 2017,40,great location,the hotel is situated on very beautiful natural grounds. The beach and ocean are wonderful. The room was stuffy and carpet needs replacing. Bed is uncomfortable. Bathroom is old and needs updating. The main area of the hotel is beautiful and the restaurants offer good food and variety.
May 2017,40,Beautiful Location,The hotel is located on an outstanding location. The main areas of the hotel itself are beautiful. The room was dated and as well as the bathroom. The bed is hard. Carpet old and worn. Hallways are stuffy. Pool is small. But the beach area is natural and beautiful. Restaurants have good variety and quality of food.
May 2017,50,wedding trip,"look no further for your wedding , trust me the organsation by the staff and service was 100%. we were guests of the couple, coaches took use to nearby chapel and back the hotel , views, weather,organisation were best ever, not forgetting the staff and portuguese people in general were 100%"
May 2017,50,great holidays,"I recommend this hotel for everyone who wants to pass relax holidays. great comfort, food is excellent. I'm looking forward to our next stay in this hotel. pool and beach also excellent. rooms are comfortably."
May 2017,50,beautiful hotel,"stayed in main hotel room spotless and spacious breakfast great,apartments also lovely, staff very helpful, a large complex with lots to do, very good for families and taxi to old/new town only seven euro."
May 2017,50,Great reasort and great staff,"I'd visited the beach at Santa Eulalia previously and had lunch in the hotels restaurant by the beach. As guests told us it was a lovely hotel, we decided to check it out on the internet and then we decided to book a stay here. I stayed with my family for Easter and the week afterwards. The hotel itself is lovely. Its situated on a really nice beach and considering how near it is to Albufeira, it seems like its a world away from there.  The hotel has all the facilities that you would expect from a 5 star rated establishment. The Rooms we had were clean and comfortable, the food in the restaurants is food, the public areas a large and clean, the gym and spa are top quality, there's plenty of parking and the hotel provides a shuttle bus into Albufeira town centre, or you can walk there in 20 minutes. The guests at Easter were mainly Spanish or Portuguese, but the following week seemed to be more British and north European. All the staff speak English and a variety of other languages, but it was there helpfulness that most impressed me. My parents wanted to go to Fatima and they helped arrange that trip, I pulled a muscle in my back and not only did they help me find a chiropractor, but one of the staff members brought me their own tube of Voltarel Gel, which was amazingly kind. I would definitely recommend this place and hopefully will return in the near future."
May 2017,40,Lovely Hotel,Lovely hotel little bit out the way from everything so took taxis on to town lovely beach and breakfast was good 😊 Pool is smaller then some properties of the size but didn't see many children so it was a pleasure to sit around. Rooms are lovely I was in the main building so had the view of the sea I love Algarve and can't wait to visit again soon x
May 2017,20,This is how it really is,The good pointsNice placeGood reception staffGood roomAND THENThis is not 5  star don't be expecting the treatment . We stayed 19 to 26 May I was not impressed at all .The food was only at the best average  cold . Don't worry nobody is interested .The staff don't care unless you are in a big group a very poor performance.What  is going on at happy hour at the bar you are  unable to by a large beer but can only by 2 small ones ( perhaps a jobs worth or a you no what)All in all had a good time but won't be going back not to this hotelAnd then there was the very large group of people that turned up on Thursday the most arrogant people I have ever met. The hotel don't care for couples you have been warnedIf you go good luck
May 2017,40,Excellent hotel,This hotel is amazing  would highly recommend it lovely staff we will defently be returning next year rooms are lovely and clean pool area is amazing close to beach close to town centre lots to do for all ages
May 2017,20,Disappointing ,We paid extra for a sea view room as it was our 10th wedding anniversary and had high expectations with it being 5*. Sadly a conference was booked for the same period so we were not allowed onto the pool side as the conference had their evening meal there. Then we could not sleep for the volume of the music at the disco that they had on the pool side post dinner.  The conference should have been held in a conference room and not in the public areas that we have a right to have access to. Also no tea and coffee facilities in the room. A bottle of water is €4. A chocolate is left on your bed each day but if you've not eaten the days before you don't get given another one. Buffet breakfast is varied but all pre cooked. No fresh cooking of omelettes or poached eggs or making of smoothies. Very unlike other 5* hotels we have stayed at.
May 2017,50,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel, cant fault in anyway!Staff/food/service was 100%Have booked this hotel for my wedding next year and can't wait to get back.Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area."
May 2017,40,Short early summer visit,"Stayed for three nights after a week near Portimao.  Many aspects of the hotel are 5 star but the apartment deco and tv services were not 5 star for me, I think I'm too used to digital tv and English channels at other hotels.  Pools lovely, walk to beach short, lovely Alantico restaurant for breakfast overlooking the beach.  A few too many ants in the bathroom for me to give 5 star."
May 2017,50,Fellowship Convention with 150 ppl,"2nd time ive stayed at this hotel and the experience is one that ranks well in my top 5 of hotel stays. The service and attention to detail when you enquire is very good, the staff are polite and are willing to do what-ever it takes to sort the problem. Rooms were really nice, well kept, house keeping was amazing, standard of cleanliness was very good. Food was out of this world, i have some specific requirements etc like Gluton free and stuff and they were able to accommodate this no problem. Would highly recommend this hotel for couples, family or just a bunch of friends. Will be back next year."
May 2017,40,"Special location, lovely hotel.","The location of this hotel makes it a perfect place to holiday. Walk through the hotel grounds to a lovely beach. The hotel facilities are expensive but no more than other 5 star hotels. The food we had was excellent. Staff friendly and willing to help. The bed was very comfortable, my only complaint was that there were no tea making facilities in the room. Everything else was excellent."
May 2017,40,Great holiday location away from tourists!,Great place to stay if you want to relax away from hustle and bustle. Free shuttle takes you to the new and old town at regular intervals if you do want to go into busier area's but its lovely to stay on the quiet beach or pool side here. We were there May 2017 the weather was fab and the resort not yet at full capacity.
May 2017,50,Wonderful experience in Grande Real Santa Eulalia.,"We stayed in the self catering apartments on the grounds of this hotel for one week with our two young children aged 3 and 2. We chose the half board option and the food choice was wonderful in the buffet. The children had a fantastic time and enjoyed the Kids Club, the swimming pools and the proximity to the beach. There is a courtesy bus which brings you to and from Albufeira which was a service we used most days. The staff are friendly and accommodating and we also availed of the babysitting service. Overall we had a very pleasant stay at the hotel and we hope to be back again soon."
May 2017,50,Relaxing,"Great place. Especially impressed with the Spa. Such a relaxing atmosphere. Thalassotherapy treatments wonderful, fantastic massage and good range of beauty treament. Friendly, helpful and courteous staff. Rooms comfortable, spotlessly clean and apartments with a well equipt kitchenette. Direct access to the beach."
May 2017,40,Beautiful beach and warm pool,A beautiful resort with easy access to a lovely beach. Apartments are spacious and well furnished but ours was let down by a bad smell (faulty drains / sewers ?). Breakfast offered a wide selection of hot and cold food. Staff were helpful and efficient. A couple of good restaurants immediately outside the resort entrance and lots more nearby (half mile walk uphill).
May 2017,50,Dave and Elaine from Northumberland,"We gayer here from the 7th of May 2017 for 11 nights we real enjoyed our stay the best part is the buetiful location,the hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful,the only slight fault are the rooms are a bit dated."
May 2017,50,Great spot,Fantastic few days away in this hotel staff we're fantastic food is great and location just outside the main strip was great with only a short taxi journey costin €3-4 euro away and spa treatment was a nice touch
May 2017,50,Fabulous week in studio apartment,"We recently got back from a week at the Grande Real and we had a great time. We stayed in a studio apartment, there was myself my wife and our 5 year old son. We actually booked the studio by accident as I'm an idiot and thought I was booking a suite but never noticed till it was too late. I was actually not looking forward to it but I was so wrong! We had a great time and the apartment was great it was just the right size for our family, I think if there was two kids you might be struggling for space a bit but it would be possible. The apartment was spotless and was cleaned on a daily basis by very friendly housekeeping. There was water,milk and sweets on the table when we arrived which was a nice touch. There was a bathroom, small hall area and then a kitchenette/dining area with two sofa beds and a small table open plan with the bedroom. In the bedroom there was a double wardrobe which contained the safe which was free to use. In the kitchen there were pots/pans oven/hob fridge cutlery etc., although we never had to use any of it, it was all in good condition and I would have no hesitation using any of them.The balcony was just beside the main bed and had two seats and a small table. We didn't use the balcony much as it didn't get much sun but it looked out onto a grassy area and two small swimming pools and was nice to sit on nonetheless. The main hotel is lovely and is again spotless, all the staff that we came into contact with were very professional and helpful and were always willing to go the extra mile. We were on half board which meant we got 7 vouchers at the beginning of the week that could be used for either lunch or dinner in the main buffet restaurant. We also received vouchers for towels that you can exchange next to reception, at the end of the day you hand the towels back and get your vouchers returned ready for the next day. The food throughout our stay was superb, the buffet is not like your normal offering of a meat/pasta/fish dish with varying sauces each night. They really put some thought into their meals and there was always a large choice to choose from. Our son was a bit picky with what they offered as they don't really cater for kids on the buffet but they do have a separate a la carte kids menu which is included in your half board which was great. We also ate in the other restaurants a couple of times and the food was equally as good.We used the free shuttle bus to go back and forward to the old town one day and the service was excellent. There is also a couple of supermarkets nearby and also some restaurants if you want but we didn't try any of them as there was no need.The beach is a 5 min walk from the hotel through a private gate that you access with your room card and the beach itself is lovely, clean and not too busy. The beach is open to the public but it was certainly not busy, it may get busy at peak times though. The spa looked ok, the only thing I used was the thalasso circuit which to be honest was nothing special as a few of the bits of equipment weren't working (they gave me a 2 Euro discount!!) I probably wouldn't bother if I went back.The outdoor pools - we only really used the three main ones outside the main hotel, there was the heated pool a non heated pool and a splash pool for the babies. The non heated pool was freezing so stayed away from that but the other two were great and never too busy. There was always sunbeds to find and there wasn't the usual towel brigade first thing in the morning, later in the week the hotel was getting quite busy and I could see how you might struggle to get one in peak season.The only thing that let the whole thing down were some of the other guests during our last few days, just being loud and obnoxious at the pool, playing loud music etc. not the hotels fault but it was a shame to spoil the relaxing atmosphere we experienced the first half of the week."
May 2017,50,Outstanding,Very nice location Staff very friendly and very helpful Easy access to the beach Breakfast very good and lots of it Rooms nice and beds very comfortable Cold and heated swimming pools which was good as it was very hot
May 2017,40,Beautiful,"Absolutely gorgeous resort with the most friendly, smart and helpful staff!!! The place is made up of a hotel and apartment blocks. We stayed in one of the self catering studio apartments...the decor yes, it's bright but it's inoffensive and the room was unbelievably clean! There are a number of swimming pools to choose from, close to the apartments and in the main hotel area. We stayed B&B and breakfast was served 7-10.30am - the earlier you get the better as it isn't so busy!! The food - some very tasty, some not - depends what you like. There is however a wide variety to choose from so always something for everyone. There's direct access to the beautiful santa eulalia beach, absolutely worth a visit!! The small play park came in handy for my two year old who loves to play out...my only criticism is that on a night time the hotel isn't particularly child friendly - I'm not sure if it was the time of year we visited (too early?) but there was not entertainment for kids, no game room they could play in - considering there seemed to be a lot of families staying here I would think there would be something. This would be a huge suggestion to the hotel - it would perhaps encourage people to spend more time at the hotel on an evening!!"
May 2017,50,Great holiday,Amazing time was had great hotel and super for my 3 year old granddaughter pools were super rooms spotless and huge great sea view breakfast was really good too reception catered for all our need and towels supplied too
May 2017,40,Almost there!,We have a family of four with two little children (1+4) we enjoy our stay and also our kids. The things that Could be better are: breakfast is always the same and after 12 days your tired of eggs and bacon etc. The pools where cold. The rest is perfect and we are considering to come in the future again.
May 2017,50,Excellent hotel but could be better,"The hotel is on a large complex with many apartments for self catering options. They are cleaned daily and towels and toiletries were replenished. Our apartment had all the facilities needed for a pleasant stay however the pillows are too small and there was a smell of damp I in the bedroom wardrobe. Each block of apartments had their own swimming pool which was very clean with ample sun beds and umbrellas.  There is a beach which the brochure says is 90 metres away (I assume from the hotel reception). However, it does not mention that there are a total of 102 steps in total to go down to reach the beach which even for a reasonably fit person is quite a trek.  Once at the beach, you then have to pay 10 euros to hire two sun beds and an umbrella for the day. For those on a self catering basis as we were, there is no supermarket on the site and the nearest one was approximately 200 metres up the road.  The hotel itself is immaculate and the staff friendly and helpful and even take you and your luggage to your apartment on a small electric buggy."
May 2017,50,"Excellent hotel, great location, good food","We had a very pleasant stay in 1 of the apartments. The breakfast was excellent and we were so happy to see how clean everything was! Perfect service and great staff, the location is fantastic near the beach! Can really recommend this resort!"
May 2017,50,Great place,"Our first stay in Portugal at this hotel was impressive. Great staff service at anytime. Apartment was neat and tidy, cleaned daily. Facilities were brilliant, although pool was very cold. Unexpected birthday gifts from the staff was a memorable gesture."
May 2017,40,Hotel stay,Good stay close to the beach. Room was basic but nice and clean. Staff were nice. Good shuttle service to old town and new town and nice restaurants and supermarkets within walking distance. Would recommend.
May 2017,50,Thank you Grande Real,"What a totally wonderful experience- would recommend to anyone!Lovely staff, clean accommodation, fantastic food and amazing surroundings. This holiday was really good value for money.I will be returning soon."
May 2017,50,Amazing holiday!!,"This hotel is perfect! Ideal for families, the pools in the complex are great and the private beach is beautiful. Good selection iof food at breakfast. Hotel staff are very pleasant and helpful. Location of hotel is good, a few shops and restaurants within close walking distance and bus shuttle to old town is great, it's only 8 euros in a taxi to the old town. Rooms are cleaned daily and passes for clean  beach / pools towels each day is great. Can't wait to go back."
May 2017,50,Fantastic Hotel. Attentive service & Friendly staff. We can't wait to return.,This Hotel/Resort was recommended by a friend. Myself and my husband have enjoyed one week at this beautiful resort. From the moment you arrive the staff are so welcoming & helpful. We requested a Sea view room & were not disappointed.In my opinion I would love to see a walk in shower. But nevertheless we will both be returning. When we departed we felt very relaxed.Thank you!
May 2017,50,Fantastic accomodation that could not be bettered.,"The Grande Real is beyond approach for its accommodation and its facilities. This is true 5 Star. However, on the down side, its 5 Star rating causes 5 Star prices in its restaurants, prices that are beyond to ability of normal people who on a normal income and not on expense accounts to afford. This encourages us normal people to have to leave the complex and spend our hard earned income elsewhere."
May 2017,50,Very friendly staff. ,"The hotel is in a great location, close to Alfeira center, on the beach w a lot of amenities.  We had a great time and will definitely come back.  The staff is very nice and polite, and they go the extra mile to help.  Good restaurants, live music most nights, beautiful beach and lots of activities to kids and adults."
May 2017,50,Brilliant stay at the beautiful Grande Real Santa Eulalia! Our second time here and we had such a brilliant holiday!,"Brilliant family holiday! Our second time to stay here and we will stay again. Staff so friendly & helpful, kids club facilities excellent & staff are amazing with the kids. Our apartment was lovely and all our requests were completed. Thanks so much 😊"
May 2017,50,Unforgettable,Omg. Wat a beautiful place. Booked a studio resort appt and was upgraded to one bedroom appt.  The appt was very well equipped . Bed was comfortable  and room cleaned daily.  The appt was right beside pool which was lovely.  Pool area very quiet at this time but suited us . Free bus to Albufeira was so handy. Breakfast was fantastic and well worth including.would definitely return again at this time of year.
May 2017,50,Amazing,"The hotel was amazing!! Very clean?!I lived in the apartments and we had a 2 bedroom pool view,Everything was special! The staff are also very friendly and its around a 10 minute walk to the main strip and around 8 euros in a taxi to old town!"
May 2017,50,MICHAEL WOOD,Excellent service staff very polite  and helpful the room was very clean and tidy  reception staff very kind and helpful location of hotel very good bed very comfortable we really enjoyed the foodgreat system of transport to hotel rooms
May 2017,40,Grande Real  5* ?,"A very pleasant stay, staff very good, clean, food not all that good, breakfast poor quality had better in 3*. Is this a 5* hotel  overall no i don`t think it is although i would consider going again.."
May 2017,50,Lovely ,Had a lovely 2 night break here after checking out of our horrid rental apartment! Staff were friendly and v helpful including allowing us to check in at 9.30 am as room was ready. Beach us stunning but it's not a private beach as some reviews suggest. Bedrooms comfortable and thalassotherapy spa pool a delight
May 2017,50,fantastic hotel,I have just returned from this fab hotel I stayed with my partner and our 4 year old boy in the 1bed villa it was lovely in decoration had plenty of space as well as fully functional kitchen with everything needed the pool areas where spotless and the heated pool a gem when swimming early in the day we didn't not eat at the restaurant but all the food looked fantastic we just like the old town to much  there is a free bus down to the strip or the old town a couple of times a day which is great asset all the staff where really friendly and even the cleaners had a smile on there face all day  I will be back next year without a doubt and already recommended to my parents for later this year
May 2017,50,Amazing hotel,Fantastic family hotel. Amazing resort and facilities...especially pool and kids club. Lovely staff. We will be back. Thank you everyone for a wonderful trip. The apartments are great and spotless and the food was fabulous
May 2017,50,"Great hotel, great facilities","Lovely hotel.Lovely staff.Great beach nearby.Free bus to old & new town.Well staffed kids club, with nice staff.Excellent food selection.Immaculately clean.If you want to stay in Albufeira, close to everywhere you would like to see. This is the hotel for you."
May 2017,50,Relaxing stay,"Just come back , having had 3 days here. I normally always have some kind of constructive criticism but not this time.This hotel is perfect for couples, older families , the bedrooms are very spacious & have lots of wardrobe space , only down side was we had to ask for a kettle & it came with no cups , so the bar gave us these tiny espresso cups to use The beach is a 2 min walk from the hotel which is very clean, it has a cafe where you can purchase takeaway drinks to have on the beachThe new town is a 10 minute walk from the hotel which has restaurant , bars , not really ideal for young families The wifi in the hotel was very good & service overall was excellentBreakfast was as good , had everything you would want , cereal, croissant, toast , cakes , cheeses, full cooked breakfast ( sausages weren't up to much ) , juices etcLots of space around the hotel , so would think In peak season it would be ok too.We will definitely return to this hotel one day, many thanks"
May 2017,30,Quiet hotel by the beach,"I stayed here in April 2017 for a week.The location is great as the hotel is on the beach, you just have to walk a few meters until you reach the sand. However no chairs nor umbrellas are available from the hotel, you have to pay extra. I met the person in charge at the beach restaurant and he was quite helpful.The hotel is rather 4-stars than 5-stars. My room was spacious, clean and had a very nice balcony. Staff are helpful and polite. The gym is very well equipped, both for fitness and for weight training. I had a massage at the spa, which was quite relaxing.The spa pool is charged, which does not make sense in a 5-star hotel, especially when there is no other indoor pool.The breakfast was good, though not as much offer as you would expect in a 5-star hotel. Service was good and efficient.I didn't eat at the restaurants apart from breakfast but prices were quite high. You can easily find good and affordable restaurants close by. Paulus Pizzeria is lovely.The bar by the beach is quite nice, even if it's windy you can stay inside."
May 2017,50,ANOTHER AMAZING STAY!!!!!!,HELLO JUST BACK FROM ANOTHER AMAZING WEEK AT THIS HOTEL .Myself and my wife have stayed at the grande real no fewer than 10 times so i might be biased but we cannot fault this hotel we stay in an apartment in the garden and it is beautiful .The apartments are serviced daily we had a lady called Allana who is fantastic the apartment itself is spacious with all that you need .Would have to say to anyone who is not hiring a car for your trip albuferia ie fishermans beach and old town would be a taxi journey so be prepared for that but i understand the hotel offers a bus in and out although not sure about times etc would check with hotel first .Lots of food options at hotel but wouldnt say it was that cheap food and drink are expensive but the views from the terrace are stunning just to finish there are 2 restaurants just outside the hotel martins and a new pizza restaurant have never eat here so cannot comment .
May 2017,20,May holiday,"Booked this through jet 2 holidays. They stated it was a family hotel with evening entertainment and private beach. Well definitely not!. The le club disco was closed therefore downstairs they just had a very very expensive bar with football on and sometimes a poor singer .nothing for children.the 'private beach' was open to the public and other hotels.the hotel holds conference meetings every few days so therefore the hotel is taken over with hundreds of suited & booted people and outside is full of cars parked on the path all the way down as a result of all these business people.the kids club is just a babysitting service for parents who can't be bothered and to get to it you walk outside in the rain. Nothing in the hotel itself when it's raining for children. Breakfast food (cooked breakfast & pancakes ) always cold . The cakes are nice but not much choice in cereal or healthy food.. The staff in the breakfast buffet need cheering up . The food and drinks are way too expensive . 10 Euro for a salad 15 Euro for 2 vodkas and Pepsi in the restaurant by the beach . The pergula restaurant cost 62 Euro for 2 adult burgers and 1 child. Overpriced for very average food . . Albufiera town is a 10 minute walk away. The streets are littered with rubbish & graffiti . The bars and restaurants cater for   drunk people who just want junk food after a night out. It's like the benidorm of portugal. Definitely wouldn't recommend it for family's.The old town is slightly better but not pretty how you would expect an old town to be . Very littered and dirty again. We even had a man shouting at English people come and get your of pg  tips and your double egg sausage bacon, with a fag hanging out his mouth. Overall thanks to jet 2 who don't provide holiday reps even on the coach getting here we didn't know where the driver was stopping because he didn't speak . No notice board in the hotel or any reps at all to book excursions or give advice. And thank-you for a false description of the hotel & holiday . We will not be returning and will definitely not use jet 2 again."
May 2017,50,"lovely hotel, beautiful location,","This was a lovely hotel, rooms were spacious and very clean.  Lovely location and very easy to get into the main town. Lovely and very helpful staff.  The pool areas and bars were excellent with ample places to spend time by the pool."
May 2017,50,An outstanding resort!,"From the first moment to the last the staff could not have been more helpful, making our stay most enjoyable. The atmosphere within the resort was friendly and welcoming with lots to do. Good value for money."
May 2017,50,Another fantastic stay at the Grande Real,"Just back from our second stay at this beautiful resort. I really can’t fault this place. The Staff are friendly and efficient, the grounds are beautifully maintained. The food is delicious. We stayed during the first week of May and the resort was fairly quiet during the week but got quite busy at the weekend (not sure if this was due to Portuguese Mother’s Day). We spent lots of time around the pool and at the beautiful sandy beach which is accessed through a security gate. The location is brilliant with the Old Town just a ten minute complimentary bus ride away (less than 10 Euros if you get a taxi) and the New Town is even closer. You can also walk to the restaurants in the Oura area which are lovely too.  Perfect Hotel, amazing location, we hope to return next year."
May 2017,50,Another great stay at The Grande Real in Santa Eulalia,"Excellent and up to the usual high standards, We love coming back to enjoy the total experience of the hotel, the professional service, the weather and the beautiful bar area overlooking the sea. Keep it up. Thank you, Noel and Bernie"
May 2017,50,Wonderful stay near to the beach,"It was a good holiday to relaxe, even when the temperature is not so warm outside you can enjoy the spa with his nice warm swimming pool, even if it is charged by 20€ extra what is expensive!- in the bathroom there is not enough light on the mirror to do your makeup  and you don't have a magnifying mirror!"
May 2017,50,Relax at Santa Eulalia,"Lovely Hotel/apartments The reception area is large and airy. The outdoor areas are overlooking the beach. Lovely location. Spotlessly clean throughout .Smiling, helpful, experienced staff .Ideal for families. Only downfall really is the overpriced food and drink."
May 2017,40,"Beautiful, but unfortunately no sea view from apartments.","Beautifully located Hotel, nice infrastructure, nice surrounding. Apartments nice and spaceous, but unfortunately no sea view from apartments. Beautiful beach and nature nearby. Restaurants too expensive."
May 2017,50,Great hotel,"Nice room, great swimming pools, private access to beach. My kids love the kids facilities there, the table tennis, tennis training, kids' swimming pools, small football pitch, etc. We spent three days there firstly and came back later for another 5days within a week."
May 2017,50,Thank you!,"We greatly appreciated the nice attention for the birthday of my husband. It was really very kind of you.Unless, we spent some days very nice in this region from Faro to St-Vincent. Thank you very much."
May 2017,40,Great spot and service!,"Great spot and some of the most friendly staff! We really enjoyed the small town atmosphere of the resort. The accommodations were clean and well presented too. Get the burger at their restaurant. Most of all, the beach access is perfect!"
May 2017,40,a really enjoyable time ...staff terrefic,"Had a really good time, food ambience views great bar and a great people place.  I think u may have to rethink the approach to the spa which was not the best, that aside we are coming back again to your hotel next year please God......and we never go back to the same PLACE"
May 2017,40,Nice hotel,"Nice hotel, booked sea view suit which was 2 bedroom and 2 full size bathrooms with aircon, plenty of space for 4, had a problem with aircon on arrival which was sorted within the hour, nice pool area, no fighting for sunbeds and plenty still available at 10 am,  beach was great and beach bar for lunch which is part of hotel was nice with good views out to sea, all in all a nice hotel, little out the way, was 20 minute walk to bottom of strip, taxi was bout 3 euros, entertainment  at night was a bit ropey, if they did a mini disco for kid then maybe we would not have gone out everynight"
May 2017,50,Beautiful hotel,"What can I say. everything from the minute we arrived was perfect staff, food, location perfect, seaveiw room is a must. Maybe tea/coffee facilities in the room would be perfect . Love to return soon."
May 2017,50,Fab Wedding Weekend,"Stayed here for four nights last weekend.. had a beautiful suite, used the spa too for a couples massage and it was superb. The breakfast is 5 star... our friends got married and the overall venue and experience was so fabulous. Couldn't recommend it enough"
May 2017,50,Great Holiday with two friends,"Hi AllMy wife and I along with two friends booked this holiday with Love holidays for a week of 14th of March 2017 at this great hotel.No problems with love holidays all the paper work was correct and we headed off from Newcastle airport with easy jet,only one small problem we found on the flight was the trolly dollies both pushed their trollies from the back of the plane straight to the front and started serving from there leaving us at the back with not much left.choice(row23)Anyway we landed then straight onto our private transfers about 30mins drive to the hotel its big and very impressive booked in no problem we had asked for 2 apartments together we got 595 &593 just next door to each other on ground floor.Lovely staff they call for a golf buggy to take you and your baggage to your apartment ,which is a great idea no wondering around in the dark trying to find your place.We booked self catering the apartment has everything you require for that type of holiday,lovely clean apartment,nice beds and pillows,,room cleaned every day again nice friendly cleaning staff.The hotel is right on the beach front with quite easy access down to the beach,anice beach front restaurant lovely ice cream hmmmmm,,we had a few meals and snacks in there.Its was early March so the hotel wasn't full but its was still nice for sitting round the pool, lots of sunbeds with great views over the bay,,,lots of big pools also kiddies poolsThe hotel lounge had entertainers on most nights and check out the cocktails but watch out some have a kick,you can also get snacks there.Overall we found it a very relaxing holiday with a great apartment and lovely hotel set in great ground .And yes we will return later this year,,,,all the best the Geordies."
May 2017,50,Weekend Conference,"Resort is spread over a large area giving you lots of space so you don't feel over whelmed by lots of people. Facilities are modern and well maintained, swimming pool and surrounding areas are cleaned and tidy. Location of the resort is ideal for the beach and local amenities. Quality of food is fantastic!"
May 2017,40,algarve exploration,"This 5 stars reso is Well placet East of Albufeira. Three is a shuttle To The city centre. The resort is super ,room cozy And roomy  with  all The comfort.  Ask forse a seaview  one.  Albufeira is strategically  placet To allow You To Explore both east as well West.  The hotel is actually on a Nice Sandy Beach.  But if You preferenze The Three pool these are perfect with seaview. And one is heated. Food  Excellent. For My taste I would rather avoid Albufeira And rather consider tavira or Lagos or villamoura. Albufeira in August is probabile too crowded And turistic. You would probably enjoy more your resort."
Apr 2017,50,"Lovely hotel, good location, great staff","Stayed in an art mentioned for one night to meet some family. Staff are outstanding, friendly and helpful.  Hotel is in good position with good facilities, clean and modern. Would recommend this property to anyone."
Apr 2017,50,Very nice!,"Normally don't do reviews but other reviews helped me!Very nice hotel,decent location,excellent staff,private clean beach,heated pools a bonus for children. Burger restaurant excellent. Carpet in room needs cleaning but apart from that very impressive"
Apr 2017,50,Excellent,"We stayed for a week over the easter holidays with our 8year old, could not fault anything really. Hotel was in a fab position right on the beach with a bar and restaurant directly on the beach. We stayed in the hotel with a lovely seaview. Food was very good. We did not find the drinks expensive especially when you are in such a nice hotel.Only thing i would say was that the pools were quite cold but that didn't bother my daughter.   Will definitely return."
Apr 2017,40,Good but so expensive ,Attended a wedding here. The place is beautiful with a private beach and lovely grounds. The staff are very welcoming too. Room was clean and we were happy to receive a complimentary bottle of bubbly as it was my birthday when we arrived. The only negative was the pricing of food and drink. We arrived in late and grabbed the buffet which was luke warm at best and a bottle of rose which is about 4€ in the local shop so when we went to pay we were shocked at the €87 bill. Two person buffet and a bottle of rose. The second night of the wedding they sold 30cl glasses of beer for €4 which is simply extortionate.It's a pity because it is a wonderful hotel with lovely staff. Anyway if you're staying here expect expensive food and drink but a good hotel and service.
Apr 2017,50,Fantastic,"I spent a lovely week with my daughter over the Easter holidays. All the staff were professional, accommodating, extremely helpful and kind. From the start of our check in David was so kind and gracious! Paula in the restaurant was so chatty with my daughter and every morning taught her Portuguese greetings. The staff at the Kids Club were so friendly that everyday my daughter wanted to go there for their many adventures. I had a wonderfully exquisite massage and enjoyed the Spa. To be honest I have no complaints whatsoever. We were spoilt rotten;-) We enjoyed our stay so much we are already planning another visit next year!"
Apr 2017,50,Great stay!,"We just returned last Friday from a week at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia. This is a great hotel, it's everything you might need with young kids (we have 3, including a 1 year old) - there's a heated pool, kids club, playground, beach is right on your doorstep, there is great ease in a family holiday here. The staff are warm and friendly (e.g. our 2 boys kept asking for rides on the golf carts and the staff always obliged!) We will definitely be returning! The apartments are in a traditional Portugese style (but kitted our in lots of orange and green - a bit bright for my taste but hey . . .). 10 min walk (some uphill) to the supermarket in Albufeira new town. V easy to get taxis, our little one was sick - we got a doctors' appointment within the hour and it cost €50. All very efficient and stress-free. Very pleased to recommend and will definitely return!  Also there's a reasonably good family restaurant just outside the gates on the main road (100 metres to the left) if you want to get out of the hotel compound but don't want to go into Albufeira itself."
Apr 2017,50,Fabulous Resort,"Stayed here for a week with my family and had the most relaxing holiday.  Stunning place, immaculate with really friendly staff. Would highly recommend this hotel. We opted for the self catering apartment and the facilities provided were great"
Apr 2017,50,Awesome,"Great hotel, good food, amazing staff, private beach. Heated pool was a bit small and they could have provided hot water showers near the pool. Otherwise an awesome stay!!!Breakfast options were great but again they were same every day, could have introduced some variety."
Apr 2017,50,Lovely service and beautiful hotel,"Hotel seems perfect if you want an all-inclusive family holiday to relax and not go out much. I was there with a friend for a conference, the atmosphere was very nice, but there was not too much of interest beyond the hotel nearby, and the town Albufeira seemed extremely touristy. If you are not interested in much local cultural history, than this place is lovely for a seaside holiday."
Apr 2017,50,Would definitely return again!,"Outstanding hotel with friendly,helpful staff. Food was delicious and stunning grounds too. Beautiful beach right at the foot of the hotel which wasn't crowded at all. The hotel brought me a birthday cake and bottle of fizz on my birthday night which was so kind too. A really lovely place to stay away from the centre which all looked rather run down and tired. Would recommend to anyone and the pizza place Portabellos opposite the hotel was fabulous Italian food and the owners are lovely."
Apr 2017,50,Grse,"Hotel resort is fantastic ideal location, apartments are great modern and very clean.Food was fantastic good choice all thats missing is a childrens menu, expensive to eat at hotel tho.Other than that i highly recomend."
Apr 2017,40,Luxury,"We stayed over easter at this resort which is set at Santa Eulalia Beach. It offered all we asked for: relaxation, nice food, great hospitality and comfortable extra's like the spa, the fitness room and massage.We stayed only four nights, but it worked as a complete holiday considering the relaxation."
Apr 2017,50,"Very nice, high-quality hotel with a stunning sea-view","The hotel is located in Albufeira, about 35 minutes drive by taxi from Faro Airport. A smooth taxiservice ia available from the airport to the hotel via the company FlexiTravel.The hotel is located very near to the beach, and is a worldclass hotel, with nice, bright and clean rooms, good and very polide service in the lobby and around the hotel. Several pools are located just outside the hotel and otherwise the beach is 5 minutes walk away. We had a sea-view room with an extremely nice view over the sea, and a chance to sit at the terrace and just enjoy the view and the nice sound of the waves breaking along the coast line. It does not get much better than this, even at Hawaii, where I have also been several times.The hotel offer one of the best breakfast buffets I have experienced in my 26+ years of travelling worldwide. Really nice view and excellent local fruits are available, their pinapple is 6-star. For lunch, the assortment is somewhat more limited, if you want more than a snack, to eat.I booked a couple of tours in the reception, a foto tour along the Algarve coast line and a trip to Gibraltar. In both cases, I got picked up by a bus, just outside the hotel gate. Worked very well.The rooms are big and nice, with air con, and does even have a single really good chair to sit in. There is a free and well-working wifi. Only drawback: the bed was way to hard for me. But the rest is definitely 5-star, and I recommend it highly."
Apr 2017,50,Looking forward to returning😊,This was our second time staying here. Love being that bit outside of Albufeira and enjoyed the walk in every evening. Love the facilities and ambience of the hotel. Staff are very helpful and friendly. We were offered free upgrade which we were delighted with. Room was big with patio to garden and side view of beach. Can't wait to go back next year hopefully
Apr 2017,50,Amazing.,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The service was excellent, food was varied and delicious, and there was plenty for my 6 year old son to do. It was relaxing, quiet, and a perfect week away! The location was fantastic. Close to Faro and Albufeira but away from the hustle and bustle; right on a quiet beach...wonderful!"
Apr 2017,30,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Spa,"Outside the hotel entrance is fully cobbled and therefore unpleasant to walk on Rooms are basic and are colourfully decorated. There is plenty of wardrobe space but lacking sufficient clothes hangers. The bathroom mirror is set back a long way so shaving and application of makeup requires a hand mirror, otherwise there is a bath with a shower and a reasonable hair dryer. There was an abundance of towels but there was a noisy ventilation fan which may explain the steamy mirror! The hotel communal areas are spacious and airy and the reception staff are very obliging. Unfortunately the serving staff in the restaurants need a course in customer care and cheerfulness. The food in general was OK in variation but quality fell down in some areas such as the breakfast cereal which poor and the bacon which was very tough and hard to chew.The location is absolutely lovely and the general ambiance is very pleasant. Overall a very pleasant hotel but with small niggles that could be easily remedied"
Apr 2017,40,Great hotel,Spent one week at santa eulalia. Didn't really expect too much but was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. Good pointsNear faro airport so quick transfer (30mins)Room was everything we needed. Spoke to the hotel before arrival to discuss our needs (limited mobility guest) and everything was catered for.Stayed full board in the restaurant buffet meals three times a day. Everything was tasty although flavoured (spiced) to suit all pallets so a wee bit bland. Restaurant also cared for fussy child without a problemGreat beachGreat poolsGreat evening entertainment. We were there during the Easter holidays and he following weeks entertainment was not so good.Kids loved the kids clubAll staff were excellent and friendly.Bad points Can think of anyWe will be staying again.
Apr 2017,40,Conference weekend,"Excellent facilities, welcoming and efficient staff, apartments were large, clean and comfortable. Good location and nicely spread out in the grounds so you didn't feel on top of each other. Excellent for the beach/nice walks with shops and restaurants within easy walk away this hotel had everything!"
Apr 2017,50,Excellent hotel,We have just come back from a lovely week in the Grand Real.  Hotel is lovely.  The staff are all very friendly.  Breakfast is delicious.  The services are excellent.  The whole atmosphere is nice and relaxed.
Apr 2017,50,My first solo trip ...outstanding,"For a variety of reasons I decided to venture on a solo mini-trip and boy did I pick a fabulous place to spend 4 glorious days. This hotel is outstanding on every level...staff, facilities, location....I hadn't even checked out when I wanted to check back in again !! superb place and I cannot recommend it highly enough."
Apr 2017,50,Business and Leisure,"The Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa is an excellent Hotel, located at the Atlantic ocean with a short Access to the beach and excellent food. The appartments located near to the road are a liitle bit noisy due to leaks in the window closing."
Apr 2017,40,typical good resort,very well equipped resort with all facilities required; everything makes a used impression but is well maintained; multiple pools and direct access to a (public) beach; (reasonable) entertainment programs for kids & adults; Albufeira reachable by a (long; 1h; along the coast) walk or by bus.
Apr 2017,40,Eileen and Paul from Dublin.,We loved this hotel. The staff (with the exception of a couple of the main bar staff who were unhelpful and devoid of any personality) in general were fantastic. Happy to help and good at their jobs. The location was excellent. The bed was so comfy. Entertainment at nighttime was nothing to write home about to be honest but it didnt really affect us too much.
Apr 2017,50,Great hotel,Great hotel staff were really friendly. The hotel facilities were great. Hotel was close to the beach and offered lots of choice to eat and relax. The hotel also provided a free shuttle bus that took you to the old & new town
Apr 2017,50,Excellent stay!,"Highly recommended, food and drink a little on the expensive side, that is my only criticism, the breakfast buffet is an absolute must to include along with your booking, the staff are very friendly and approachable, the hotel is spotless and very comfortable and the location is right next to a beautiful beach, nothing more to say other than we will be back!"
Apr 2017,40,Very pleased,"Place where you can relax in peace, we were nicely treated by the staff. My children liked the resort very much,  and the swimming pool. Everything very handy, lots of bars and restaurants with good quality food, private access to the beach."
Apr 2017,50,nice family stay,"overall very good impression,  food was excellent, nice and clean place,dining room too crowded and noisy, too many people at buffet, we expected better behavior and dress code of guests  at a 5 star hotel"
Apr 2017,40,A very lovely holiday,"We stayed for a week and liked the hotel, the food, the pool and fitness/spa. Employers at reception and Restaurant were all very nice and helpful, one exception was the room maid, which was very unfriendly, we don't know why...."
Apr 2017,40,A short break in Portugal,"Over the 4 days we found all aspects of the hotel, where it is, and the service to be ideal.The overall views from the various hotel balconies across the Atlantic were superb and certainly will entice us to come again."
Apr 2017,40,Short stay,"Overall my stay was enjoyable.Breakfast was very good, such variety.Hotel right on the beachHotel room needed upgradingScenery from room quite pleasant The service was very goodWeather goodTown within walking distance"
Apr 2017,50,Absolutely first class,"There is always a certain amount of anxiety when travelling to a country and hotel for the first time. The transfer to the hotel and at booking in, immediately reduced that anxiety, we were spoken to in perfect English by extremely friendly staff, in fact everyone we met was extremely friendly and helpful. The room and services were absolutely first class, the private beach was wonderful and the range of facilities was comprehensive, in fact you wouldn't need to leave the hotel at all! We absolutely loved the breakfast, the fresh fruit and cakes on offer was second to none. The location of the hotel makes visits to nearby restaurants easy, even on foot and a regular free bus runs from the hotel to old town Albufeira for shopping. Booking tours was simplified by the hotel staff and so really all you have to do is chill out and enjoy yourself. The weather during our stay in April was warm enough for us, the coastal setting frequently offers a pleasant cooling breeze, yet cloudless sky offers deep tans. It might prove too hot in the middle of summer for some. We will definitely be thinking of coming back next April, Portugal has so much to offer, beautiful scenery, food, wine and people, a real gem."
Apr 2017,40,Wonderful resort,"I would highly recommend this resort for a family holiday. The Kids Club facility was great and my children real enjoyed the activities and made new friends, and it gave my husband and I time to spend alone together knowing that the children were in safe hands.The one bedroom apartment had all the amenities needed and was big enough for the four of us and was regularly cleaned. Local supermarkets were 5-10 minute walk from resort. We would definitely visit again!"
Apr 2017,50,Beautiful place! ,"We came here on a last minute trip and brought our one year old. We stayed in the apartments which were great. We found the resort and grounds really lovely and well maintained, there were a whole bunch of pools to choose from and an easily accessible beach. It was early season so not all of the hotel restaurants and bars were open but we enjoyed the bar and we absolutely loved the breakfast - we were offered a breakfast upgrade at check in which we took and never ever regretted - breakfast was absolutely incredible. Staff were lovely and there were always plenty of staff available to help. Lots of other restaurants and bars nearby, short walk into the town. We ate out most nights."
Apr 2017,50,Fantastic,"A great experience, wonderful hotel, friendly staff and an amazing location. The beach behind the hotel is fantastic, it also has its own shuttle bus into Albufiera's new town and old town that helped us explore the local area. A perfect holiday! Would definitely go back."
Apr 2017,50,"Second visit to this resort, fantastic!","This resort is just wonderful. It's the perfect place to stay especially for those with young families. We got the studio again, perfect for our family. This time we went self catering and ate out in the evenings. The hotel facilities are great, the hotels loans towels for the pool or beach. No need to bring your own. The bus shuttle into The Old and New Town currently runs several times a day and pick ups also, free of charge. Top tip, get in the queue 20 mins before departure. The bus has around 18+ seats. To walk from the hotel to the New Town (Strip) is about 15 mins for those who like to walk. We did with a pram. A taxi from the Old Town to the hotel is around €8. The hotel has evening entertainment and music. The studios are a short walk to the main building, nice and quiet. There is only one outdoor heated pool, gets busy. The indoor pool is a part of the spa, so no kids. :(We got late check out which was a bit of a shock, €80. All in all, this is a great resort. Leading to a beautiful beach. Will be back."
Apr 2017,50,Great hotel,"Had a great time at this beautiful hotel with my extended family. Great location, very nice and clean rooms and lovely view. The beach access was also a great plus and the beach strip itself was wonderful and inviting."
Apr 2017,40,Staff very welcoming and lovely at Grande Real Santa.,"Stayed in one bedroom self-catering apartment near the road but that is no problem as cannot hear traffic. Apartment was brightly coloured not to my taste but wouldn’t say dated like most. Good size with everything we needed.  Very clean & comfy. Bed was amazing two singles together but you wouldn’t know, it was so comfy best night’s sleep ever! Showers were good, water could have been hotter but warm water never ran out. The complimentary items S/poo,showergel, body lotion,cotton wool, shower cap & nail file replaced daily was lovely touch. Our 5 day trip was a surprise for my partner’s b.day. The hotel staff put a b.day cake & bottle of lovely champagne in our room on the day of his b.day such another lovely touch.  Weather was hit or miss but due to the time of year but we used the shuttle bus to take us to the old town & new town (The Strip), this was a great service only issue was limited space on shuttle not sure if sure if time of year but only did few afternoon collections & on limited numbers you could end up walking.  If your quite fit not a problem. We walked back from old town and it took us an hour.  Everywhere is very clean. The walk down to the beach was lovely & we stopped off at the beachfront cafe for breakfast one morning can’t recommend it enough was stunning view & very relaxing. Lovely Beach. I would recommend the scrambled eggs (they looked so yummy,) we had full English which was horrible.  Frankfurter sausages, cheese herb topping on the tomato which tasted awful, the whole breakfast tasted weird. The evening entertainment we only caught one evening but was the best entertainment we have seen while on holiday.  Amazing girl singing with a keyboard player, she had the most amazing voice & covered a large range of songs. The hotel does some gorgeous cocktails slightly more expensive than out of the resort but only by 1 – 2 euros. We had enjoyed 1 or 2 looking out at the beautiful view from reception.We did not eat at the hotel so I am unable to comment but we the Pizza/Pasta restaurant called Portobello opposite the resort was really lovely very welcoming & amazing food and also did takeaway. Great price too. We ate there, was very popular, great atmosphere.  I took away a doggie bag as could not manage all mine.  Also the restaurant down the road from the resort was also amazing and well-priced. We tried the local dish Cataplana cannot recommend this enough was amazing.  Staffs were very friendly & even recommend another restaurant to eat in, in the old town gave us a business card & who to ask for sadly we did not get chance as it was our last night. We did not use the leisure facilities as we thought paying to use indoor pool out of season was very expensive plus had to buy a swim hat !   Overall we had a lovely few days & I would like to think we will go back soon"
Apr 2017,40,Nice family hotel,"This 5 star hotel falls down in the self catered apartments, that are really due for a bit of a spruce up to keep with the 5 star rating.There was only 1 outdoor heated pool so at Easter time this became a bit too overcrowded with kids. The unheated pools were OK for a dip if you were brave enough!Great beach location with a couple of places to eat within walking distance ( a pizza place and a traditional Portuguese place - both really nice!)"
Apr 2017,40,Pleasant stay,When arrived I was given an outside one bedroom apartment which I found to have a very musty smell which I reported to reception on the 2nd day. I was offered another apartment but felt there wouldn't be much difference as it was only a few doors down. I was offered a room in the hotel when one became available on the Sunday. I took the room in the hotel and was very glad I did so. Such a difference hotel rooms are lovely. Made such a difference to my overall experience of the holiday. Thank you to Paula the Manager at reception.
Apr 2017,50,Best holiday I've ever been on!,"I can safely say this is the best holiday we have ever been on! The hotel is fantastic, the staff are extremely helpful, the rooms are cleaned to an excellent standard, the location is sport on. We didn't stay all inclusive so I can't really comment on the food but what we did have was amazing. The cocktails are great! There is a shop a very short walk from the hotel and two lovely restaurants one across the road which we loved and another just next door - the food there was lovely too. The hotel puts on a free bus to the old and new town which we found to be a really nice day out. If you dont get the bus back it's about 8 euros in a taxi.The beach which the hotel is located on is everything you want from a beach - it's clean, lovely sand, not too many stones and the water was lovely with a few waves which the kids loved! There's a few snack bars over looking the beach, the views are amazing! Theres another shop which sells things from bucket and spades to ice creams.If I had to say anything negative at all it would be some of the shops/restaurants are a bit pricey but this was my first time in Portugal and maybe I should had found that out before coming! My children and I did not want our holiday to end and will be coming back here in the very near future. Just before I finish I read some of the reviews on trip advisor for this hotel before coming out and all I can say is ignore any negative comments!!!"
Apr 2017,50,Beauty,The place was so inviting and lovely atomosphere.  Room service was excellent.  Their restaurant was one of a kind.  Food was delicious.  The staff went out of their way to look after our needs. There were friendly staff.  The place was always clean and accommodating.
Apr 2017,40,Position and food,We stayed in this hotel with our 8 year old grandson on a half board basis for one week.The hotel is not near any other shops or cafes so there is nowhere to even  have  a stroll to after dinner.  Reception area and staff very friendly and efficient.We had an apartment which was well stocked and thoroughly cleaned every day   Beds very comfortable.Pool areas very good. The problem we had was with the main dining restaurant.  It was woefully small for the number of diners every morning for breakfast and for our main meal at night. This resulted in queues every morning and evening. One evening we waited 25 minutes to be seated. The queue stretched to the top of the stairs at one stage! On average we spent 15 minutes queueing. They also seated parties of 2 and 4 before groups of 3 or 5 whether you were next in the queue or not!This did not make for happy diners!There was not a wide variety of food for a 5 star hotel and very little suitable for children. Great if you were vegetarian though. We will not be returning to this hotel. It just did not suit our needs.
Apr 2017,40,Wonderful Family Holiday,"The hotel is wonderful.  Location is perfect, rooms are a good size and overall maintained to a very high standard.  Unfortunately the apartment had a raw sewage smell that was tolerable, but not nice.  The only other negative is that only one pool is heated. Therefore everyone used this pool and it was overcrowded.  It would be ideal if the other pools could be heated.  There are plenty of sun beds and the staff are very helpful.  I would definitely return to this hotel."
Apr 2017,40,Good hotel - nice setting,"Nice hotell and settings with lost to do and big variety or testurants and bars.  The rooms could do with a bit of maintance, but very clean and comfortable.  The WIFI needs to be updateded and availabel outside as well - but it was OK"
Apr 2017,50,An astonishing surprise!!!,"Everything in this hotel surprised me, the friendliness and availability of all the staff, the accommodations, the services, the pools, the restaurants ... the food, especially the rich and exquisite breakfast. Access to the beach is easy, but the saltwater pool with bar is also a great option. I strongly recommend ... or obligatorily."
Apr 2017,30,Close but no cigar,"Nice clean place, staff very friendly. Room was nice and spacious. the beds were harder than the tiled floor so didn't sleep well for the whole week. We needed late check out which cost us an extra €72.50 which quite frankly is obscene The food is very average  we were half board and breakfast was the best meal of the day, you can use your 2nd meal of the day on either lunch or dinner. Lunch generally was BBQ and I was served raw pork one occasion dinner was ok lots of variety but none of it was plain so even my kids who one isn't fussy struggled to find anything they would eat so spent the week mostly eating bread rolls and pasta with no sauce! Plus there's only one restaurant you can use if you're half board so the ques for the buffet are ridiculous at times Pool side was nice but only one was heated and therefore chaotic as all the other pools were empty.The bars were nice but ludicrously expensive €4 for a bottle of water was a joke!The kids club we didn't use but they get a bouncy castle out one day and right by it had archery for the kids with no barriers to stop people walking in front of the target which is just plain dangerous. The beach was lovely and the view from atlantico restaurant were very pleasant. On the whole the holiday was good but not worth the star rating it has! I'd say it's a good 3 star! But open the other restaurants up to half board lower the prices of drinks a bit and tighten up safety for kids activities put some beds that aren't rock hard and would be really good!"
Apr 2017,50,returning happy customer.,"large restaurant excellent breakfast superb beach restaurant good inside restaurant could do with more variety maybe chicken,If one who does not want burgers.Otherwise keep up the good work,Also had a great suprise on my birthday with your great cake"
Apr 2017,40,Good hotel,"Hotel very clean, helpful staff, large rooms, efficient check in and out service..Room service efficient .  Great choices for breakfast. Swimming pool was rather small for size of hotel (although there were three of them). Set on public beach with some sunbeds that have to be paid for depending on which way the wind is blowing! could get charged 15 or 10 euros for 2 and you may or may not get an umbrella thrown in! you don't get a receipt. Hotel offers a free shuttle bus into Alburfeira but only takes 27 passengers. good local bus service into Faro/Vilamoura etc. but again watch how much you get charged and how much change you are given - price will be on the tickets. The hop on hop off sight seeing bus is better value if you buy for a Saturday as you are able to use it again on Sunday at no extra cost. Good restaurants Martins/Portebello just outside the gates. Half hour walk takes you into Olho L'Agua,( turn right outside hotel) could walk into Alburfeira in about 40 mins. Don't take the shuttle bus way, if you turn left out of the hotel keep walking to the roundabout and go straight across and follow the road straight through, takes you into Alburfeira. Beautiful beaches but strong currents."
Apr 2017,40,Could be better!,The appartment was large enough. Before C/I could be fresher cleaned. The AC in the space was a litle bit noisy. The staff was in generally nice and helpfull. It was a good experience but you can improve some small details. Thank you! See you next time...
Apr 2017,40,A nice taste of summer,We was at Algarve for the first time.And choosed this hotel via an agent.Nice and clean hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Great beds. But airconditioning was not impressive. Så we rather had the balconydoor open at night.OK in April but maybe not so good in the summer? Breakfast ok but we was missing a lot more vegetables. A lot of fruit and cakes though.We had a car so no problem getting around. Hotell also have a free bustransfer to Albufeira centro.Good football-channels on tv :)
Apr 2017,50,A Great week in Albufeira,"Stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment for a week and the place and surroundings are stunning. One of the pools was opposite our apartment so used this daily which was great for my 11 year old son.The hotel provides a mini bus service to the New and also Old town in Albufeira this we used daily to go for lunch in the old town, the service was always on time and only once did we fail to get on the bus as it was full.We ate in the hotel on a number of occasions the food was good and the price was reasonable.And most impotently I will return it was that good."
Apr 2017,30,Very nice sea view room - great locally run fish restaurant at the beach,"We had a lovely sea view room with a nice Terrasse overlooking the beautiful bay.We had booked bed and breakfast - which was great as we could walk over to the low key local fish restaurant at the beach every evening. (We liked the fresh fish, amazing views and atmosphere there so much, we did not even try the restaurants of the hotel - so can not comment on food quality there)Breakfast was fine though. We did not like the Maschine coffee (at all), so they gave us alternatives filter coffee which was better.Nice bread, nice fruit, not extensive but everything was there and nice.We were usually there before 9 am - once we walked by at 10:00 and there was a long line waiting to get in. All in all a nice experience - and for what we payed absolutely acceptable value for money.Major points: great location and viewsNice staffEverything worksWe came in off season - I would think it gets crazy busy in high season.We booked it for the sea view rooms and heated pool - the heated pool was nice and warm but so small (maybe 7-8m in diameter) it got super crowded. We called it the ""pipi"" pool and showered our daughter very thoroughly after use....;-DIt was still perfect - she loved itThe beach in front of the hotel is very beautiful...Drinks and ice cream at the bar and pool are overpriced. (Did not bother us as we rarely used it...)The kids club looked ok - our daughter used it twice for 50 minutes as they had a bouncy castle she wanted to use - otherwise she preferred the pool.All in all it was ok - compared to the hotels we tried on Canary Islands this one had much nicer views  and bigger rooms but facilities in the other hotels were much better...I was debating the average rating as it just does not feel at all like a five star.... and the advertised heated pool is very very small....I know country standards vary....If expectations are right it's certainly a very nice place...The apartments and parking lot rooms do not have any views...There were many kids around when we were there ...a plus for us but maybe not everyone felt that way..."
Apr 2017,30,A clean hotel in a good location.,"A clean hotel in a good location with excellent seaviews. There is plenty of space around the hotel and the spa was excellent but it was a shame that you had to pay extra to use this facility. The food at breakfast was good but there were long queues to enter the breakfast restaurant and,  even though it was buffet style, it would be less chaotic if staff brought pots of coffee or tea to the table."
Apr 2017,40,Family holiday,We enjoyed our 7 night stay. Food was a little over-priced with very few vegetarian options. My family and I have some dietary requirements which we informed the hotel of before our trip and during our trip. We were told they would cater for us but they did not make much effort to do so. But we found other places nearby to have dinners so location of hotel is very good. Overall it was a lovely stay and we would consider coming back.
Apr 2017,50,"Fantastic hotel, Excellent Staff","Recently we stayed in this hotel. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. All the Staff were helpful, polite and friendly. The room  was very clean, big and overlooking the pool. One of the outdoor pools was heated and my kids had an extended session of swimming. I have got a son with special needs and he had a magical holiday in Algarve mainly for the hotel- can not thank the Staff enough! The beach is next to the hotel which was very handy. My wife used the spa for a relaxing massage and she was extremely happy with the cleanliness, friendliness and the skill of the masseuse Ricardo."
Apr 2017,50,Lovely Holiday,Had a thoroughly lovely stay at this hotel and have been recommending it to friends since my return.  Definitely 5 star!  Lovely sea view room with enormous bed. Could not wait for breakfast each day the selection was so varied.
Apr 2017,50,Family holiday,Hotel is amazing and so is the location. It has amazing pools and the beach is on location. Only downside is food was not amazing.. halal food was very difficult to find. But overall an amazing place.. defo visit
Apr 2017,40,We have stayed with pleasure in your hotel.,"May be in the evening beter music, sometimes it was too loud of not good at all. The rooms can be a little bit more of this time, thee are looking old. Also in the rooms a Coocker for making tea of coffee."
Apr 2017,40,Mrs mcdonough ,"Just got back from this hotel in Portugal we went for 10 nights b&b,I have to say this hotel was exceptional clean, most of staff helpful & friendly. BUT the pool was frezzzzzing & I mean frezzzzing, one couple said there child lips turned blue which I quite believe.The hotel advertised they had spa & indoor pool & library which they did NOT HAVE!!!!!!!!!!! The entertainment was a crappy singer, then nothing for 4 nights then a parrot show which lasted all of half hour, all thought the hotel was clean & bedroom were nice WE WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS HOTEL"
Apr 2017,50,"A classic, grand hotel, right on the seafront, with a stunning beach a stones throw away","For the price we paid we went with no expectations, and were very pleasantly surprised.  To begin our holiday we were met with smiling staff, who were eager to help in a kind, polite, professional way, they were all very helpful and knowledgeable. The room was sea view junior suite, was huge, our 7 year old had his own bathroom, double bed and balcony, fridge and TV! It is very clean, and cleaned every day, the bathroom was big, and lovely hot shower, with clean fluffy towels and bathrobes.You can only the hear the ocean at night, no cars, doors banging or people, it is very relaxing and peaceful. The pools were just right, not huge, but plenty of sunbeds and room with a nice poolside bar, we went in the beginning of April and you can swim in the pool (heated) or sea with not too much of a chill. We went half board, breakfast was plentiful, dinner was varied and local, and very well presented and the waiters are very helpful, some nights we had to queue so get to dinner early, don't expect the usual chicken nuggets and chips for buffet tea, fussy kids will be eating a lot of pasta! There is a great cafe/bar on the way to the beach which is great for lunches.  The beach is clean, and large enough for everyone, and beautiful.Bus to town was OK, but again plan ahead, get there early, as only a 27 seater, taxis are only 6 or 7 euros to old town though. New town is typical brits abroad, football, tv, beer, Irish pubs and cheap souvenir shops, old town was a little better, a few clubs and nightlife around in the evening but with little 'un to look after I didn't get to explore the nightlife.Recommend the little yellow train to get from old/new town etc. very cheap and a good ride for the kids. Overall very happy, relaxing, great experience with the hotel, there isn't a great deal to do outside the area, but the hotel have entertainment every night, kids club, pools, beaches and tennis etc. so all good.Would recommend for young families, who want to get away on a budget."
Apr 2017,50,Very nice,For a 7 day bed and breakfast holiday at this hotel was excellent along with fantastic weather. Our room had the view of the beach and garden. Can not fault the champagne breakfast and the hotel itself was just grand. What I would like to see improvement on in the future is the day and especially the evening/night entertainment. The only other minor thing that seem to be missing was that there was no tea and coffee facility provided in the rooms.
Apr 2017,30,Not 5 star rating,There are 27 seats you have to fight for for a free transfer they offer in to main town.Had waited half an hour on 2 occasions and not got on. Had to pay for a taxi. If you are a vegetarian forget this hotel.They are interested in taking money off you instead of entertaining you.
Apr 2017,50,"It's got everything you could dream of, for a very good price","This place is like a dream, it's got everything, beach, spa, lots of restaurants, swimming pools and sun loungers, great activities for all ages (organised activities from 2 to 99 if I recall right) - we did archery and pilates as well as saw a parrot show, all inclusive. This was our second visit and I cannot wait to go back. All the staff are really friendly and treat you like a star and it costs much less than a very average hotel room in the UK."
Apr 2017,50,"Clean, friendly and comfortable","My family and I (wife + 2 kids, 5 & 8) stayed here from 3rd to 7th April.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  I found the staff to be very friendly, always polite and very accomodating and helpful.  The hotel is clean and comfortable.  On arrival there was an issue with the a/c in our room which was promptly resolved with the offer to change rooms and a bottle of complimentary wine and some fruit (for the kids) to say sorry.  Food was great and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  And the wifi works without any issues which was a very welcome suprise.  It can be a bit expensive with a room service pizza costing é14 and i think there is an additional charge on top.  You can get a pizza from just outside the gates (at a pizza place) for é6.  That said i would not hesitate to recommed this place.  The beach is a card swipe away and pools are very relaxing."
Apr 2017,30,Good hotel with good facilities marred by bad room and delay in fixing issues,"It was a really good break for us. The hotel facilities are good for families and the staff are very helpful. The reason for the three star rating was the issues we had with the room - electrical issues in the bed room, extractor fan in the bathroom not working and the toilet flush leaking. There were some walls in the room that had the wall paper missing in places.We have been here for three years running but I am not sure I will be returning given the status of the apartment that I was in."
Apr 2017,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa,"Good Location, Friendly staff, Good service,  Easy to commute to town center and restaurants. Hotel is very big and has private access to the beach. It is very good for family stay as they do different shows for children."
Apr 2017,50,Happy holiday in Santa Eulalia,Lovely hotel staff friendly and easy access to various location on my trip swam with dolphins at zoomarine which was a great experience and I would stay hear again as hotel is very close to the beach 😃
Apr 2017,40,Very nice Location!,We have spent a beautiful holiday. Exzellent food and good suites. Perfect Location near to a wonderful beach.The next town Albufeira is okay for one time visit. But almost in british hands and good restaurants you will mostly not find there.
Apr 2017,40,Grand Real Resort Hotel,"We had a lovely family holiday.  The room needed a little updating but clean.  Hotel is in a lovely position with spectacular views.  Staff were very helpful and efficient.  The only downside for us was the pool area and sunbeds, it was taking me back to my childhood when you get up at crack of dawn to put your towel on sunbeds.  We highly recommend hotel great value for money and will be going back."
Apr 2017,40,A great quality family holiday,"During a week in early April the weather was great. The hotel great quality and relaxing for a family with children with access to several pools and the beach. Due to the time of year there was a bit of routine maintenance going on but we were never interrupted by builders or noise and there were alternative pools etc.The buffet dinner and breakfast are excellent but next time I wouldn't go full board as the lunches are not as great and there's no drinks or ice cream for the children through the day.The apartment are excellent we had two separate bedrooms for ourselves and the children as well as living area with kitchen, lounge and balcony. There were two bathrooms too.Staff are great, very helpful always attentive.When we last visited during August there was more choice for children at the evening buffet. The only minor nag would be that in April our children were choosing what they wanted from a largely adult selection. It's a personal thing but they aren't so keen on fish dishes etc at their age."
Apr 2017,50,Great hotel for families,Hotel has good infrastructure and layout that families could spend entire trip within the property. Has pools in every section of hotel helping in taking swim close by though believe only one pool in heated.Location is good with bus to Faro and Albufeira right at exit gates. Good service and helping staff with bus itinerary and bookings available from front decks.Only pique had was that room cleaning staff changed towels every day though notice in bathroom said that would be changed only if on floor. Just my environment friendly side kicking in here.
Apr 2017,50,Spring Break,We stayed in a 1 bed apartment on a self catering basis. The whole experience exceeded our expectations. 5 star service and 5 star facilities. I am looking forward to returning soon and would highly recommend this resort to others.
Apr 2017,50,"Brilliant Hotel, fabulous break.","My sis in law and myself stayed at the Grande Real for a week in early April.  Magnificent hotel, in a stunning setting.  Staff were friendly and attentive, nothing was too much for them. Food was excellent, with a wonderful variety. Rooms were beautiful and spotless. The sea views from the hotel were breathtaking.  The whole week at the hotel was just wonderful, loved every minute of it.  Will definitely return. Would recommend it to all ages."
Apr 2017,50,Love this place!,"Love this place.  Ticks all the boxes for our family.  Have booked already for next year.  Beach is stunning and very exclusive.  Apartments are huge and immaculate.  Staff are extremely helpful, friendly and professional.  Kids club is safe and very friendly.  Pools are great and always lots of available sunbeds.  We love the Atlantico bar for our meals."
Apr 2017,50,Family holiday ,"Great family holiday. Hotel large with several pools, kids activities, gym, free exercise classes and great spa if you fancy some pampering. We are staying in an apartment, which is great for us and the children (plenty of room for 10 and 12). Excellent breakfast - huge variety of food catering for all tastes. Hotel location is perfect - beautiful beach and short walk (10 mins) to local restaurants (most of which offer great value tourist menus for €12- 13 pp). Staff friendly & helpful. Would come back."
Apr 2017,50,Easter break,Stayed in a 2-bed apartment on self catering basis over Easter with our young children. We were very impressed with the resort and plan to return in the summer. Would recommend half board as an option for our next stay.
Apr 2017,50,Location Location Location,"This is a beautifully located, family friendly luxury hotel at a very reasonable price. It has spas, champagne cocktails and fine dining for indulgence-seekers alongside snacks and a very good kids menu for families on a budget. There are beautiful sunsets from the terrace, a safe, sandy beach just down the rocky steps, play area, activities, kids club, entertainment..you really can dip in and out as you wish. All immaculately clean and very, very friendly - highly recommended."
Apr 2017,50,Great Vacation,"Stayed in a 2 bedroomed appartment as family also joined us.On arrival a welcome greeting and explanation of all available services, then taken along with luggage by a golf cart to our accommodation, everything explained we then unpacked.Great spacious and clean appartement.Swimming pools great, clean and plenty of space around to relax in peace."
Apr 2017,40,Best 5 nights,We are so happy.....would like to recommend to all...definition we will be back....thank you to you all...so many things to do.....beautiful atmosfere...+ 26 on start of April  wow www ...so close to beach....got sting on my foot by bee.....good memories
Apr 2017,40,Comfort,"Lovely resort, would rate it a 4* not a 5. A lot of young children running around, area and pool needed for adults. Sun beds supplied on beach would have been nice. Rooms lovely but slightly dated, food lovely but very over priced. Can't fault service of staff very attentive and helpful"
Apr 2017,50,Algarve Oasis,Excellent resort hotel with first rate facilities on one of the loveliest beaches I've been to. Well equipped and spotlessly clean apartments. Children enjoyed the pool. If I were being really picky I would recommend an apartment on the top floor to avoid noise from tiled floors and a word of warning about the rock hard beds. Otherwise fantastic resort.
Apr 2017,50,Recommend,"Good 5 star hotel, good location, good facilities, great beach, food/ drink expensive in the hotel but plenty of good restaurants and bars within walking distance and beachside,would stay again and recommend."
Apr 2017,30,Not 5 star standard,"Myself & my husband had a week half board at this hotel resort. We had decided to choose this hotel for our recent break in Portugal because it offered half board, swimming pools outside & one indoor pool, plus near the beach. The pools were shallow only suitable to use as a plunge pool . Only one of the pools open was heated which meant it was constently busy, with some parents not even putting swimming nappies on younger children. There were plenty of lounges, but umbrellas were in short supply or broken. The beach was a stroll through the resort's grounds and was very nice and clean. The resort did supply pool/beach towels daily. Our room overlooked the car park but was clean , had a small balcony with table & chairs. The room was a bit small and an odd shape because of the curve of the building. This meant one end of the room was wider than the other end. The bed was not a double bed but actually two beds pushed together. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were buffet. It was reasonable quality but if you wanted a coffee at lunch or dinner it was extra. Wine could be bought by the glass or bottle. When a bottle of wine was purchased your room number was put on it for use at an other time. There was a complimentary bus to & from Alberferia. The hotel evening entertainment was not great & took place in a section of reception. It lacked atmosphere & the seating was a bit worn & uncomfortable. Wifi was free and worked well. The indoor pool was in the spa and costs 20 Euro per hour. It is heated sea water but hardly ever used. The resort offered Aqua fit & palates classes which were held in the spa. The gym in the spa area was available to guests. There were also spa treatments on offer for guests with a discount when staying at the resort. Staff were friendly, and helpful."
Apr 2017,50,Spring time bliss!,"A stunning resort with outstanding service, breathtaking views and the perfect place to make memories.The apartments are super roomy and very well equipped. No area is crammed and the beach is just heavenly!"
Apr 2017,50,Good location...,"We stayed here for a week at the end of March, into April 2017. We stayed in E Block overlooking one of the pool areas on a self catering basis. The patio area was south facing allowing us to sit outside to enjoy the good weather. At this time of year it can be a bit cool but warms up nicely during the day.I can’t say there’s anything significant to find fault with. The rooms are perhaps a bit whacky with the eccentric, bold colourful decor but the one bedroom apartment was well furnished, clean and comfortable. There were plenty of plates, kitchen utensils and so on. The beds were comfortable and the housekeeper kept the place to a good standard. The air-conditioning wasn’t really necessary but it kept doing its own thing, despite being switched off. It was a bit noisy but no worse than many other places. As we were self catering, we didn’t use the main hotel restaurants. The public areas are very pleasant and well cared for. The staff we encountered were very pleasant and helpful. The beach was beautiful. This too was roughly south facing with pretty flowers on the fragile backdrop of limestone cliffs. There are bits of maintenance going on and we accept, indeed, expect that to happen. Whilst we were there, they were treating the wooden decking areas around the pools. We took advice from TripAdvisor reviews to find supermarkets and the “strip” which were (assuming reasonable mobility) within reasonable walking distances. I don’t do reviews of restaurants but we were tempted to try the fish and chips at “Lara’s Plaice.”  Well worth a visit and would get 5*s but in sharp contrast was La Bodega. Foi terrível and possibly a contender for our poorest dining experience… ever!The hotel has a mini-bus shuttle going to the old town, passing the “strip” part of new town. What a great service. Each Thursday afternoon there is a guided tour of the old town. We’ve been before but it’s nice having a few new things pointed out that you may otherwise miss. Would we go back? Definitely, what a good location..."
Apr 2017,40,nice place to stay!,"very nice hotel, perfect location, food.. only for adults, no food selection for children, night entertainment bit disappointed, SPA too expensive and indoor pool should be free of charge, but I would recommend this hotel"
Apr 2017,50,Grande Real Top Hotel !,"My wife and I recently had a 7 night stay here on a self catering basis.I have never met such happy and helpful staff, nothing was too much trouble and we were always greeted with courtesy and a smile.The hotel facilities are excellent and the beach front position is perfect.The standard of cleanliness both in the hotel itself and in the apartments is exceptional and a credit to the cleaning staff.We will certainly be making a return visit to this lovely hotel."
Apr 2017,40,Great Hotel,"We stayed for a week in March 17 with our two children 4 months and 17 months, the hotel, staff and food are great. the only issues we had where the children's club, room quality and the spa facilities:-children's club do not cater fro children under 3 despite what your tour operator might sayRoom quality is dated and carpets stained, fridges moved from suites and drainage is not great from the shower, and beware that suites with a garden view sometimes look over the carpark and are noisy in the morning with cars and buses leaving. Spa is very expensive and not worth the money."
Apr 2017,50,Holidays,My wife and I had five great days here could not find fault anywhere staff were very pleasant throughout.great location and free shuttle bus to old town.would highly recommend.pool areas very clean and plenty of loungers and great to have beach just steps away .
Apr 2017,40,Enjoyable stay,"we stayed on one of the apartment studios, which was very nice and had all amenities, but a small balcony holding  table and 2 chairs. The view was of the complex, which wasn't unpleasant. However the views from the hotel restaurant and bars are amazing. The terraces in the hotel are very comfortable and  have unobstructed views. We stayed in apartment 580. When we booked in we were told we'd be brought there by hotel buggy, which alarmed me a little. It wasn't too bad apart from the steps up to our room. In the evening coming back from the hotel, it was a little too dark in places. Thought the price in the restaurant was expensive, so ate out most nights at 1/2 the price, but really they were the only gripes."
Apr 2017,50,Grande Real Santa Eutalia Hotel,"Everything about the hotel worked very well for our stay and intend returning later in the year or same time next year - the hotel, staff and service ticked all the boxes during our one week stay and we look forward to returning."
Apr 2017,50,Real Brilliant!,"Nothing was too much in every aspect of stay. enjoyed every minute, Staff, cheerful, helpful, professional and polite, must be the envy of other hotels in Algarve, Recommend to anyone, of any age, something for everyone."
Apr 2017,50,A gem on the coast.,We visited this hotel for a 7 night stay. We hadn't been to portugal before but now having been we will definitely return both to portugal and the hotel. The staff were polite and seemed happy in their jobs. All gelled together as a real team.The services in the hotel were so well organised we really couldn't fault it. The food is very good quality and there's always plenty of choice. The hotel and pool area are spotless. The only minor criticism is the heated pool is a little on the small size and we think it would be beneficial to heat the other pool as this was abandoned due to it being freezing. We visited the Atlantico bar and would recommend the food. All superb quality and very reasonably priced. Overall excellent hotel in beautiful surroundings.
Apr 2017,50,Fantastic place,"Lovely hotel, amazing view, lovely staff,rooms ,spa very clean,staff very helpful to give you directions to find places,we loved it! Can't wait to go back ! The bars in there were really welcoming and staff were very friendly live music was also really enjoyable!"
Apr 2017,50,Great holiday,An excellent relaxing holiday with plenty of your options and activities of you want to see more of the Algarve and surrounding areas. Very friendly staff and atmosphere; I was travelling alone. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
Apr 2017,40,Short break,A vey good hotel for a short break. The free transport to Albufeira was especially appreciated. The staff were very attentive and obliging. The situation was very pleasant. It all made for a relaxing stay
Apr 2017,50,Excellent,"The reception was really helpful , especially a guy who works in there , his neme is joy ( something like that) service absolutely brilliant  , rooms are really clean , there are  2  different pools  , in total ( excellent )"
Apr 2017,50,Perfect ,"We checked in at 11.30 am and were took to our room straight away, I had resigned myself to waiting till at least 3 for the keys so that was a great start.  We had a one bedroom apartment that was huge and extremely clean, with large fluffy white towels and bath robes, fully functional kitchen (that we never used) with all cooking utensils that you could possibly need.  We never ate in the hotel so can't comment on the food, a decent bottle of wine sitting in the bar overlooking the beach was 20 euros, I have seen some complaints about the prices but the view is worth the extra cost in my opinion.  There is a shuttle bus that runs into the strip and the Old Town, but if you prefer to walk it's takes 15 minutes to walk to the Strip, mostly uphill and 1 hour to walk to the Old Town.  The hotel has its own stretch of beach that is just stunning, you go out the back door and down some steps to reach it, there are two beach bars, one attached to the hotel that is excellent value and has a good choice for breakfast (breakfast in the hotel is 12.50 euros) or you can walk along the beach to another bar/restaurant with fabulous views and again excellent food, two of us could not finish the Tuna salad meant for one! Would love to go back to this hotel but flights from Glasgow and Edinburgh have ridiculous times.  If you have booked this hotel you should love it, there really isn't anything to complain about."
Apr 2017,50,Emotional ,"First family holiday with my 2 boys aged 4momths and 17months and partner, the hotel food was excellent , the boys loved the pools....the staff were so friendly and the manager met our needs of our babies as we needed a jug and sterilizer plus upgraded our room, she made the holiday for us it isnt easy with babies,  thanks so much it was the best holiday by far as the manager made our family love every minute, booked again for september for 2 weeks.  The views are spectacular , you stop for breathe and its like your in paradise."
Apr 2017,50,Albafeira Holiday,"First class holiday accommodation and resort , beautiful views, kind and helpful staff , plenty of restaurants in the resort and also Spa and gymnasium facilities. Short taxi ride to Old and New town of Albafeira. Brilliant holiday would recommend."
Apr 2017,50,Grande real santa eulalia march sun,"Lovely hotel in a great location. 15 minute walk to bars and restaurants not to lively but enough. 7 euros to old town in taxi for good food eating places and about 6 euros to the strip for a more lively nnight out. Hotel on a well kept clean beach and we had a room over looking so the sound of the sea aa bonus. Lovely hotel bar overlooking this with good selection of snacks reasonably priced. Hotel  vclean and staff a credit to this establishment. We celebrated our wedding anniversary and husbands birthday here. Pleasantly surprised to have room service delivery a lovely trolley with treats. It really made us feel special and such a thoughtful gesture. Breakfast was good one slight negative would be at peak time had to wait for staff to replemish certain items. Staff worked hard but maybe a coulple more staff would sort this out. We went out most evenings to eat so cannot comment on evening meals or entertainment. This is a hotel for a relaxing holiday no loud music blurring out all day, no reps noting you to join in. We enjoyed this hotel and would return."
Apr 2017,50,Amazing,"Hotel was amazing, reception team were so nice and helpful every day. Monica in the spa was so friendly and I had the best facial. Breakfast everyday was delicious so many choices to choose from. Overall an unforgettable stay in a beautiful hotel. Thank you."
Apr 2017,50,Baby moon holiday :),Amazing place and very family friendly.Staff were fabulous and treated our 19 month daughter as a equal valued guest. Something we've not seen in any other hotels before.Service was incredible and really friendly staff.Would recommend and hope to return
Apr 2017,40,Hotel with nice view,"We stayed for 13 nights, excellent room location with balcony and  sea front.For a five star hotel rooms need to be renovated, specially the carpets need to be replaced. I don'tthink carpets are hygienic...ceramic tiles or hard wood floors are more appreciated. Great hotel!!Location is great. The front desk staff were very professional and friendly."
Apr 2017,50,Lovely Hotel,"Just stayed for 1 week,all areas were not open as some refurbishment was taking place,but this did not affect anyone.Our stay was for chilling and  relaxing.The hotel is really nice and comfy and all the staff are friendly and polite. Will be coming again. Great Week"
Apr 2017,40,Spring Stay,"My Partner I booked to stay here end of March for a 3 night break, the hotel is really nice, great location, right on the beach, close to the town, we rented a car, which I think is a must to see the area and get to from Faro. Staff are really friendly, we only ate there for breakfast which is really good, huge variety of fresh food..and bubbles if you have want a glass early. The down sides, the weather wasn't that great our first day, the only indoor pool is considered a therapy pool as it's sea water!, to use it is 20 euros per person for an hour!! Which we, and having spoken to other guests thought was daft and didn't use, so it's always empty. The outdoor pools when the weather is nice are way too small, two circular pools to waist level that would feel crowded with 10 people in each. Finally the room servicing is really late, we went out early and left a please clean our room sign on the door, when we got back at 3.30 the room wasn't done, when we called reception they informed us that they have until 5pm to do them, which is a bit late in the day."
Apr 2017,50,Fantastic hotel,Really nice hotel very clean good staff would definitely stay again only fault I could make was no coffee making facilities in room but that is be picky food was excellent and we had asea view room that was superb over the beach
Apr 2017,50,"wonderful location, breakfast was very good ,very clean rooms. fabulous","Location was great, sea views and sound of the waves worth paying extra for, breakfast was very good.spa prices a bit high but usually have discounted treatments. To eat all meals at hotel would work out expensive.  Old Town had a lovely Japanese that had excellent time food at a good price . Lots of burger bars and snack bars around. Would recommend end of march early April  for quieter  and cheaper warm.holiday."
Apr 2017,30,not a 5 * hotel,"The service at the bar is insufficient, the Spa is too expensive and far too short an hour, the two pools are too small, from 18:00 there is to eat no snacks unfortunately. overall not as 5 * hotel to call."
Apr 2017,50,Another lovely stay,"Stayed here a year or so ago with family, this time with husband and sister in law, hotel lived up to my reports to them, very comfortable hotel, breakfasts good, buffet restaurant also good. Rooms very clean. Good service by household staff. Pools clean, staff very helpful and friendly."
Apr 2017,50,Excellent Hotel,"A warm welcome at reception, informative and efficient. The gentlemen who took us to our room waited until we could watch him open the curtains to show the most beautiful view of the beach. A ""wow"" moment for my wife and I. The hotel is comfortable, very clean, the staff are friendly and helpful and create a very relaxed ambience. We will return."
Apr 2017,30,mixed bag,"D'ont stay half board.  Restaurant hectic, long queues for food.  People tripping over each other.  Not at all relaxing.  What food there was, was tasty enough but was not a lot to choose from.  If you wish to take your half board option at lunch time it was another buffet. Worse again, the food was all gone a hour before lunch was due to finish.  Lesson - do not take half board.  There are good restaurants just outside the complex. P.S. if you have any dietary needs like gluten free definitely do not bother. You might as well say you are from Mars."
Apr 2017,50,Smart hotel,Enjoyable early season 5 day break.  Friendly and well trained staff. Good location with a nice 45 min walk into Albufeira old town or 20 min to the strip.   Worth requesting a sea view room. Good value 5* break.
Apr 2017,40,Great location on the beach,"Returned to Grande Real for 8th visit. Love the position of the hotel with proximity of beach being perfect.  Did find that hotel was a little tired and rooms need refurbished to make it 5 star standard. The staff at the hotel are excellent and everything is kept so clean and sparkling. Nice to see that there is now some entertainment in the evenings  as the mixed weather during our stay meant being more hotel based than usual. Didnt use the spa on this visit as they did  not have the  good offers for treatments as on previous visits and therefore costs too high for us this time, even with discount voucher offered.Will definitely return in the future but hope some refurbishments will take place to keep the hotel up to the 5 star standard."
Apr 2017,50,Free upgrade,4th visit and was given a suite on the top floor made the 4 night stay so memorable thank you very much John & carole UK the breakfast buffet is the best ever and staff are so polite and friendly and very efficient
Apr 2017,40,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa - holiday March 2017,"The ambience is very nice and a relaxing experience during our stay.  The reception is very helpful on excursions suggestions and on providing information.   Location is very good as its near the beach, bus stop and town."
Apr 2017,40,Short break,Great location.very relaxing.will come again.the views are outstanding.take the shuttle in to town.its only 8 Euros taxi back.also make sure u visit the caves.they are spectacular.the spa in the hotel is good.facial was good value.
Mar 2017,50,Absolutely an awesome place to stay. Staff are fantastic and friendly creating a really relaxed atmosphere.,They really make you feel welcomed. I'm also impressed by their skills in speaking so many different languages. The hotel is located on a beautiful stretch of beach and there are ample places to eat at without leaving the complex. Every need is catered for.
Mar 2017,50,Beautiful resort on a beautiful Bay,"We were in this year for the tenth time here. That says it all, right?In recent years, we have made many trips to the Algarve and it looked at other hotels. Taking into account the price-performance ratio and the very nice, direct location on the Atlantic coast, there is no alternative for us. For the House also speaks, that we know many employees from the first year."
Mar 2017,40,Great location on the beach,"Great seaview from the rooms, and a lovely beach to walk on. Very clean and nice staff.  It was very peaceful though it was off season so that probably helped! A little dated perhaps but well kept and I particularly liked being able to access the beach so easily. There is a nice beachside bar too. There is a regular bus to take you to Albuferia if you happen to want to go there but there are some adequate restaurants nearby.  The spa is nice, with pleasant staff, thank you Sandra!"
Mar 2017,50,Good location,"Always stay in 5* hotels and with the low price I was very sceptical, but there was no need to have been as its a lovely hotel. My only criticism was no tea or coffee facilities in the room. The staff were excellent too."
Mar 2017,50,Lovely hotel,Really enjoyed our stay and would love to return.Only fault I could find was they could have a small shop on site for self catering guests as it is a bit of a walk to the nearest one.Apart from that perfect.
Mar 2017,40,All in all a good stay,"Rooms are clean and comfortable, swimming pools all clean and well kept however the website states there is an indoor pool but this is adults only and part of the spa which is additional to the cost of your stay. The hotel bars and restaurants are very expensive however if you go towards the town there are lots of other bars/restaurants to choose from. All in all a nice stay in a clean and welcoming environment."
Mar 2017,50,Portugal at its best,"Excellent resort with nice facilities. Stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment, good size with the necessary facilities. Excellent showers and hot water supply. Short walk to facilities outside the resort, so you weren't restricted on choice for food and drink."
Mar 2017,30,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa,"Advertised as 5 star, but maybe 4 or 4.5 is more accurate.  Staff great, food good, rooms clean, location good.  We were there in low season (March 17) and so not all bars were open and very little in way of entertainment.  Food and drinks are expensive.  Hotel is bit ""tired"" and could do with some maintenance.  Pools OK, but small and only 1 heated.  We expected to pay for spa treatments but found it unfortunate that you even have to pay to use steam room and sauna which are running anyway.  These really should be included in your room cost in my opinion.  Maybe it would be a better overall experience in high season."
Mar 2017,50,5 ***** STAR in EVERY WAY,"We booked through Jet 2, and we were absolutely delighted in every way. Our arrival at Reception immediately made us feel at home, smiling, welcoming, knowledgeable and very informative. We had booked a sea view room, and were allocated room 213. We couldn't have chosen better ourselves, with a fabulous view, lovely balcony and a huge bed, which we were later to learn was perhaps the most comfortable ever. The room facilities were excellent, lots of space, wardrobes, seats and a large bathroom, all spotlessly clean. Dinner was always lovely, as was the service (buffet), lots of choices, totally fresh and looking very inviting. Breakfast, likewise, lots of choice, great service and so appetising. The quality, choices and dining  room ambience, with great service is right up there with the very best. The hotel is so spacious, lovely pool and a huge outside area, a stunning beach, and everything, everywhere is so clean, fresh looking and just a great place to be. We have at least 3 holidays a year, and look forward to returning to the Grande Real Santa again, just wish we'd discovered it a lot sooner. Well done to everyone for a n outstanding experience, thank you."
Mar 2017,50,Perfect honey moon,"Excellent hotel, very helpful staf and well prepeared. The room with ocean view was exactly what we needed for a perfect honey moon. Breakfast was very tasty and we had planty options. The beach is very close, very clean."
Mar 2017,50,Three times a charm,"This was our third  year returning to this resort for a month. We stayed in the one bedroom self catering apartment.love the location . The staff remain kind ,helpful and professional. We had lots of Options   for activities / classes if we were interested( we are outdoor walkers so didn't take advantage of classes). The pool area is well maintained . Lobby remains a beautiful peaceful place. Evening entertainment certainly tried to meet demographic needs. We are comfortable here...feels like home. We would love to return."
Mar 2017,40,Chill by the pools overlooking the ocean,"Gorgeous pools, gorgeous staff. Couple of things not open due to off season. Just what we wanted. To sit by the pool and not have to go anywhere. A closer convenient store to buy bits throughout the day, bottles of water, ice cream etc would have been helpful."
Mar 2017,40,Great hotel,"Just spent 4 lovely nights in Santa Eulalia , our booking was B/B . Our room and the view from our patio out to the sea was so beautiful. It was a special celebration and management has delivered to our room a bottle of "" bubbles "" with sweet treats . I felt so special . Buffet breakfast had a great variety to suit all requests with bottles of "" bubbles "" free flowing , if that was your choice !! . Staff were very helpful and efficient . We used the shuttle bus to take us to the old town , this was a great service .We didn't eat our evening meal in the hotel as we didn't want to choose  buffet and felt it was expensive , there appeared to be very few people dining on the two nights we looked in . As the weather was quite unsettled , we decided to use the indoor pool . We were surprised to see nobody was using this facility .The charge to have  a swim in the leisure centre was 20 Euro each ,plus buy a swim hat !!! , I thought this was excessive . Perhaps , a few less bottles of "" bubbles "" at breakfast might be an idea , thus reducing the cost for guests to have a swin  ( in a very under used pool ) on a wet and windy morning . The walk down to the beach was lovely and we stopped off at the beachfront cafe for a light lunch or a cool drink . Very relaxing . Overall we had a lovely few days and I would like to think we will go back soon ."
Mar 2017,50,Pleasant place,"Lovely hotel. Stayed in a sea view suite which was nice. Staff all pleasant and couldn't be more helpful. My only criticism is that the food was never hot, it was always like warm so went cold quite quickly once you sat down. Other than that it was a lovely stay."
Mar 2017,30,Still Here!,"Arrived here last Saturday,lovely hotel we are staying in an apartment (437) near the road but that is no problem as cannot hear traffic.The apartment is well equipped and comfortable, cleaned to a high standard by the friendly staff, all hotel staff are courteous and helpfull and have made our stay enjoyable up to now.We have another 10 days here and just hope to get some food in the evening that is HOT we have spoken to resteraunt staff about this and live in hope of a hot meal  Breakfast is good......... porridge with LEMON is yet to be understood ???????Will wait to see if this is changed as allergic to lemon seem silly to add to the pot ? could just be made available to those who wish to add it.Evening entertainment is not up to much so be prepared to party in your own room as drink prices are high , or take a taxi into Albeufeira."
Mar 2017,40,Last minute holiday,"The hotel is situated above a beautiful sandy beach which can be reached through gates operated by your room key, although there are quite a few steps. The quality and presentation of the food offered on the half board basis was excellent, especially the fresh fruit and juices. We found the huge bed, in our apartment, very uncomfortable as it was far too hard, and the blanket and linen top very heavy so ended up sleeping on the sofas, but it was nice having the kitchenette. Overall, we felt happy with our choice of hotel, the grounds and surroundings areas were all looked after very well and there was a courtesy bus service into town, so would consider returning."
Mar 2017,30,"Lovely hotel, some very strange rules","On checking in we were not offered an upgrade even though I enquired about availability and was prepared to pay! Our room was in the self catering accommodation even though we were booked for B&B, which I had to prove to the receptionist by showing her an email confirmation! The room was right at the very back of the hotel accommodation even though it was obvious there were rooms available much closer to the main hotel. The room was clean, with a bedroom with twin beds and a third bed in the lounge (myself and my 2 grown up daughters were having a girly weekend). The bed in the lounge was very uncomfortable so next morning we asked if there were any other rooms available. We were show two rooms with sea views, much bigger with two bathrooms, and paid for an upgrade. The room was much nicer, but OMG the sofa bed was excruciating!!!!!!!  We were only there for 4 nights and having moved once already we decided to stay put and enjoy our stay. On returning from a night out we needed some water, we asked at reception and were told we had to order it from room service, which we questioned but were assured this was the only option! We were told that if we ordered two bottles we would not have to pay the room service charge.....not the case, when they arrived they charged us 11 Euro, which I challenged, the chap who delivered them clearly had no control over the price and we needed the water so I wrote a note on the receipt. On checkout the bill showed the 11 Euro, which I again challenged, I was told that is the rate for water throughout the hotel, which is certainly not the case, we had purchased several bottles of water throughout our stay, both from the main bar and the beach bar, and were charged 3.50 each. I pointed this out and he went off to check and came back to confirm I was correct, but still insisted that I pay 11 euros. I refused and asked to speak to a manager, I was informed there was not one available, which I found startling when you consider this was 9am on Monday morning and the resort is vast! After a long wait and several phone calls, they agreed to waive the charge. It wasn't the cost that was the issue, it was the principle, water should be readily available, and when you consider the cost of the rooms and the upgrade, plus we were on a B&B package, we should have had at least one complimentary bottle of water per day.  But it is a lovely hotel in a lovely location, but it is inconsistent and very expensive"
Mar 2017,50,Great location,"This is a 5 star hotel situated adjacent to Santa Eulalia beach.  We were in a 1 bedrom apartment where we were able to prepare our own meals if we wanted to.  15 - 20 min walk either direction were several restaurants to choose from if you did not want to eat in the hotel restaurants.  They also provide free shuttle 5 times a day to new town and old town, Albuferia.  This was a long stay package tour arranged through Merit Travel.From the various hotels we visited we definitely think we chose well.  I would stay here again and have no reservation recommending it to others.  The staff were particularly helpful.  We asked if we could move to a unit with a patio that had a southerly exposure and they willingly showed us another unit which we opted not to take."
Mar 2017,50,friendly staff lovely holiday,Lovely holiday bedroom view looking out to the sea very friendly staff everywhere very clean looked after.We had lovely weather we woke up to sunshine every day.The pool area and gardens well looked after.
Mar 2017,40,Fantastic cheap getaway,"Last minute getaway, so good value for money, perhaps that's why the club room was a little tired and the carpet was dirty. The normal 5 star touches were missing. No slippers, charge to have a kettle in the room, charge for the ironing board, charge for the sauna and spa. No compensation for indoor pool being closed. No sun loungers on the beach.Plus points, great location, nice hotel, food was great, breakfast choice was good with the fresh fruit being the highlight. On the whole a lovely 3 night break."
Mar 2017,10,NOT WORTHY OF 5 STARS!! ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!,"!!DO NOT STAY HERE!! I don't even know where to start. I have a celiac allergy and it was despicable how terribly they handled it -no gluten free options when they stated prior to our stay they had 'many' options! The staff didn't even understand what I was talking about! Appalling service! Stated 4 restaurants were open and only 2 were when we arrived! Awful apartment -dreadful decor, bad quality appliances, horrible bedding, freezing cold! No indoor facilities for winter months -tried to charge us ridiculous money to use the indoor 'spa' which was just a pool and jacuzzi which is NOT included in your stay! Completely misleading! Complained and got no where! NOT A 5* RESORT!"
Mar 2017,50,Its was very nice im Hotel and the Service was good!,The Breakfast was wonderful.The location of the Hotel was unique on the beach.Our Suite was very spacious ans well equipped.The hotel shuttle to Albufeira was good.The seaview was fantastic from the Balkony!
Mar 2017,50,Excellent hotel,Excellent hotel in a superb location superb beach. Superb rooms with a stunning view. Breakfast was very good and leisurely. Very good quality drinks a little expensive.  All staff very helpful.  A wonderful bottle of champagne delivered free on my eifes birthday.  Will be back.
Mar 2017,50,Great Hotel,"We really love staying at this hotel , we are repeat clients and have been coming here every year for the past 5years .Everything about this hotel from the moment you arrive until the day you depart is great , very friendly saf in all areas , rooms are well appointed and a good size ,the facilities and outdoor areas are great as is the location of the Hotel in relation to the old town Albufeira , also having the use of a shuttle bus into Albufeira .We can definitely recommend this hotel to anyone for a pleasant and enjoyable stay ."
Mar 2017,30,Disapointed,We were located beside the entrance to the garage which was very noisy.Also the entance to the property was close to our room with many trucks and buses going in and out of the property.We could not enjoy sitting outside and reading due to the noise.
Mar 2017,20,NOT a five star hotel.,"In all honesty, is a real big puzzle to me how this hotel is categorized as a five star hotel. Are they corrupted? Do they buy their stars? In any case, what this hotel offers is far away from what you would expect from a five star resort. I have read that some of the points I will make below have been pointed out by other guests already. Sadly, the hotel does not seem to address them in order to improve. Most probably, the most we will get is an '''automated reply''' to this post from the Hotel Manager, Jorge Texeira, as the other posts did.To put it brief,- the hotel is obviously old and the decoration / furniture are outdated, particularly in the rooms. Nevertheless, this is no reason to have a room FULL OF STAINS everywhere. Please find pictures attached. Keep in mind it s a five star hotel.- The first day we arrived, the hotel was more like a conference center. There was an event going on. A resort for relaxing, that was definitely not it.- Regarding smells, unfortunately we got all the smell from the hotel kitchen into our room (315). It was not possible to keep the windows open and to enjoy the sea view. No fresh ocean air for us, unfortunately, but grilled fish smell.- Only the most important items are provided, which are the towels and washing gel & shampoo. No slippers as declared on their website, not many TV channels, and would you not expect a small refrigerator with some cooled drinks in a five star hotel? But above all, NO KETTLE & CUPS & TEA / COFFEE in the room, to make a warm drink in the evenings. Even 3 star hotels are able to offer this service. When requested, we were offered a kettle. But what are we supposed to do with a kettle with no cups and no complimentary tea bags / coffee? When asked for cups  or a glass only (they charge 5 euros for tea bags), the answer from the hotel manager was, in a very unprofessional manner: do you expect here everything for free? - No, obviously not, but we do expect a minimum standard of service equivalent to 5 stars. - jaccuzzi,pool,hot tub is not included, you ll have to pay 20-30 euros for a about 45 min, ridiculous.-  the sinks do not drain the water, disgusting- cups in restaurants dirtyThe beach was ok, but all the beaches are nice in this area, so not special at all.We stayed the previous day in a 4 Star hotel (Porto Bay F)5 min away from this complex, and that was TRULY amazing and what you would expect, the view, the garden, the pools, the service was 100% better, cheaper"
Mar 2017,50,clear and comfortable hotel,"Service is very nice. And it is very comfortable hotel for vacation and rest.If the hotel operates some tour programs, it will be very nice for foreigners because many sites are not wolking distance.If someone does not rent a car, he/she will be isolated even though the hotel operates a free shuttle for new and old town."
Mar 2017,50,Excellent conference facilities,The hotel's food and service are excellent as are their conference facilities and conference services.  The conference services staff anticipate your needs and their coffee breaks offer a delightful array of goodies to go with one's coffee or tea.
Mar 2017,50,excellent mini break,"Excellent hotel with top notch facilities right on the beach, we had a suite which was spotlessly clean overlooking the sea, it is in a quiet location but the hotel has a courtesy bus which runs to both the old and new towns, the only complaints would be that the spa has only male masseurs and there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room"
Mar 2017,50,Excellent winter break,"Had a very relaxing stay at the GRSE in early March 2017. Arrived on my birthday and was surprised by a cake and bottle of bubbly. The hotel was spacious and clean with friendly staff and good facilities in a great location on the beach and near to shops and restaurants.Highlight was the breakfast - wonderful selection of fresh fruit, meats and cheeses, even bubbly on ice! Spent an afternoon in the spa and had the pool to ourselves and two relaxing treatments."
Mar 2017,40,Relaxing mini break,"The hotel its self is really lovely... our apartments were absolutely spotless. The selection for our breakfast was second to none, everything you could wish for to suit every diet. The only concern was when sat round the pool there was no where to get a drink or snack without going up to the bar in the main hotel. But as a whole our holiday was very nice."
Mar 2017,50,Grand stay,"Possibly the best accommodations my wife and I have ever enjoyed. Off the beaten path, but shuttle services and day trips allowed us to sample the local Portuguese food & culture.Beautiful beach, great buffet, comfortable rooms."
Mar 2017,40,wife's 50th birthday surprise weekend,"from the moment we arrived we were treated very well by all staff we came in contact with.the seaview room was what it says!(view of the sea). 3rd floor uninterrupted views overlooking beautiful bay .my only disappointment was the condition of the carpet in the room,stained and tired looking.the breakfast buffet was lovely and plenty to choose from.we did use the main bar for nightcaps and again pleased with service.we also used the pergola bar for lunch on the day we left and this was good food at a good price.while at the hotel we both used the spa facilities a full body massage was carried out by attentive and friendly staff.the hotel we found to be very well positioned for a trips into albufeira old town, also olhos d'agua both lovely places to spend time and eat lunch.we also found restaurants and bars around 10-15 mins walk from the hotel. we would definitely revisit and stay here again."
Mar 2017,50,Touring Portugal,"Enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. The room, the hotel, and location were very good.  All staff were very friendly and pleased to help answer any questions.  The only negative was the fact that the loud music from the discotheque played all night and disturbed our sleep.  However, overall that was a minor annoyance."
Mar 2017,30,Conference,The cleanliness of bathroom at level -2 should be improved. Hotel has very weak wifi connection. This should not be called a 5 star hotel. Hotel did not provide bottle of water everyday. The room should give queen size bed instead of combine single twin beds. A/C is not cool or not working well. SAD!!!
Mar 2017,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa,"Great hotel, just needs tv channels upgrading as all either Portuguese  Spanish or German which is not great considering predominately British guests, Room service was good. Excellent facilities at the hotel and very good food."
Mar 2017,50,Wonderful hotel,"Wonderful hotel in a wonderful location. Food and service, as well as rooms, are superb. The buffet consisted in a wide variety of dishes always fresh and tasty, ranging from vegetables to delicious fish. Recommended for sure."
Mar 2017,40,"Lovely hotel, bit out the way and not all staff were polite!","Stayed here for a 4 night stay. We stayed in the apartments which we could not fault they were lovely, very spacious and had everything we needed. The reception staff were very welcoming and polite however the lady serving in the bar wasn't quite so nice! There was no bars open near the pool and no service so you had to go up to main reception for drinks. I had a few drinks so asked for a tray to which she was very abrupt and rude. I didn't get a tray so had to make 2 trips to get he drinks back to the poolside!The hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk in to the main strip and there is a bank however we didn't mind this although it may be an issue for some people.Would definitely recommend the hotel, just don't expect politeness at the bar!"
Mar 2017,40,Relaxing vacation,Excellent location for an easy relaxing vacationMore options for dinner would have improved our stay but we were off season so this may be better in the summerThe beach was accessible and the view was magnificent
Mar 2017,40,Sun and sangria!,"The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the food excellent. The Resort is huge and if you have any difficulties with walking make sure you have a room close to the main Reception/pool area. If you are catching the courtesy bus into town ensure you are there early as it only seats 27 however the staff will remind you of this. I think it would be helpful for there to be more scheduled times for the bus as the only alternative is a taxi in both directions or a long,long walk. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and made use of the Spa also."
Mar 2017,40,Good,The hotel was great but the agent Sunmaster were terrible. I won't be using Sunmaster again but would definitely stay at this hotel if I ever travel to this area. I would strongly recommend the hotel. The location is great
Mar 2017,50,AWESOME stay - excellent hotel and staff,"Loved the Hotel setting, facilities, and staff. We booked through a Travel Agent and selected the property based upon the closeness to the beach. Some hidden ""gems"" that were not known was (a) the 3 daily free fitness classes with very happy & enthusiastic instructors, (b) Portuguese lessons by awesome lady named Marta and (c) nightly entertainment.Property and rooms in excellent condition.Food good at various venues on the property.Even though we were ""off-season"", all the staff were AWESOME."
Mar 2017,50,Excellent service and hotel,"Excellent hotel. The service was very good and quick. Fantastic view from our hotel room and balcony. Nice pools. Beautiful beach. Food very fresh and tasty. Spa nice and fresh, could have been free of charge or cheaper though. Will come back!"
Mar 2017,40,Great week ,Stayed here for a week with my husband for our wedding anniversary and had a great time. We stayed in an apartment with a beautiful garden view. Great location as you are only 10 minutes walk away from bars & restaurants. Bedrooms cleaned every day. Shuttle bus available daily to go into the old town (well worth a visit!). Staff were all very friendly.
Mar 2017,40,Nice place to be,We where here for a dinner at Restaurant Ocean with a group and stayed in Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa for two nights. We had a great time in this hotel and can recommand this hotel for a stay at Albufeira. We might come back with our families next year or this year in autum.
Mar 2017,50,Beautiful hotel,We had a fantastic 4 night stay at this hotel. Location is lovely. Sea view room is well worth the extra money.  Beach is on the doorstep and 20 min walk takes you to bars and restaurants. The bed is massive and very comfy.  The room was a bit dated but the rest of the hotel is 5 star. Plenty of choice at breakfast.  The hotel delivered a bottle of champagne to our room as a birthday treat. All the Staff are friendly.  I highly recommend booking this hotel. Can't wait for a return visit.
Mar 2017,40,Not quite five star,"Difficult to gauge at this time of year because not all facilities were available,especially restaurants.The staff are very friendly and helpful.The location with its own stunning beach is exceptional,but I feel it was under exploited by the hotel,that's why I would say four star not five.I must say a big thank you to the hotel for giving my partner a bottle of Brut and birthday cake to her birthday."
Mar 2017,50,Very nice stay,"We stayed in studio apartment with garden view, which was very spacious and comfortable.  The spa is quite expensive, so we didn't use it.  Plenty of restaurants offering better value than the hotel within a 15 minute walk."
Mar 2017,50,Albufeira/ Algarve February,"This is a five star resort but could easily be a six star!  Excellent in all regards.  Everything from our check in to our checkout and the three weeks in between was extremely pleasant with always helpful staff. We stayed in apartment 482 probably the only one with a balcony view of the ocean,fantastic!We had a pleasant surprise when we returned home after a day trip. The hotel had placed a birthday cake and a bottle of champagne on ice in our room as it was my birthday day, just another touch of class from a very classy resort, thanks.Room was excellent and maid service every day was great, the private beach was stunning and very close.The free shuttles to old and new town was outstanding very timely for going and return.Grocery store within 15 minute walk and great selection of restaurants within 20 minutes.Overall excellent and beyond our expectations, highly recommend this resort.One note re. your tours....use Ticket Shop as their tours and prices were better than the hotel was allowed to provide"
Mar 2017,50,no coffee or tea facilities in the room,"A very warm and friendly hotel with many facilities, next to the sea and including a big conference center. I  stayed in a suite but no coffee or tea facilities in the room.on request I received a water boiler.Today in a 5 star hotel you may expect coffee and tea facilities in the room."
Mar 2017,40,better than 4 star,"wonderful location, rooms very good but a little bit dated, tea and coffee in room would be nice, bus to run to old later at night would great.  all in all a fantastic hotel, I will be back please God, Thanks for everything.."
Mar 2017,50,Location location,Great location. Shuttle service to old and new town a bonus. Excellent wifi. A special thanks to Steven a and reception staff for allowing us to change the location of our apartment. Will be back next year.
Feb 2017,50,Fantastic hotel,"Just spent 5 days in this beautiful hotel and had a fantastic time. We booked a resort view room and yes when they say resort view it did overlook the carpark as previous reviews have mentioned,  but this was obviously reflected in the price and the rooms were clean and comfortable so we have no complaints. The hotel itself was well presented with access to a beautiful stretch of beach.  The hotel has a lovely snack bar overlooking the beach and for the quality and portion size it is not expensive and makes for a very convenient and picturesque setting for lunch. The highlight of the the hotel was the breakfast with its extensive range of pastries, fruit, cheeses and hot selection all too appealing for the waist line. The hotel has a Spa and as they had an offer on for access to the Spa and massage it seemed too good an opportunity to miss.  The Spa is most definitely not an indoor pool, it is a salt water hydrotherapy pool with 6 different stations and well worth a visit if you are like me and really enjoy going to a Spa.  This and the 50 minute massage was well worth the €110 for two people.  All the staff we met were very pleasant including the ones in the Spa which only added to our holiday. The hotel does provide a shuttle bus which was very handy but the hotel isn't so far out that you can't walk into the old town, approximately 40 minute.  I will definitely be booking this hotel for my next visit to Portugal."
Feb 2017,50,Nice luxurious stay,Beautiful location overlooking the sea . Great pool areas . 1st class service from reception and baggage handling customer service . Apartment was spacious and comfortable . Nice clean grounds and ample parking spaces .
Feb 2017,50,Ecellent hotel in an excellent location,"This hotel is in a lovely position just outside Albefeira.   The hotel puts on a free bus to both the New Town and Old Town, however, it is a nice walk.   It took up 40 minutes to walk back from Old Town Albufeira.  Definitely worth a sea view bedroom."
Feb 2017,50,Great location,We have stayed at this hotel before and can recommend it to any prospective visitor. Beautiful beach setting and lovely public spaces and bar/restaurant facilities. Daily free bus service from the hotel is very convenient. Beach is beautiful and bar/restaurant facilities there are also very good and fairly priced.
Feb 2017,40,Lovely short break in a good quality hotel,"We stayed self catering in the apartments within the resort. These were clean and spacious although a little dated but we're very comfortable with a comprehensive maid service every day. The hotel itself has a lovely atmosphere and feels like a five star hotel. Fabulous views of the lovely and very private beach from the hotel terraces. Staff friendly and efficient, overall a very relaxing experience.There are a number of outdoor pools and one of these was very well heated so we could swim comfortably even though it was only around 18 degrees outside.Kids club is free to guests and operates all year round, staff very friendly and easy going.Breakfast in the Atlantico cafe overlooking the beach is very reasonable and well worth a visit. Prices in the other hotel restaurants are a bit steep but a 4 euro taxi ride or 15 minute walk will take you to a number of good restaurants and bars in nearby Santa Eulalia.Hoping to return next year, thank you for a memorable stay."
Feb 2017,50,Can't wait to go back,The best location and staff are so pleasant this was our 5th holiday here 12 of us and we so look forward to our return visit We had the best time so comfortable all the family enjoyed the relaxation  😊
Feb 2017,50,Gorgeous hotel,"Absolutely loved this hotel.  Stayed 6 nights with my husband in Feb, we had a sea view room (115) which was amazing.  The room was big and had the biggest bed I have ever seen, big bathroom and large totally private balcony.  The room and all the public areas were spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was fabulous, everything regularly topped up and loads of choice.  The breakfast restaurant overlooked the sea and didn't feel cramped at all. We didn't have any other meals in the hotel so can't comment on them.  All the staff were really helpful and nothing was too much trouble.  The location is quite a walk from the new town/Strip areas and a long walk from the Old Town but this is what makes this hotel special, it's location is truly stunning. A courtesy bus runs several times a day to new/old town but a taxi to Old Town only cost us €8 and €4 to the Strip. We've been back home a day and I'm already planning our return. The hotel was quiet when we were there until the last night when it was busy as there was a large Salsa dance event being held. Can't wait to return."
Feb 2017,40,lovely hotel,"the hotel is very clean and in a very nice location.. the beach is right outside. it has multiple restaurants in the resort itself. we stayed for 6 nights. the hotel also had a free bus service to the centre. they were also organising a trip to the loupe carnival for a very cheap price but unfortunately we were leaving that day. the staff is very cordial and helpful. my only complaint would be vegetarian options. but i guess thats not the hotel problem that i don't eat eggs and meat or fish! i did get fed up of the same breakfast for 6 days and also they didn't have much to offer for lunch and dinners so i had to always think of options outside the resort. i also missed having the tea and kettle facilities in the room, however, they were kind to deliver the kettle to the room. we had to ask for the cups in the bar. also they have plastic glasses in the rooms which i really think must be replaced with glass...!!"
Feb 2017,50,great time!,"Very good location, big variety of choice in breakfast and dinner, nice staff, great services, great value for money. Got massage in the spa. If you wanna go back home relaxed, do this the day before you leave and your feeling of vacation will stay longer.... (it did for us)"
Feb 2017,50,Leisure stay,All staff very professional and helpful thoroughly enjoyed our short stay wish it was longer all services easy to accessIdeal location plenty of room to move around and not be disturbed if reading Very clean and interesting furniture
Feb 2017,50,"The Grande Real Sante Eulalia Hotel has definitely got the ""Wow!"" Factor","From arrival to departure, the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff was fantastic. The cleanliness of the whole hotel was of the highest standard. The quality and variety of the food was superb."
Feb 2017,50,Another enjoyable visit,"This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel.  We again enjoyed the wonderful setting.  Our sea view room was more than sea view we were able to watch the waves beating on the beach so restful and calming.  The food in the main restaurant was varied and tasty and special mention of Mario who served breakfast a real asset to the hotel.From receptionists to those who served in the restaurant and those who serviced the room, everyone really helpful.  A truly wonderful stay and in a lovely environment."
Feb 2017,50,I will definitely go back.,Beautiful location. Friendly efficient staff. Very clean. The English tv channels were only news and CBS Reality. But I didn't go on holiday to watch tv. The location was ideal you can walk to Albufeira old town in about 45 mins.
Feb 2017,50,best holiday ever,"we travelled as a family with three small children,two under two and one six year old. We also had two grandparents and everybody hugely enjoyed their holiday particularly the six year old.He was very sad having to leave and would happily have stayed at the kids club .The staff at the club were so kind ,helpful ,friendly and caring."
Feb 2017,50,Excellent holiday resort for relaxation and pampering.,"Own private beach, excellent breakfast and taxi services are fabulous. Great spa services and free wifi. Lives upto a 5 star grade. You can choose a room with a selected view. Ask for any thing special and it will be provided if possible."
Feb 2017,40,Third Time Here,"We have stayed in an Apartment and Studio 3 times now and find them fully equiped ,comfortable and clean,towels and bedding changed every day.Perfect for a self catering holiday or other board category if you like the independance of your own place and you can use every facility of the hotel as well.I highly recommend this hotel."
Feb 2017,50,Amazing hotel you will not be disappointed.,Stayed in a Garden studio. Clean to a very high standard. Great location. Very friendly staff always willing to help or advise.  Free bus to town. Had luggage delivered to door for us. Highly recommended. We will be using this hotel again.
Feb 2017,50,A beautiful place,Thoroughly recommend this hotel. Situated 10 min walk out of centre. Beautiful hotel surroundings and spa. Very attentive staff. Free shuttle bus taking guests to old and new town. Excellent wifi coverage across hotel.
Feb 2017,50,Excellent place to stay,"Stayed with my family in this hotel, wow it was amazing and best place to stay, room was clean and food in Portugal you never go wrong, Only little concern is driving is on other side unlike London took few days to set my head around"
Feb 2017,40,Our third stay,"We were a bit disappointed that we did not have a better view from our room. Not sure what we need to do in future to have a FULL sea view. Last year we overlooked the tennis court and this year our room was directly above the swimming pool, which we found quite noisy at times.The cleaning of our room was very inconsistent depending on the staff. We had to call them back on occasion because the room was dusty and the bathroom was not cleaned. I think it could do with a check from time to time.Apart from this we always find the staff so kind, polite and willing to help."
Feb 2017,50,"Excellent hotel, top location, first class food quality and choice.","Excellent location, service and food. First class gym and spa. Relaxing with attentive service when required. Free bus to town and hotel very useful. Everything you would want from a 5 star hotel. Definitely be back."
Feb 2017,50,Very high standard ,"This hotel is fabulous we have 1 more night to spend on B&B. We upgraded to a sea view suite well worth the extra cost. 2 flat screen televisions, 2 bathrooms 1 with a whirlpool bath, bath robes a huge bed and 2 balconys. Full gymnasium 2 outdoor pools 1 heated. An Atlantic restaurant beautiful views of the beach below. Very relaxed atmosphere. The breakfast was superb nice and leisurely and long. We ate once in the Bougda restaurant and it was well presented the staff attentive very enjoyable. All the staff are exceptional very professional. All areas of the hotel are kept to a very high standard of cleanliness. Would we visit again most certainly."
Feb 2017,50,Lovely hotel in a good location,"We have just returned from a five night stay in this hotel. The staff were really friendly and we had a great breakfast each morning. The location for us was great but we did have a hire car so it was easy to get around and to local restaurants. The rooms were really clean but a bit dated, especially the carpets. We booked this hotel at a great price out of season and I am sure we will return."
Feb 2017,50,Lovely stay,"Great couple of days spent at our wedding venue. Really looking forward to coming back in 1st September. Hotel and staff all lovely, food and drinks great. Rooms very big but in need of a little TLC!!"
Feb 2017,50,Very good hotel in lovel position,"Can't fault hotel, staff or  beachside setting - bubbly and cake for my husbands birthday delivered to our room - lovely surprise.  We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely be returning soon. Would recommend this hotel highly."
Feb 2017,50,Cant Fault it,"Had a great half term week with 2 boys 11 and 12. Large suite with 2 bathrooms, 2 Tv's, mini fridge. Excellent buffet breakfast, never got bored. Heated outdoor pool was swimable, sea and very nice beach as close as needed. Atlantico cafe lovely to sit and relax in afternoon with sea view."
Feb 2017,50,Holiday with friends,"We've just returned from our 3rd stay at this hotel, this time bringing friends with us and they were as impressed with everything about the friendliness,helpfulness of all the staff as we are.The quality and variety of the food is 1st class.Thank you to everyone for making this another very special stay, can't wait to return."
Feb 2017,50,Another amazing stay at this hotel.,Just back from a 3 night stay at this beautiful hotel. Stayed here for the first time in February 2015 and loved it returned on the15-18th of February this year and yet again another great experience.. hotel is beautiful right on the beach the views are amazing the rooms are spacey and clean and the food is great. Also the staff are very nice and always happy to help.Free hotel shuttle bus which runs daily to the new and old town.  We love it so much we are already looking for another stay with with our 2 children in the coming months..
Feb 2017,50,Great stay,"Fantastic stay, really enjoyed as a short break, would love to return for a longer stay. Great food, fantastic selection for breakfast. Really attentive staff and shuttle bus to old and newtowns was very helpful."
Feb 2017,50,Definitley Five Stars,"The hotel had a great feel to it from the moment I arrived.  The staff were very courteous & explained everything about the hotel & its facilities accurately.  The rooms are well equipped, well maintained & spacious.  The facilities are excellent & the postion outstanding.  There are great views from everywhere & the beach is amazing for long walks.  The walks over the cliffs are equally as good & the views are a photographic delight.  The food is excellent & the staff are very attentive.  There is a free courtesy bus into both the new & old towns.  Will definitely return to this hotel.  My only minor gripe was there there are no tea & coffee making facilities in the room, otherwise a perfect stay."
Feb 2017,40,Lovely Hotel,"The breakfast is super, you could not ask for more choice. We didn't use the restaurants other than for breakfast as we used the hotel as a base to explore the area. I was in room 113, with a lovely sea view for a couple of nights but due to the heavy rain my bathroom started another shower through the ceiling. I was moved to room 105 and - fortunately kept my sea view :) The rooms are lovely, very spacious. The only fault with cleanliness was the stains on my carpet (around the fridge area). The hotel staff are lovely - even if some things do get lost in translation occasionally. By way of an apology for my bathroom leaks and having to move rooms I was offered room service coffee and cake - which was a nice gesture but turned into a comedy of errors. Eventually coffee was served in my room but with a couple of biscuits - one should never offer a lady cake and deliver boring biscuits! :) I tried emailing the customer service manager but the email bounced back as undelivered from the email address provided. If you stay at this hotel please, please take care in the local area at night, one of our party was mugged and badly injured when walking back from Albufeira town. The reception staff were very kind when she returned from the hospital. The ceiling in the lobby area is a work of art.  It is a shame that the hotel want to charge for use of the indoor swimming pool - I think this policy should be looked at. On the whole I give it 4 stars."
Feb 2017,50,Best hotel in Albufeira,"Myself and my fiancé stayed here in February and have stayed previous times before. We stayed in a studio apartment which was spacious clean and the bed was brill. Everything about this hotel is outstanding. The staff are always happy and willing to help, the food in the different selections of restaurants is beautiful and the views and location are amazing. Having our niece with us this time we were also able to appreciate the quality of the Children's facilities. There is an all year round kids club as well. The hotel is a 10 minute into the new town. My fiancé and I are hoping to get married here. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and you will not be disappointed with your stay."
Feb 2017,50,Excellent,"Excellent stay, amazing food and clean rooms, personnel very friendly, responsive and helpful. Guidelines provided regarding the area and places to visit. Fantastic location next to the beach and very well organized hotel surroundings"
Feb 2017,10,Minus Five Stars,"First  time in a five star hotel.   Food luke warm. Plates taken away before finishing eating,  No activities, poor entertainment, Isolated away from any town. €20 for one hour each for indoor pool. A bit much."
Feb 2017,40,Personal experience,"My wife and I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. When we arrived we were informed that we had been upgraded from a studio room to a one bed apartment thus availing us the chance to make our own meals! What a pleasant surprise! The staff are really kind, professional and friendly, language barriers not withstanding."
Feb 2017,40,Leisure Stay,Staff very good Food very good and not badly priced compared with other similar hotels  Facilities ok but a bit limited  Very disappointed to find in February when weather was bad  that indoor pool had become part of spa complex which you had to pay 20 Euros to swim Also surprised that the hotel did not provide Irons and ironing boards in rooms  Charged 5 Euros a day a facility which is FOC of charge in similar hotels Was pleasantly surprised not to be charged for the room safe which is always charged for in hotels we have stayed
Feb 2017,50,Great holiday,Fantastic hotel and Great location. The staff were extremely accommodating. We came as a big group with 13 children and the kids club facilities were great. There is also a go ape adventure place across the road which was great value for money. Would Defo recommend this hotel and would love to stay again. Xxx
Feb 2017,50,great place,Wonderful place great value will hopefully be back again. Good location lovely beach friendly staff. rooms clean and very big for a studio. Didnt eat in the restaurant beuase there are plenty of restaurants nearby. All in all an excellent holiday.
Feb 2017,10,Return visit .not impressed ,"Only getting around to leaving our review now.we stayed here previously and our holiday was amazing we gave it 5 stars however this time around we were very disappointed. The hotel seems to cater for a lot of business conferences and during our stay there was a large contingent of pharmaceutical/ medical reps staying aswell, whilst we lay by the pool they were having mini meetings around us in suits and formal wear and when we came home in the evening with a few drinks on board we had to deal with the glares of disapproval from the many exhausted professionals who hung about the bar and reception to carry on with the days business. We wouldnt return to this hotel,whilst it is beautiful we felt like we vacated in an office block with swimming pools"
Feb 2017,40,great views,"nice studio , staff helpful, free bus to old and new town (did not run from 1 to 4 oclock)free activities in spa although free use of indoor pool would be useful even if for an hour  a dayfun works around cost to olhos d'aqua"
Feb 2017,50,Stayed in Feb for 4 days,"Beautiful hotel,would recommend paying a little extra for room with sea view.Staff really friendly and helpful. Only had breakfast in hotel but there was plenty of choice and was all really lovely. Will be revisiting this hotel again."
Feb 2017,40,February Break.,We stayed at the beginning of February 2017 and enjoyed our stay. The staff were all friendly and extremely helpful. We were however disappointed to find on arrival that only guests who have paid for the spa are allowed to use the indoor swimming pool. The main reason we booked the hotel was due to the apparent availability of an indoor pool. On another note - this is a beautiful hotel but it's a shame that some selfish guests feel the need to allow their children to play football in the main reception and bar areas AND within the confines of the restaurant when other guests are trying to eat breakfast. These families also seem to think it is acceptable to allow children to roller skate around the hotel and in particular the restaurant where hot food is being served. Perhaps staff at the hotel could pass on some house rules to these ignorant parents / families who are obviously not used to staying in five star accommodation?
Feb 2017,40,Great Resort,"This is a fantastic hotel right on the beach front. The staff are a huge asset to this hotel.Food was delicious especially breakfast. Rooms were spacious ( if a little dated ) and clean. My only complaint was that staff seemed to have very  little control of kids running riot in the bar area at night , no parental supervision ( even though parents were nearby )I am talking about 8-10 kids out of control !! It spoiled our time in the bar and we ended up leaving which was a pity ...."
Feb 2017,50,Outstanding hotel,"Outstanding hotel in a beautiful location overlooking a sandy beach.We had a double seaview room(207)Very spacious with large bathroom including a huge bath!Breakfast excellent,huge amount of choice.Staff superb,could no do enough for you.We celebrated our Wedding Anniversary whilst here and on our arrival back from dinner that night we found petit fours and a bottle of bubbly waiting for us in our room.Would highly recommend this hotel and won't hesitate to return here again if revisiting this area."
Feb 2017,50,Amazing,"From the word go we were impressed by the overall surroundings and then staff and the amenities sealed the deal- we were on the Paul Claffey country music tour & had a fantastic time. The hotel, staff and scenery are worth every penny"
Feb 2017,50,Birthday trip,Great hotel good quality and very smart. Good service and very modern and clean. Free shuttle to old and new town. Great stay would come again - slightly out from main area but only 15 minutes walk. Excellent view on theses front - highly recommended
Feb 2017,40,Spa day,"I visited this resort last week as it was recommended to me by a local for a spa day as the hotel I was staying in didn't have one. The spa itself is OK. It has a gym,  sauna,  steam room and jacuzzi. I booked my treatments 1 day earlier to guarantee my slot and I had a full body massage and reflexology,  the treatment cost came to 145 euros but you had to pay 20 euros extra to access the facilities I. E swimming pool/sauna etc. Now for me, when I have been to 5* resort spas before,  if you are having numerous treatments and spending quite a bit of money then the access to the facilities has always been free. The pool has jet massages which were pleasant, jacuzzi area and loungers which I was expecting to be heated. They also have a relax area with whicker seats which was lovely to chill. The treatments themselves were unfortunately a little disappointing,  I was expecting 5* treatments and felt they were actually only a 3 star. The massage was awful,  I did not get any pleasure out of it at all,  it was supposed to be relaxing and the whole method was fast and brash. The reflexology was better but still not up to scratch for a 5 star,  I've definitely had better. The grounds,  reception and out door pool areas were magnificent and would defo look at booking here to stay if ever back in portugal but spa was a little disappointing."
Feb 2017,40,Off season stay,"Our first time in Portugal so didn't really know what to expect but were not disappointed by the overall experience of the hotel . The staff could not have been more helpful, the place was spotless and the food was of excellent quality. The free shuttle bus to the old town was an added bonus. I think if the bar prices had been more affordable the evening entertainment would have attracted more of a crowd"
Feb 2017,50,Lovely Hotel,"This is definitely a 5* star hotel very clean and staff was friendly and very helpful.  We had sea view room and was not disappointed.  We went half board and could not fault breakfast and dinner, again very much 5*. It was my husband's birthday whilst we were there and to our surprise they delivered a cake and a bottle of prosecco the presentation was so lovely candles etc. The bed was bigger than a king size and so comfy.  Hopefully we will be back soon."
Feb 2017,20,Long weekend Feb2017,We went as a large party of 17 which included my son who is 10. For a hotel that promotes family friendly visitors there was nothing for children to do. He indoor pool was restricted to adults which left children to go to the outside pool in the rain and wind. I find this way of thinking thoughtless and can definitely say we will not be back.
Feb 2017,30,Not 5 star,"Stayed in quite a few 5star hotels,this definitely is not, I would say possibly 4 star.at a push. Rooms very dated,rooms described as resort view should say car park view. Breakfast average, coffee out of machines were awful, best of all was fruit. No fresh orange juice, or option to have fresh coffee.Never known a hotel where you have to pay to use the indoor pool. Hotel wifi good. Hotel very clean and cleaning staff were very pleasant unlike reception and dining room staff who were mostly pretty miserable. Cleaning staff we're the ones who spoke to us the most. We were not originally given cards for towels and Elisabeth on reception would not give my husband any because we had not got a card. I went and a male receptionist, unfortunately I didn't get his name, gave me replacement cards and towels straight away. Bus service to town very useful. Bar prices expensive and perhaps if they were slightly lower more guests would visit the bar area. Beach area was beautiful. Would we stay here again,probably not."
Feb 2017,40,Generally good...,"I'm writing this this review now, whilst I'm still in the frame of mind to do so with out being clouded by a post holiday glow. The hotel is amazing, beautiful and very clean. Very helpful reception staff and all staff from cleaners to waiters to reception were visibly dedicated to their work. We only stayed B&B and the breakfast was amazing with so much choice (hot food not really hot), I sense you can feel a 'but' coming on....BUT, today on our penultimate day we sat down to breakfast. My partner had on his plate 4 bread rolls and on a separate plate some ham and cheese and tomato. We were going to have these for breakfast. As we'd had cooked food all week. My partner stood up to get some napkins from behind him and no sooner had he picked them up they were snatched out of his hand by a waitress, she was accompanied by a lady who looked like a floor supervisor who accused us, very rudely of wanting to take the food away with us, and insisted that if this wasn't the case, we should only need one napkin. The restaurant was full of people and I don't think I have ever felt so humiliated! When I said that no, we weren't doing that, and that one napkin would be fine, she handed it to me and walked off. No word of apology at all. My partner had his back pack with him as he was going straight to the shop after we had eaten to get some water and coke. I can see why this could have looked like we had a 'packed lunch plan' but after 20 years in the trade myself, I am full aware that you can never make assumptions. I'm sorry to go on but I am so angry about this. To be fair, we have paid to stay at a 5* hotel, if we wanted to take some food with us then so what (we didn't!).Over all good stay though now I feel I wouldn't recommend it purely because of what has just happened."
Feb 2017,50,excellent place to stay in Algarve,"staff really made our stay great with recommendations on what to do, especially small out of the way places that were amazing. apartments were large and pleasant and the beach is in front of the property.able to access trips easily."
Feb 2017,50,Excellent Hotel in excellent location,"This hotel can be highly recommended, it is located at a very nice strip of sandy beach which invites for long beach walks. The facility is kept in excellent shape and deserves its 5 star rating without question.We stayed there for a week in beginning of February, in low season and the hotel was not fully booked which made it even more enjoyable and having the added value of offering a high value for a moderate price. Can be highly recommended."
Feb 2017,30,SPA NOT FREE,"Although the rooms and service was okay (room a bit put dated) i really thought the indoor pool, spa and that would be free as a hotel guest. I can understand paying for massage but not the pool which was £20 per hour. that was very disappointing and the SPA staff were very rude. Reception staff were okay."
Feb 2017,40,Beautiful place in a beautiful setting,"We love the Algarve and this hotel was a cherry on the cake. The hotel was very quiet apart from a lot of weddings each day due to its lovely setting and location. The beach infront of the hotel is quite small but wait for the tide to go out and you can walk for miles. We stayed self catering in an apartment, there is no oven, just a 2 ring hob and the apartment could do with some updating hence the 4 star rating. The smaller pools were lovely to chill by or visit the large pool and watch dolphins in the sea. The restaurants around the hotel are lovely. Walk in to Albufeira in about 30 minutes or take the free minibus. I would recommend highly."
Feb 2017,30,Nice hotel,"All in all our stay was very nice, having even received a room upgrade free of charge. I suppose that value wise everything was fine. But in my view the rooms need some refreshing touches and a water boiler with coffee/tea making option iwould not go amiss in a so-called 5 star hotel. Also, Wifi in our room was awful!. Breakfast was average - allthough there is a good choice of food, the quality is just okay, with the exception of the fresh fruit that was excellent (and the coffee is very good as well).  The best thing about this hotel is the location - you cannot beat that! Close to shops, beach just in front, just great!"
Feb 2017,50,Couples Leisure break,"Had a great mini break for excellent value, resort was quiet due to being out of season but that suited us fine. Several football teams were staying at the hotel too but they kept themselves quiet and well behaved. We'll definitely be back, it was excellent value."
Feb 2017,50,Third stay of hopefully many more.,"This was the third time my wife and I have stayed at the Grand Real Santa Eulalia, each time in January and we love this hotel. The location is excellent for exploring locally or further afield. A courtesy bus is provided for trips to nearby Albufeira. On arrival, the staff are very welcoming and friendly and all speak very good English. I would recommend a sea view room as the views of the Atlantic are stunning. The rooms are spacious and clean although we noticed that the carpets are looking a little tired. The air con is brilliant, there is a fridge and a TV but no kettle this visit so we asked for one to be provided and the staff were happy to do this. The bed is enormous and very comfortable. The basis of our stay was bed and breakfast although we did dine at the hotel on our first evening and the food was excellent. There is a great variety for breakfast and no problem if you like a hearty English one. Towels are provided if you wish to use any of the swimming pools which are small but clean. One of the advantages of going at this time of year is that the hotel is generally quiet so absolutely no problem in acquiring a sunbed or with service at the bar. The slight disadvantage is that parts of the hotel are closed during the winter months and of course, the weather can be unpredictable. Overall, this hotel cannot be faulted for location, service, food and cleanliness. I recommend it highly and will definitely be returning."
Feb 2017,50,Summer Holiday July 2016,Beautiful Location and only a 15 minute walk to perfect bars & restaurant choices.  Would thoroughly recommend.  The beach is gorgeous and restaurants & Nightlife not too far Away.  Check out what is recommended on Trip Advisor.
Feb 2017,50,Lovely place! ,Wonderfully located and well equipped hotel! Its truly a place where you can spend several days without having to step out at all. The breakfast is very good and each restaurant serves excellent food. The beach is a five minute walk and you can ask for a room with a view of the ocean - what more can one want.
Feb 2017,50,Excellent Value,"First visit to this hotel in January really enjoyed our stay room was large and comfortable and very quiet only sounds at night were the waves from the sea,this hotel was great value for the price.Will definitely be returning."
Feb 2017,50,Very comfortable with great service,"We are halfway through a week long stay for my partner's special birthday. We have found the staff on the whole very helpful and friendly. They even laid on a cake and bottle of bubbly in our apartment for when we returned after a day out on Julia's Birthday. We have had first class treatment all the time and unlike some of the other reviewers I feel it deserves its 5 star rating. The restaurants are quite expensive, but then you are eating very well produced food in a very nice setting right by the sea. My top tip is to have breakfast in the small café restaurant, I think it's called Atlantico, down near the beach."
Jan 2017,50,excellent stay,"we have stayed in this area a few times now and this is by far the best hotel ,staff where so very helpful also it was birthday and we where given champange which was sent to our  room which was unexpected"
Jan 2017,50,Wineman,"Had a great stay at hotel everything was great,from arrival to leaving.The staff were very good and very polite. Would recommend a stay to everyone who wants to chill out . Easy access to everywhere with hotel providing shuttle bus."
Jan 2017,50,Wonderful,"I had a wonderful time, everybody was very kind all the time and I felt really comfortable and safe. The service was always excellent, breakfast outstanding, amazing sea view, Spa was also really nice..."
Jan 2017,50,Quick break ,We arrived and was met by a pleasant young man very polite and helpful. We went to book in staff very helpful as we were staying in self-catering we got a lift on a golf kart it wasn't far from main reception it was incase we got lost.... Lol. Beach just outside the back gate and it is all about security as you need key card to access it and get back in. House keeping was very good also. It's quite this time of year but good for wee break. I would definitely come back.
Jan 2017,50,A week in January,We are back home after a relaxing week in this wonderful location.This hotel stands out from others because of the professionalism and friendliness of the staff.Nothing was too much trouble.  We will be returning at  the first opportunity.
Jan 2017,30,A weeks break,"The hotel was very good albeit a bit dated, spotlessly clean. rooms very roomy. No tea/coffee facilities in the room , this was a disappointment as no coffee or water available elsewhere. We were delayed at Portugal airport waiting for a passenger that did not arrive so we missed our breakfast, nothing else provided. Breakfast excellent choice. Dinner hardly any choice for vegetarians !! The main disappointment was the spa facilities spa pool.On booking we were told we had use of the pool. When trying to enter the pool we were told it was 17 euros each to enter.  I complained to the manager who said we could get a taxi into Albufeira and use the public pool. With a return journey this would have cost 23 euros. The manager gave us a free pass for the indoor pool, he said it would be 33 degrees . It was as cold as the outdoor pool and the ceiling pouring in with water. Spoilt the holiday"
Jan 2017,50,Beautiful relaxing holiday,"We thoughly enjoyed spending our holiday in the Grande Real Santa Elulia Hotel. We went half board . If you enjoy fine dining with delicious dishes to choose from this is a must. You will not be disappointed.  You can choose another Restaurant in the Hotel that does other menus also. Look up web site for menusThe service from the moment you walked through the doors of the Hotel is 1st class. All the staff are so warm, friendly and courteous.  The views are beautiful from the Hotel & the lay out of the Hotel is amazing. Who ever designed it thought of everything. The Real Spa Therapy was truely a relaxing & enjoyable experience.  They are really an  amazing group of people who are dedicated in providing a great service & work diligently to make you feel relaxed & comfortable while having your treatments. I would advise anyone who is staying to avail of booking treatments on line so you wont be disappointed in peak season. Also to book the Thalassotherapy area on line as you can get a reduction on the price for the 1hr use of this area. (This area has jet sprays, sauna & steam room facilities) Bring swim hat unless you would like to buy one with logo of Hotel for keep sake for €3. Like all Hotels. This Hotel has light entertainment in the evenings. It was enjoyable. You can also avail of the day tours. We used the Portitours excitement & adventure tours. Our guide Michael was a very humerous & extremely knowledge guy who made our day trip called the Wild West Coast very interesting & fun day out. Genuinely a nice person who loves his work, family & his heritage. 😊The Hotel is in a relatively quiet area so it might not suit every one. It isnt far from the main area of Restaurants & Bars if your interested in the night life. We enjoyed our cocktails & glasses of wine in the Hotel with the light musical entertainment in the evenings.  I hope everyone else who visits the Hotel enjoys their visit as much as we have. We shall be looking forward to returning to this Hotel in the future.  Regards Margaret Mary"
Jan 2017,40,"Great Hotel, shame about the 'Spa'...","A VERY nice Hotel, on a very nice beach, with lovely, well equipped apartments (separate from the hotel building itself) set on it's own away from the noise of the bars which are an easy stroll of about 10 minutes where you will also find a good Supermarket and all kinds of Restaurants, a further 7-8 minute walk and you are on the 'Strip'. A free Shuttle Bus runs 4 or 5 times a day to the top of the Strip and then to the 'Old Town', get there and drink in the sun on the Square and relax....(Then get a 'Tuk-Tuk from the top of the escalators, brilliant and well worth the money, will even take you back to the hotel for less than a taxi...)We had a lovely week, just returned today (Mid Jan), weather was really good in the day but cold after around 5pm when the sun is going down so be prepared!My ONLY gripe about the Hotel itself has been brought up before on T.A.....the 'Spa'.We booked a massage on arrival as we wanted a good old pamper, do nothing day. We booked the massage for 5.30pm with the idea of using the 'Spa' for a few hours before (begrudginly paying the extra 20 Euro each - hey, we were on holiday after all!) and just lazing around as we enjoy doing on weekend breaks in the U.K.We then found out that the Spa 'session' is ONLY FOR AN HOUR!!We duly cancelled our Sauna/pool plan AND the massage meaning they lost 130 Euro...the mind boggles....I must stress that this was our only whinge and a bit disappointed to say the least but the hotel, the staff, the accommodation,the location, Wonderful!"
Jan 2017,30,Spa review,We wanted to get away and spoil ourselves in the quiet season. Hotel itself was amazing but the spa let us down big time. We expected to have access to the spa when we paid top dollar for a massage each. About forty three euros each! Alas  we were told that we would have to pay extra to go into the spa. We duly booked a massage and called down in the morning to verify whether we could take water into the spa. Only to be told that we could only attend for one hour. It's twenty euro extra each per hour! Needless to say we ended up cancelling the whole lot as we were that disappointed. When booking to stay at this hotel just remember it might end up costing an arm and a leg for a day of pampering on top of the cost of the hotel!
Jan 2017,50,Deservedly five star,"Splendid accommodation, beach setting and staff attention.  We stayed in a self-catering studio: large bed, roomy kitchen diner and private balcony overlooking a small pool.  Although not resident in the hotel, service to us was impeccable with cosy dressing gowns, renewed toiletries and highly efficient daily maid service.  An excellent touch was the unexpected delivery of a cake and chilled sparkling wine on my birthday  Out of season so the two closest restaurants were closed, but nearby supermarket for self-catering was adequate and short taxi drive took us to excellent Portugese cuisine.  We would have welcomed sight of a menu for the hotel's fine dining restaurant but this remained unobtainable without entering the restaurant at a meal time."
Jan 2017,30,Mr kavanagh,Staff are lovely place is out of this world only bad things to say is rooms are very cold !! Swmming pool decking by the apartments aren't done properly as our 19 month daughter fell through it .... and the hotel just offered us milk and fruit as a sorry!!! This is not 5 star standard
Jan 2017,40,Lovely place,"Hotel is lovely and staff very nice, expect last morning leaving. The lady opened door for breakfast and demanded room number, was no good morning etc. Then refused to give my partner a take away cup for coffee but when pointed out this was given to other guests all week just shoved the cup in her hands. I reported to this to reception who apologied.Hotel is right on beach, rooms cleaned everyday. Burger restaurant in hotel was very tasty. Only one main hotel restaurant and the cafe bar on beach where open. Food value for money in those places weren't good. Hotel staff in general very friendly and always willing to help. Might return again April if I can get a good deal. Room was nice and seaview worth extra money but seemed our double bed was two single beds put together and sometimes when you lay in middle it was uncomfortable. All round was 9/10."
Jan 2017,30,"Scenic, but not a 5 star","Beautiful location, on beach view and a big resort. It is difficult to locate due a weak entrance display, it's a dark brown board with the name written in a dull bronze gold colour, you have to be really attentive to notice it. The staff is helpful, rooms are nice, but if you are visiting from uk please note that the rooms do not have a kettle, tea and coffee set. Only 1 bottle of water served for the entire stay. If you order tea it costs 4 euros for the tea and 5 euros for the room service, in total 9 euros for 1 cup of tea. The breakfast isn't immensely great, just basic English breakfast - sausages are small ones and bacon too thin and hard maybe due to being kept in freeze and reheated next day. Also some fruits and breads."
Jan 2017,50,Amazing hotel,"Very nice hotel and staff very friendly, only down thing it's a bit expensive to have a drink,e.g. magners was €7.50 other than that it was fab, so relaxing and the beach is beautiful beside the hotel, would defiantly stay here again."
Jan 2017,40,good,"Most of staff excellent. location and view unbeatable.bus service is good value.more lively night entertainment is needed such as dance shows, kids animation etc.More food variety in dinner  is neededoverall good value for money"
Jan 2017,50,Fantastic,Really good relaxing holiday would defantatly recommend too anyone and certainly use again . Apartment studios was fantastic and clean also location was perfect just far enough out of town for a  peaceful Holliday
Jan 2017,50,Fantastic location and facilities,"My wife and I spent six nights at this five star resort. We occupied a spacious studio suite, which was tastefully decorated. The kitchenette came in handy for making breakfast. There are several restaurants, and a grocery store within walking distance of the resort. The staff were very pleasant, and attentive. The hotel is located right on the beach, and is highly recommended. We did use the complimentary shuttle to the Old Town, even though we did have a rental vehicle."
Jan 2017,50,Brilliant atsmphore &,"Found this little hidden gem by chance, well deserved a visit. Very friendly and we'll facilities kid friendly. Really close to the beach. The gym & classes were excellent.staff went way & beyond to make sure your stay was comfortable & enjoyable. Can't praise the grandend real Santa Eul alia enough. I will definitely be  back. Thank you for making our stay & enjoyable and pleasurable one. See youse all again soon 🖒🖒"
Jan 2017,50,I'll be back,"Very happy to have stayed in this house-the stuff is very competitive and kind,the restaurants offer is amazing,space is very good looking and comfortable in the same time.The health area is pretty good too- easygoing space with kindful personal.The room was very good, beach view is so peaceful!Definitely we'll be back!"
Jan 2017,40,New year family holiday,"We decided we would go away for some winter sun for new year and what a fantastic hotel we picked. It's beautiful, the rooms are clean and very spaceous, cleaned everyday. The staff are very polite throughout the hotel and the food in the restaurant is excellent. The pool was heated so for the days that were cool so the children could still go in and the children's club was great, however it closed at 6pm so the children could become board in the evening due to lack of entertainment. Although the holiday overall was fantastic we found that the lack of entertainment was very poor, we knew that it would not be the same as peak season, but being new year we thought there would be more than there was. We went half board as we was under the assumption, after reading the hotel website, that we would have entertainment and an evening meal on new years eve, but due too poor communication over this, it only included the meal, in the same restaurant we went every evening and then they wanted €25 per hour for the children's club, which personally I think is too much, especially having 3 children. So therefore we had no entertainment and had to entertain the children. So new year's eve was ruined but that did not stop us from having a fabulous time. A family of 10 can make there own entertainment so we did not let it ruin the holiday.I would certainly like to return in peak season as I can imagine it's like a different place,  but we did love having the pool areas too ourselves. Also with the hotel being  situated on a beautiful clean beach we were able to stroll along it without the manic mayhem of tourists. I have loved my week in Portugal, we got the shuttle from the hotel too the old town and it was beautiful , we will certainly be returning one day."
Jan 2017,40,Real Santa Eulalia - good place to to make holidays,"A good place near the ocean, nice beach, full of nature, silence, far from traffic and stress, several places in the house, good place of the atlantic Café, but it is need to improvethe quality of bread, also bread with full corn, also red fish - in german it is called ""Lachs"", the breakfast-room is too small. The service people run and run an run, that makes nervous. Good: pain aux chocolat and pain aux raisins."
Jan 2017,40,Good place to relax with excellent breakfast buffet!,"We had a relaxing week in December 2016/NYE in this formidable area, prestine beaches and plenty of trekking along the nearby cliffs or in the backcountry. Ecxellent breakfast buffet and perfect sunset views from the beach side bar. Really friendly staff also! Nothing to complain about!"
Jan 2017,50,Excellent centrally located 5* hotel in Albufeira,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 days. Staff are very friendly. Breakfast buffet has plenty of hot and cold food & drink choices.  As it was winter time, the outdoor pools were cold and not much activities to do either. Free shuttle service for travelling to ""The strip"" (new town) and old town was a bonus. Beach was close and beautiful. Sea view room is an advantage to watch the sunrise and sunset and listen to the waves from the ocean."
Jan 2017,30,"Badly stained carpets in room, no kettle, no items in mini bar","Potential to be a great hotel, but the rooms need a make over, quite dated and the carpets are heavily stained around the mini bar and table areas, everything worked well in the rooms, though the engineer had to open the safe twice for us."
Jan 2017,50,Relaxing ,"Really enjoyed our stay here. It's nice atmosphere and friendly staff make it all worth while. There's so much to do, from the beaches to the tennis courts, you could never get bored here. Definitely recommend if visiting portugal."
Jan 2017,50,Five star standard with relaxed beach holiday atmosphere. Posh but not pretentious.,"Stayed in seafront suite. Highly recommend. Worth the extra price.  All the staff are so professional, approachable and friendly. Breakfast and dinner, delicious. Cafe at the front, recommend sparkling white sangria! Enjoyed it while watching the sunset."
Dec 2016,30,"Pretentious hotel, just a resort","1. Reminds me of all the All-Inclusives seen in Cancun and Carribeans, however, there is no dinner or lunch included. 2. I went in December, so the pool was not of much use to me. 3.  Views from sea-facing room are great. Don't know about other rooms. 4.  You can use the iron for 1-2 hours.  If you wish to keep it in your room you pay 5 euros every day. 5.  This greediness bothered me. They won't even give you a free tea bag.  You have to pay for it. 6. Carpets inside my room had a musty odor. In this day and age carpets are old fashioned and unhygienic.  Owners please change to wooden or some other type of floor.  The carpets in the corridors depict waves and are quite tacky. 7.  The staff can be hit or miss. Some are happy and willing to please. Others are grouchy. 8.  If you want to see the beautiful Algarve coast, don't forget to rent a car. Best place to rent it is in Faro airport. 9.  In my opinion, visiting the Algarve coast should be the highest point of your stay in Albufeira.  It has an amazing natural beauty not just a beach for sunbathing.  The hotel and pool are merely commercial things which pale in comparison to Benagil beaches."
Dec 2016,50,Amazing Hotel ,"I simply cannot fault the hotel itself; the location of it is perfect, calm and relaxing. The staff are very friendly and treat you like royalty! There aren't many facilities apart from a few outdoor pools, an indoor pool and a tennis court... to use the indoor pool costs 20 euros for an hour which is a little pricey but that's to be expected. Lovely apartments too! Would definitely stay again!"
Dec 2016,40,"great location, slightly dated facilities","We stayed here for 2 nights in early October when the weather was really nice, so the quick access to the beach is a real bonus. The hotel itself is part of a larger resort with friendly staff and adequate rooms, but the whole setup looks like it could do with a bit of a remodeling. There are other resorts in the area that can lay a better claim to 5-stars."
Dec 2016,50,short break,Birthday treat for hubby - excellent hotel - fabulous seaview from the balcony - service was second to n one for the whole stay - down side it was a bit in the sticks quite a long walk to the local shops.
Dec 2016,40,Christmas 2005,"This hotel is nicely located in a small beach. Very modern, the rooms are big comfortable. Nice staff, the Spa is very good, as a nice bar and the restaurant as excellent food. Definitely a   place to be back."
Dec 2016,40,Fantastic resort,"We stayed here for 4 nights in a studio apartment. The rooms was bathroom was clean and tidy with nice interiors. It is a very big property with sufficient parking space. The resort offers free shuttle service to visit new and old town, though we had a car so we didn't take.The check-in was quick and the guy at reception explains everything clearly and in detail. They have golf car to drop you to your apartment from the reception.Overall, it was nice relaxing experience and a good value-for-money."
Nov 2016,50,"Fantastic Hotel, Apartments and Resort","My wife and I spent our 32nd wedding anniversary here 5-10 November.  The management and staff were amazing and couldn't have been nicer.  The Manager Jorge Teixeira dealt with an issue with had brilliantly and we had a taste of both the apartments and the hotel.  Both were well presented and well equipped.  The beach is small but lovely and is virtually private for the guests.  This was our first time in Portugal and we would definitely goback.  The food in the hotel can be pricey, but this is a 5 star hotel and there are restaurants in the town about 5 minutes drive away, where you can eat all your meals should you wish and there are supermarkets within 10 minutes walk."
Nov 2016,50,Winter break,"Had three days in Grand Real and it didn't disappoint, rooms were great , spaciousclean and tidy, bath robes provided, Sea View was so worth it, Hotel is so lovely plenty of space everywhere, fabulous roof terraces for dining and sunning yourself. private gate down to beach, and a lovely snack bar available there so it was lovely to have a drink and look out to sea. Breakfast was amazing all you could think off, champagne, orange juice eggs cooked to suit your taste, cereals , yogurts, fruits, cheeses cold meats, all types of breaks and cakes, went out to dinner so not sure whats on offer, Also had a pedicure while there and friends has massages so we totally enjoyed the stay , it was to short. we were fortunate to have had three Sunny days in November .all the staff were so nice from reception to bar to waiters . Well done Grand Real."
Nov 2016,40,RELAXING FRIENDLY HOTEL,"This is a lovely hotel staff very friendly & helpful, especially at reception desk. This is my second time hear & hopefully won't be my last. If there is one thing I would have an issue wit is wine at dinner is very over priced. Other than that  great."
Nov 2016,30,Grande Real,I arrived late in the evening and the reception staff were very friendly and efficient. The rooms were spacious but a bit dated.Bar and restaurant staff were also very friendly.I didn't like the breakfast. I would stay here again.Scott
Nov 2016,50,Magnificent hotel and staff,"We booked the hotel ,we had never been to Portugal ,This hotel is in the most beautiful position ,over looking a gorgeous beach ,with twinkling sea ,as the sun shimmers on the surface .The interior of the lobby reception and bar area ,are classical and relaxing ,with fantastic views .The rooms are spacious with comfy beds lovely bedding ,free safe free remote tv ,hair dryer fridge ,clean towels everyday and dressing gown.The staff in reception ,bar ,restaurant , domestic ,chef ,everyone ,work so hard ,and make you feel special ,and pampered ,they are all truly fabulous .We loved it so much we have just booked again .Cannot wait to return ,so peaceful and romantic ,just lovely ."
Nov 2016,40,Wonderful hotel,Great hotel.  I really recommend getting a room with a sea view balcony.The weather in the Algarve in November is amazing.Zero rating for Jet2 Holidays though:Had to return home for a family emergency.Jet2 showed zero compassion or humanity.  Thank you Amanda.....
Nov 2016,40,Lovely hotel,"Very nice hotel by the sea and near Albufeira (free shuttle to go there: 5 times a day during low season isn't enough...). Ensure you book a sea-view room for the beautiful scenery. Very comfortable beds, the bathroom is big, the staff was very professional and friendly. You can borrow many toys and a stroller for your children free of charge (the stroller was waiting for us in our room); the buffet breakfast is just awesome. The only negative point is that in my opinion the 5 star-rating is incorrect as the hotel does not have an indoor swimming pool."
Nov 2016,50,Fantastic hotel,"If anyone is looking for a hotel in  alberfura then look no further ,not only is it set in a lovely area .but it is a fantastic hotel ,the staff could not do enough for everyone ,polite ,friendly ,always there to help .The rooms are spacious and are cleaned every day ,the food you will find an amazing variety, there is some thing for all."
Nov 2016,50,Amazing break,"Stayed here for 4nights beginning of November , from the moment we checked in until we departed the service was second to none. Could not do enough for you. Reception staff very informative, reception large and airy plenty of sofas to relax. Rooms very spacious , large bathroom , cleaned daily. Ordered room service(available 24 hours) twice throughout our stay, very prompt service, food great and plentiful. Breakfast in main restaurant good however didn't opt to visit at lunchtimes don't think the main buffet lunch was worth 30euros per person, only a selection of main courses available. (Stayed on a b&b basis) Grounds well kept and terrific views over sea. Very relaxed atmosphere however as we were travelling with 8month old baby this was ideal. Entertainment on evening very low key but didn't expect any animation team due to the type of hotel.   A little out of Albuferia centre, however regular courtesy bus available. Treat myself to a massage and manicure (appeared to have monthly special offers) felt totally relaxed, amazing spa facilities. Overall a relaxing experience 5star luxury."
Nov 2016,50,The Hotel is Fabulous,"I have just spent 4 days at the Hotel, it was a faboulous break for me and my partner, We had a sea View room with lovely views of the secluded beach which belongs to the hotel. The Hotel is  5 star clean fresh with lovely interior throughout. the Staff are one of the best I have come across very approachable well mannered and can't do enough for you.  The only problem I found was the breakfast was on the warm/cold side. Presented well with plenty of choice to choose from. would highly recommend this Hotel has a top 5 star tranquil hotel set in lovely surroundings with very assertive staff who can't do enough for you. 👍😊✈️"
Nov 2016,50,just spent a week in this hotel,"A wonderful hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Especially the reception staff. The breakfast and evening dinner were great. The food, the presentation and selection of food was vast and the quality superb. The rooms were a bit dated but were kept , in perfect condition and the addition of a chocolate on the pillow at night lended a lovely touch. While there was a wonderful Spa, I thought it was a bit overpriced, that is to say a charge of Euro20 per visit was a little too much for my pocket. Also having arthritis in both hips and knees, the outdoor pool did not have a handrail to help one in and out of the pool. but the patio and view was spectacular. Had a wonderful week and would definitely consider returning."
Nov 2016,50,Beautiful Hotel and beautiful country,One of the best hotels we have stayed in. Lovely  wide entrance and a great warm welcome from the staff  Our room was spacious and light and the beds were firm and comfortable It was also quiet and that made for a good night's sleep. Breakfast was first rate with lots of choice including local fruit .At dinner the starters were very well prepared and there was excellent choice and the sweets were to die for! The main course was a bit repetitive and when there were some extra choices like pork ribs and sardines they were soon gone and not replaced. I felt main courses were a bit boring.  However the food was really very good. Happy hour at the bar is well worth catching as drinks are half price. The hotel is spotlessly clean and I felt very comfortable there.  I shall return !
Nov 2016,50,Great Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel ( as a couple) from 4th to 11th November.  It’s classed as a five star hotel.   I’d say more of a 4 star.  You enter the Resort through security gates.  On arrival I didn’t think the hotel looked very impressive.  The foyer is the usual hotel reception area.  The check in was quick and efficient.  We booked B&B plus dinner.  The rooms were very big, lovely big bed and lots of pillows and most important really snow white fluffy towels.  The rooms were cleaned every day.  The staff was very attentive and there was plenty of staff on duty during our stay.  The outside areas were very well maintained.  The restaurant was nice, plenty of staff around.  The meals were buffet style.  Breakfast was good with the food always hot.  It was the usual fare but always nicely presented and enjoyable to eat.  Dinner was acceptable- not 5 star quality but none the less we never went hungry.  There were plenty of beds around the pools (as you would expect during November).  There is a snack bar (The Atlantico I think it’s called). It’s very close to the beach and really it had a gorgeous view of the ocean.  The food there was great.  To have lunch and sit there with a glass of wine was heaven.  The hotel has its own beach which is accessed by a gate using your room key.  It’s  a small sandy beach which is lovely.  The evening entertainment was not great. The hotel is in an area where there is little to do and hotel realises this and provide a free shuttle bus several times a day in to Albufeira.  The hotel is about 40 minutes’ drive from Faro Airport.  I would return to this hotel."
Nov 2016,50,Fantastic,Just returned from 10 nights had a fantastic time..Went self /catering but paid for breakfast 250 Euros yes it is a lot but is worth  every penny. apartment was great and cleaned to the highest standard .all staff were polite and professional 'On my birthday a waiter came to the apartment with the good wishes of all the staff a cake and bottle of wine' thanks on behalf of my wife and myself'
Nov 2016,40,mademachen,We stayed at Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort for a few days. We appreciated a lot the kindness of staff. The food was good. Pools were chilly at this period. Not many activities to do except that the beach is very close and beautiful and we could enjoy it. We found the family room comfortable and clean... but noisy. Soundproofing is not amazing. We had the bad luck to stay during a sport championship and the teams have celebrated a lot!
Nov 2016,50,Amazing,The hotel was outstanding from the moment we arrived. We arrived around 10:30pm and the check in was some easy. We were also able to avail of food from the restaurant which was amazing and service was quick and smart. Rooms were cleaned every day. Facilities were nothing more then amazing. I couldn't recommend this hotel more should easily be 6stars
Nov 2016,50,WKC championships,Great hotel & complex was my first time here and will be back really enjoyed my stay looking forward to my next stay here. The pool area was great for the kids as there was a choice of three pools and also had a nice beach to walk along
Nov 2016,10,House keeping kept intruding even with a do not disturb sign,"I stayed for 2 nights, I had requested a double bed for an 11 month old and an adult,  I was told that it was possible it could be two singles made as a double, I agreed and stated I didn't not need a cot as the baby would sleep in the bed with the adult, what I got was two singles made up as two singles and a cot,I put up a do not disturb sign, on the first morning housekeeping made up the room when I was out, I asked about it and was told the sign was on the floor so they did not see it, On the second morning checkout was 12, house keeping knocked at 11 although I had left a do not disturb sign,If it wasn't for house keeping I would have rated this hotel as greatAlso I got 3 emails so far asking me to leave a review!"
Nov 2016,50,Grande Real,Lovely hotel.  We stayed here for 5 nights in 2 bedroom apartment.  Room was spotless and cleaned daily.  Pools located all around the hotel.  Breakfast had a good variety to choose from.  Lovely gated beach that again was spotless.
Nov 2016,50,My stay,"Stayed for the last weekend in October for a family wedding. It was such a great hotel. Everything was great from the room, to the pool to the beach. The service at the wedding itself was amazing. The staff were excellent the whole weekend."
Nov 2016,40,Not really sure it was 5 star,Hotel was nice for was good but very expensive drinks extremely expensive. The pools were good but would of been better if both were heated as kids could only go in one as other was freezing. The staff were great very attentive cleaner needs to change beds more often but down to preference. Over all lovely stay would go back happily
Nov 2016,50,Perfect holidays!,"The view from our room over the beach and the water was great. The seaview room and the balcony is big and well furnished The ocean is always to hear. The plants around the hotel are excotic.The    meals are excelent, every day different, varied and typical portugues. The stuff is well educated and very friendly."
Nov 2016,50,Stay NOWHERE else in Albufeira!!!!,"From The moment you pull up along the cobbled drive, you get a feeling that it is going to be a special place. The 'grand' title lives up to its billing, it simply does not disappoint. Make sure you take advantage of the private beach, the free bus ride into town (for a drink or several) but don't be late for breakfast - it can get a little busy in the last 20 minutes. My Girl and I had a magical week at the Grand & we are already planning a return!"
Nov 2016,50,"Beautiful hotel, lovely pools, nice beach",We stayed here as my daughter was competing in the WKC World Championships. The hotel lives up to its name and has a prime position on the coastline with beautiful views of the beach. Room was clean and a decent size with a nice wide balcony. Breakfast was amazing with everything you could want and more. Free bus to/from the old and new towns was great. All staff are very friendly and speak good English. The private beach has a decent amount of soft sand even at full tide.
Nov 2016,40,Feedback,"Overall, great location. Disappointed that had to pay additional for indoor pool and outdoor pools were very small. Bar and restaurant also expensive and restaurant menu choice was very limited. Good bus service to the town though."
Nov 2016,50,Excellent hotel,The hotel was amazing.  The staff were very helpful.  The facilities were appropriate for all ages.  We stayed for breakfast.   The only downside was the breakfast.  But other than that an excellent hotel.  It's on the beach.  But you do need transport to go to town.  But the hotel do put a free bus on.
Nov 2016,50,Stunning Resort- Pictures don't do it justice,"We stayed there and booked 2 Apartments both conveniently located next to each other. First impression driving into the resort was Wow! The lobby stunning! Although lacks that buzz but nonetheless a chilled out lobby. staff outstanding helpful top class service there on hand to help out where possible. Shuttle service in November every 2 hours to the new town/strip/old townAlthough you can walk to the New Town pretty comfortably.The rooms were spacious the beds were little on the hard side for me. The duvet was a blanket wedged in between bed sheets which cause me too itch one night like mad! But the bedroom was big well equipped.Kitchen area had a bed and a double sofa bed again nice and spacious. Kitchen well equipped. Bathroom was ideal with doors in between rooms for privacy. One complimentary bottle of water was a bit of a bummer, as it should be provided on a daily basis as a basic but it's just a inconvenience to go shopping. Special mention to the housekeepers friendly on hand to help! And not wake you up to early Sitting area outside is pretty cool,  but eating food there can be a nightmare as the birds will attack haha.. Wifi all across the resort good connection too. Couple of swimming pools, pricey restaurant. Access to the beach from the hotel stunning views from the other side of the lobby! Just blue oceans. Decent spa although iv seen better and less expensive ones in other countries.Taxis are not really that pricey €3.60 then €1 every mile after and then €1 when it stopsTaxi drivers hand out the contact cards so directly to that taxi which is pretty good if you don't speak the local language. Would I stay there again yes!"
Nov 2016,50,Just lovely,"Arrived for the World Karate and Kickboxing Championship, it was very busy, but very well organised having the competitors check in at a table away from the reception desk. The rooms were lovely, the sea view was stunning (room 201) . Plenty of sun-beds around the pools which was of a good size and easy to get in . I'm disabled and use a wheelchair most of the time , the staff couldn't do enough for me . Breakfast was plenty and delicious but the evening meal was a little disappointing, not much to choose from, what was there was tasty though. I would of liked to of gone out with my family and friends but the path and roads in the hotel grounds are cobbled and very uncomfortable for a wheelchair user. We asked for a late check out as we had an evening flight, we could have the room for free up until 2pm but that wasn't long enough for me, so we opted to pay €47 to have the room till 6pm. We all had a lovely time and will return...........next time I will ask the staff to take me to the gate in one of their buggies so I can see a bit of lovely Portugal. Thank you to all the staff."
Nov 2016,50,Beautiful Hotel,"Just come back from a week stay. Loved our whole time there. Room size was a little smaller than expected for a twin room, however it was clean, with comfortable furniture and good house keeping.The staff we met in the main hotel and restaurant for breakfast were all very polite and friendly and always happy with help. There was also a good range of food for breakfast. The hotel has private access to a beautiful beach and it wasn't busy during this time, which was perfect for us. The only litte niggles for us was there was no tea/coffee making facilities in our room, and the water bottle was not refilled/replaced and nor was there an iron or ironing board and had to pay an extra €5 per 24 hours for this. On the whole, I would still definitely return and stay there again."
Nov 2016,50,I would thoroughly recommend this Hotel Resort,"Wonderful holiday end October beginning November 2016. The staff at this lovely hotel were polite, warm and welcoming. Joao Climaco was particularly helpful to us. I am a widow and travelled with my 9 year old daughter. We wanted to spend most of our time in the pools. I loved the salt water pool and I swam there every day and my skin loved it! My daughter had hours of fun in the heated pool. The breakfast buffet at this hotel is outstanding, anything you could wish for is there. The freshly squeezed juice and fresh fruit bursting with sunshine was such a great way to begin each day. We stayed in a hotel garden sea view room which was central to everything. We could transport wet things from the pool to our little garden without going through the hotel building and it was very convenient to get to the Atlantico Restaurant where we ate four times this week. We walked around and enjoyed walks on the clean beach and we checked out all 7 pools. We will definitely return. Very romantic setting for couples."
Nov 2016,30,Good access to beach but not clean,"The front desk was efficient and helpful when we checked in.The hotel is located close to the beach, but is accessed by several steps and hard to negotiate if mobility is an issue. They also have a pool which is easily accessed.This hotel appears to cater to families with children as there are many posted activities for children as well as a play area for them.Outside of the public areas though, the hotel looks old and shabby. Definitely needs upgrading.Our room was large enough and had a nice balcony facing the ocean ( For 10e more per night ). It was very outdated though. And unfortunately, was not as clean as it should be.  There was crusts of bread behind the furniture etc. When we checked out, we politely told the clerk at the front desk about some of our cleanliness concerns, she completely ignored them. We were sent an email by this hotel to rate our stay. When we addressed the cleaning issues, they again ignored what we said, and thanked us for our review."
Nov 2016,50,Hard to fault!,"Booked this hotel independently as part of a 2-centre Portugal holiday and enjoyed every minute!  It's a super hotel in a stunning location right on the beach. We visited at the end if the season and not all the restaurants and facilities were open/available but we got the hotel for a good price so we forgive them that!We stayed in a sea-view suite, comprising two large rooms interconnecting but with their own individual bathrooms and balconies. Rooms were serviced daily to a high standard and quality toiletries replenished along with a chocolate each daily!  Lovely to wake and listen to the waves on the beach. Yes drinks and food are certainly not cheap but neither are they excessive and there is a 2 hour happy hour daily from 5-7pm.  Breakfast was included on our deal and OK, not brilliant but a good choice and a nice atmosphere.  If anything we really missed an evening restaurant where we could be served as we are not big fans of buffet service meals!!  There are two restaurants on site that offer thus but both were closed for the winter.  Most local restaurants and bars now closing for either but a plethora to choose from in Albufuera or Olhos do Agua.  TIP try using UBER taxis as they are reliable and cheap!The pools are brilliant and one is heated too so we couldn't keep our daughter out!Regular free bus to and from town is complementary but on return we had to get a taxi as it was full :-(Reception, porter, pool and breakfast staff were all great but sonetimes the bar and beach bar service was slow but probably more to do with a lack of staff than anything else.Will be booking again for same time next year and it's not often we say that!"
Nov 2016,50,A FANTASTIC VENUE ,Having just returned from a World Karate Championships hosted at this stunning hotel I cannot say enough in praise of it.The facilities are excellent and the staff are first rate.This is the 3 rd year running this event has been held here and it never disappoints any of the 700 plus competitors and spectators.The rooms are sumptuous and the suites stunning. Even better for families are the villas that are spacious and light.The breakfast is plentiful with something to suit every taste.Old Town Albufiera a few minutes away is a must and is simply a delight to visit.Highly recommended and so worth visiting .
Nov 2016,40,Summer Holiday,"Very good ""Resort"" Hotel, with 2 minutes walking to the beach.I believe should have more chairs to customers in the beach.Ideal to family and children with two main pools.The price Vs accomodation is the best relation that we can find in the summer in august."
Nov 2016,50,Lovley holiday,"We stayed a week there in a hotel apartment and it was great. It is also almost the only hotel, which is located on the beach side and has a beach access.The service is very nice and the area around the hotel is nice. U can also find alot of restaurants around."
Nov 2016,30,Not really a five star hotel anymore,"We visited Albufeira in October and stayed in this hotel for six nights. The hotel is located in a very good location close to new town, local supermarkets and few nice restaurants such as Martina where is located just few minutes walk from the hotel and served good sea food and grill.  The walk to the beach was very pleasant as you walk through nice paths serenaded by beautiful plants and trees, just avoid the restaurant (not part of the hotel) on your way to the beach. They served cheap frozen food (Pizza, and etc) to high prices. The smaller swimming pool was heated to ca. 24C so it was crowded with children. The breakfast was nice and staff were very friendly and you had lot of choices if you were on diet or preferred to have healthy diet. We did not use the SPA as the price was very expensive. The sea view form our room was just unbelievable and beautiful and had a good size balcony. However the rooms needed to be refurbished and indeed should have been refurbished long time ago. The carpets and curtains were so dirty and  tired that you would not touch them. The bathroom was cleaned but needed to be refurbished as well. The were no walking in shower and we had to stand in the old bathtub to shower. I believe most of the four or five star hotels have walking in showers this days. The worst was that we did not have any ventilation in our bathroom and when we complained we were told that the ventilation would be switched on by the hotel few hours per day? We have never seen that it would work. The rooms did not offer any tea or coffee facilities and all you could find were four glass look like plastic mugs (Two in the bathroom and two on the bedside table). This hotel could retains it's reputation and missing two stars if they start to refurbishing it. On our last day the hotel lobby, lifts and breakfast restaurant were very busy as the hotel hosted the world kick boxing championship."
Oct 2016,50,Outstanding Dining & Catering Experience,"llendOur oldest son and his fiance wanted a ""destination"" wedding, and they chose Albufeira, Portugal.Never having been there, that presented the challenge for me to find and book a location for a Rehearsal Dinner for 40p ""online"".We wanted a beach-side / beachfront setting and so I started Googling to get information.The catering staff at Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort proved to be the most helpful and most responsive of all the inquiries I made. And the pictures of the resort were fabulous.Over the course of several months, we tied down the details. And much to the delight of all the family that traveled to Portugal, our beachside reception and dinner truly could not have been more perfect.The setting on the patio of the Santa Eulalia restaurant was ideal to start the evening and enjoy  the Algarve coast sunset.We dined inside the restaurant for dinner....but the window wall of the restaurant was open so we felt like we were still outside.The food and service were among the best I have ever experienced, and I spent 30-years in the hotel business and am not easily impressed.The plate presentation was outstanding, the flavors excellent, and all this was complemented by wonderfully attentive service from the staff.In short...it was perfect evening."
Oct 2016,40,Beautifully kept and lots of amenities ,"We stayed here with our 2 children and had a lovely week at this hotel. Food was lovely as were the grounds and rooms. Everything is spotlessly maintained and to a very good standard as you would expect from a 5 star hotel. The kids club is lovely to take your children along too and play and the football nets in the gardens proved a real hit with the children too. The tennis courts are abit shoddy and they charge 10€ to play which I thought is abit excessive & should be free. All the rooms have lovely views and there is plenty on the grounds to keep everyone busy. They have 1 heated outdoor pool which gets very busy as the others are very cold, it would be great if they could heat a couple of pools to give the children abit more space to play as they are fairly small pools."
Oct 2016,50,Splendid setting,Just back from a week half board in this hotel on the Algarve. Went with Jet2.com and after a great flight we had just a 1 hour transfer to the resort. We had booked an apartment and was pleased we had as it give us great room and facilities.The apartments are only two story high and are split into 2 areas each with its own adult and child pool.At the main hotel there are another 3 pools one of which is seawater.The hotel is really well situated with only a short walk to the beach which is always most private.We were on a half board basis and you had the option to eat at lunch time or in the evening. The big drawback is that it is the same menu each day at lunch time so we only ate there on 2 days. The dinner menu was much better but the general layout of the buffet servary was very congested and did not show off what was on offer but that said the food was overall good. Only thing I dislike is that when I pay for half board I should not have to pay 4 euro each time for a bottle of water.There is a good free bus service to Albufeira which is an added bonus. Very laid back and relaxing hotel and certainly no noise at Nite time.
Oct 2016,40,Relaxing hotel in lovely surroundings,"Just returned from a week's stay in an apartment at this resort. A lovely quiet hotel and resort with a stunning private beach you access using your room key. The apartment was spacious, well appointed and cleaned daily - a lovely home from home, the only downside being the extremely firm bed and that you could hear every movement from the apartment above (if you're on a ground floor of course). The website says there are five pools, which indeed there are, but in reality only one small one is used - the only heated one which is nearest the hotel. Kids loved it though, and there were lots of families from all nationalities, all very friendly (no riff-raff!). Visiting in low season (just before October half term) there was always plenty of spare sun loungers around the pool, which was great.As we booked self-catering, we ate lunch in our apartment and either caught the courtesy bus into the Old Town in the evening (6.20pm last pick-up, and had to get taxi back at night, but this was only around 8Euro), or ate at the lovely Portobello Italian restaurant over the road (highly recommended). We stocked up on food for the apartment at the Super Mercado just down the road (turn right out of the hotel and walk a couple of hundred yards, past the first hotel-run market, and to the one that's just after the Balia golf resort). We also ordered room service on our last day as it was horrendous weather and this was brought to the room by a lovely chap within 45 minutes and was good value. We didn't eat in the hotel's restaurants at all, so can't comment on those. We caught the service bus to Vilamoura Marina one day - the hotel reception will happily provide a timetable and the bus stop is just outside the hotel entrance on the left. This was a nice change, but only restaurants, shops and yachts to see! Hotel and resort is very quiet with not much going on, but that suited us. Kids club was running, didn't look like it was used much though and activities catered more for younger children so our daughter who is aged 10 didn't try it. There's also a small playground and tennis courts, and a volleyball court and some mini-football posts near the apartments. On Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights there were some lovely acoustic singers in the hotel bar which were great to kick-back on the sofas and listen to with an Algarve Splash cocktail!All in all, it was great - I'm not sure it warrants the full 5 stars, but certainly lovely surroundings and friendly staff.The hotel is around a 35 minute journey by car from Faro airport - we pre-booked with Sunlife Transfers (60Euro return trip for family of three). Very punctual and friendly driver."
Oct 2016,50,Excellent - we loved this hotel ,"My wife and I have just returned home after 4 nights at this hotel. We booked a sea view room which had amazing views of the sea and beach. The room was a great size and the bed was massive and comfortable. We booked bed and breakfast. Breakfast has the usual 5 star variety ranging from a cooked English to pastry and cold meats etc....the options are too many to list. The breakfast is excellent. The hotel is a short taxi ride to the old town of Albufeira (about 8 euros). The hotel also provides a bus service to the old and new town, if you don't mind sharing and sticking to pick up and drop off times.We loved the hotel and the old town. We'd definitely come back.The hotel staff couldn't do enough to help. They are fast to deal with any issues and do their utmost to make you feel welcome. There are 2 snack bars nearby with views of the beach. The food again is great and very reasonably priced.We would definitely recommend this hotel."
Oct 2016,40,Room never cleaned satisfactorily,This a review of 'good' and 'bad'.  The major deficit was that our room was never cleaned satisfactorily during the seven nights that we stayed there.  The carpet was badly stained when we moved in.  Cleaning was perfunctory and variable.  Glasses not washed; towels not replaced (i.e. removed) and many more deficits.  When I checked out the person to whom I spoke admitted 'housekeeping is our weak link but we are addressing it'.  The public areas were spotless - highlighting the deficiencies in room housekeeping. The location is idyllic (although it might not be so good if one did not have a hire car).  Sophie - 'breakfast greeter' - is probably the best example of excellence in hotel staff that one could meet.  The person who 'checked us in' could certainly learn from her.  It would be hard to say that - owing to the major housekeeping deficiencies - this hotel merits five stars.  I am not convinced that the deficiencies in this respect did not merit more than a verbal apology.  Noise at night seemed to depend upon whether or not parents were able to keep their children quiet.  A river bed was being repaired/upgraded close to the hotel and the 'digger noise' started promptly at 8am (except Sunday).
Oct 2016,50,Above and Beyond Expectations,"We visited this hotel in August 2016 and from the moment we arrived until the moment we left, we were treated with overwhelming kindness. Whilst here it was my mum's birthday but they did not know this. However we returned to our room after a day out to find a huge table filled with champagne in an ice bucket, plates, knives and the most beautiful birthday cake, candles too with a lighter to light them. A birthday message completed the surprise, very thoughtful.The Hotel has very helpful, approachable staff, is spacious, well presented, every area clean and beautifully furnished. With excellent facilities for all ages, not to mention the spar and fabulous location just outside Albufeira I would highly recommend The Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and Hotel Spa."
Oct 2016,40,"Great Staff, nice hotel and facilities but overpriced!","I visited this hotel with family and two small kids in October and the welcoming staff were fantastic, professional and friendly. Facilities were great, pool, kids club, beach. Room was nice, we stayed in the apartments. Decor was very colourful as you can see in the pictures, even though it was not my taste, I could live with it. Cleaning was done daily and nicely. Flushing toilet was slightly malfunctioning as it took forever to fill up with water. Everything else was okay.However I found some of the guests a bit odd as they were always staring at us at breakfast and dinner (we are a black family). Hubby ended up buying food from the shop and eating in the room regardless of the fact that we had paid for dinner just because he didn't feel comfortable with the constant stares. Not the hotel's fault though. And finally, you are charged for drinks even when on half board and it is quite pricey."
Oct 2016,40,Lovely clean resort,"We visited here in mid October. Weather was lovely and warm and sunny for the most part. Large spacious rooms and bathroom. Nice modern decoration. All very clean. Beds were comfy though they squeaked a lot whenever you moved.We had a balcony with a sea view which was worth upgrading for. Especially to watch and hear the sea whilst lying in bed!There was only one bottle of water in the room- no other refreshments. That bottle wasn't even replaced once we drank it on the first day so lack of drink in the room was a negative for us. We'd have loved some tea and coffee as well. Lovely large hotel. Plenty of restaurants and bars though no where to eat between the hrs of about 5:30 and 7. Lots of choice at breakfast. Lots of pools, terraces to sunbathe, lovely private beach. Small gift shop in the hotel.Activities and kids clubs available during the day but very little or no entertainment at night but I guess that's because we are close to the end of the summer season. We stayed for 4 days which was enough. I'd recommend this resort for anyone wanting a relaxing break away."
Oct 2016,50,Wonderful,"Wonderful hotel, service was great. Super facilities, highly recommend the spa. Beautiful views and brilliant beach and pool. The food was of a very high standard and a great variety to suit all tastes.  Free wifi which was great especially around the pool"
Oct 2016,40,nice and quiet and out of the way,"This hotel has a very nice spacious setting with lovely grounds and close access to a beach - which is a small cove with life guards. The pool was very warm for this time of year and the area well serviced with loungers. Its not near the Strip or Old Town so a taxi costs circa 8 - 10 Euros, but the hotel does provide a minibus free of charge at various times of the day - we used both with ease.  Cleanliness of our room was spot on, staff very helpful and approachable and there's nothing to fault there, or indeed selection of food for breakfast. The only downside was the lack of a restaurant with waiter/waitress service in the evening -  they have one but it only sells 'burgers' - chicken, veal or fish (Im not talking one of the chains, far superior, but burgers nonetheless. The other restaurant for evening meals is a buffet 'serve yourself. would I return if travelling back to the area - yes without doubt :)"
Oct 2016,30,"Nice beach, nice apartments, poor food and not great valule","The bottom line is that it's got a great beach and it's a nice hotel, but isn't great value or quality for a 5* hotel compared to others we have stayed at. The apartments are perfectly spacious and nice. Cleaned well every day and staff were generally nice and helpful throughout. The pools are simple small round affairs of which only 1 by the hotel is heated. You'd expect more from a 5* hotel. There is an indoor luxury spa pool (adults only) at a charge of 30 euros. I feel that this should be included. Likewise, the sauna and rest of the spa is all expensively priced individually. We visited in October when it wasn't at its busiest but weather was perfect for us. I can imagine the sun loungers disappearing very quickly in the height of summer. The bar, entertainment and atmosphere in the evening was pretty ""dry""  - perhaps just the time of the year. But there is a nice terrace to enjoy a peaceful drink and sunset sea view. For kids there is a simple playground and kids club house with toys, games, tv etc. This is good but it's not really a family hotel I'd say.Don't eat here in the evenings. The breakfast buffet is okay but the evening one was pretty poor quality/choice and VERY expensive. Spent 32 euros EACH trying the evening buffet once. It felt like a bright busy canteen, atmosphere was hectic and uncomfortable. Didn't really enjoy the food although we ate a lot to get our moneys worth. You can get a much better meal and atmosphere for half the price across the road at ""portabellos"" itallian resaurant. Eat out, although you will have to drive or walk quite far. There is a lovely beach on your doorstep and the hotel is generally good as you would expect from it's 5* rating. I give it only 3* when rated at this price point and when compared to other 5* hotels. Its location on the beach is its saving grace."
Oct 2016,50,Simply wonderful,We stayed in the Grand Real in the first week of October. We were a group of over 700 country music fans. Now when such a large group is booked in to a hotel one would expect corners to be cut. Not on this occasion and not in this hotel. Everything was as it should be in a five star hotel. It is a beautiful hotel and although it was very busy and crowded standards were of the highest standards. Staff were excellent and helpful in every way. We stayed in the hotel but the complex has a large number of apartments. The only gripe I would have being Irish was that there was no tea making facilities in the room but that was very minor.I think that this Hotel would be a great destination for a long relaxing break and a great plus is the fact that a beautiful beach is only a very very short walk away..
Oct 2016,50,nice and quiet,"All you expect from a 5 stars hotel and more. the place if self contained if you want to rest and don't want to go out on bus (private of the hotel) to meet the crowd. several restaurants with excellent food, not the usual hotel food, prices of course are in line with a 5 star. several swimming pools and a large space, if you prefer the beach is just a few steps away. worth every cent. surrounded by pine trees and the sea you can f a quiet tea before bed or a drink if you prefer. just outside the hotel, by the beach you have a few restaurants but go to the beach at night and have fresh fish at ""The Pescador"" (not part of the hotel)"
Oct 2016,50,Well earn't break- above & beyond our expectations! ,"What can I say about this resort?!  I have no idea where to start.  FANTASTIC!  The place is beautiful!  Great rooms, facilities, staff & food.  The beach is exquisite (& I'm no beach fan, preferring a pool) & the pools ,although a little on the cold side, are stunning with comfortable sun loungers that are plentiful.  The views from the terrace are spectacular.  We had an amazing time & even with a slight hiccup were astounded by the way we were catered for. The management especially went out of their way to accommodate our every need & went above & beyond our expectations.  We are so looking forward to returning for our honeymoon in 2018! Huge thanks to everyone, we will see you again."
Oct 2016,20,Wedding bliss turned soar ,When we first visited this hotel in 2014 we fell in love with it and knew it was the venue for our wedding. We got married on 26 September 2016 and the day went perfect. All our guests had nothing but good things to say and plenty commented that they planned to return at a future date. My husband and I along with our toddler went back today to collect some belongings of the wedding and to enjoy the hotel one last time before we returned to Ireland. We had breakfast and lunch at the hotel today while reminiscing about our perfect day. We were already planning our trip back in November minus our daughter to have a mini moon baby free when our daughter accidentally bumped her lip and started crying. Neither myself nor my husband could console her so I took her outside. When I arrived back into the hotel the lady Assistant Manager was over talking to my husband and advised us that the hotel was exclusive to a tour from Ireland effectively asking us to leave. We had earlier been talking with other non tour guests In fact praising the hotel and venue about our wedding. We had found this very disappointing since we had spent a lot of money the week prior. We had planned on returning to this venue annually for our anniversary but this has left a soar taste in our mouths. I was genuinely upset after this encounter and feel our wedding experience was marred 😢😢
Oct 2016,50,Faultless stay,"Stayed in a resort room in the grounds of the main hotel , very clean facilities . Would certainly return! Had a lovely pool view. Main hotel was also spotless. Good choice of food . Own private beach also stunning!"
Oct 2016,50,Amazing place to stay,Cant fault the place at all staff very friendly very helpful and the apartment was very spacious and had more than everything to help make a fantastic holiday the pools were great all 7 of them probably one of the best holidays my family have had cannot say enough about the place..wish i was there now
Sep 2016,50,Grande Real Santa Eulalia Hotel,"My daughter and I where staying at the Grade Real Santa Eulalia Hotel for 2 nights.We where in Albufeira for a family wedding. We arrived at the hotel early and we didnot have much time to get ready  as the wedding was at 2pm the same day.The hotel staff got our room ready for 11:15am which was great. They where very helpful,great staff great hotel."
Sep 2016,40,A most Engaging Hotel!,"we only stayed for one night, but I fell in love with this hotel! the room was very, very spacious! Strong AC and very well appointed bathroom! the bed was very, very firm, but otherwise the room was perfect. The hotel had multiple pools, but it was beach side, so that was where we spent our time! the beach was perfect- crowded, but the water and sand were ideal - calm and smooth. Do keep in mind, there are lots of loungers with umbrellas, but those are not for the hotel- you must pay for those- some gentlemen sit near the little boardwalk and you pay them.  there are cliffs around and you can walk up and have a terrific view. It is most romantic!!   the entire property has a very romantic, resort like feel to it!  The resort is close to town as well, and I wish I'd had a week to stay!"
Sep 2016,40,Couple holiday,Went for 1week as a couple of 27 and 31 beautiful hotel great facilities. Beach gorgeous and small and lovely and quiet. No problem getting beds at pool housekeeping great and clean. Spa gorgeous but have to pay. It's a fair walk to new town 5€ in taxi and 8€ in a taxi to old town. Restaurants only ate in 1 was good but expensive ate out every other night. Have to pay for sunbeds on beach kind of annoying. Also did not like the fact check out was 10am for apartments and 12 for hotel kind of degrading and 10am is abit much for a 5star you would think atleast 11am. Overall nice hotel good facilities
Sep 2016,40,First family holiday ,"Just back from our first family holiday and stayed for 9 days. On the whole we had a good time but when we checked in with a 9 month old we were told out apartment was on the first floor, not acceptable!!. We were however moved to a more suitable room at an additional charge. The pool areas are excellent and not too crowded at this time of year and have plenty of beds and umbrellas. We are at the burger restaurant (v good) and at cafe atlantico. The service was very mixed at cafe atlantico, ranging from polite and efficient to indifferent and argumentative. It's a good hotel but not all that some of the guests think it is. Better for couples or older clientele rather than families."
Sep 2016,30,lovely holiday,overall we had a lovely time was very comfortabe staying at the hotel food was more or less the same everyday. good child care facilities. i liked that you have to have a card to get to the beach which is a private beach only for hotel users. we paid alot of money to stay here would have just been nice if they offered a better package especially for 12 people
Sep 2016,40,Great stay,"We stayed in the first week of September and were upgraded from a studio to a one bedroom apartment. This was  very clean, spacious and well-equipped although the decor might not be to everyone's taste (a bit dated). One of the loveliest things was to be able to reach the pool straight from our terrace in seconds. Due to the time of year (schools having gone back) it wasn't crowded at all and we always managed to get a sun bed.There are plenty of little supermercados around where you can buy supplies and we also hired mountain bikes to explore the surrounding area which was great fun.The gym was pretty well equipped too, with a separate room for stretching etc.I would say the only drawback was the price of meals at the hotel. We only ate there once for the evening buffet and it was a whopping 35 euros per person for food only. This wouldn't have mattered had it been of exceptional quality, but it was very mediocre. As a consequence, we either ate out at one of the many local restaurants or in our little apartment, which really did feel like a home from home.The staff were generally very friendly and pleasant and the weather was amazing. We had a wonderful time."
Sep 2016,50,"Great hotel,1 bed apartment.","We have just had a lovely week at this hotel .The  staff were very helpful and friendly .I loved the fact we went by golf buggy to our apartment.The apartment was on the ground floor with a terrace .It  was wonderful to sit there and eat our lunch with the smell of rosemary and Pine trees .Its  really lovely and quiet too, apart from the odd noise of children in the hotel next door.The rooms are a little tired and dated, but I did quite like the coloured tiles in the bathroom! The kitchen was well equipped for what we needed and we had a huge tv in the lounge.The beds were very comfortable.We had a maid service everyday,they too were friendly.The location of this hotel is quite away from the old town of Albufeira,but we really enjoyed the peace and quiet after the hustle and bustle of the new & Old town.There is a free courtesy bus for 27 people several times a day .I  think some evenings they could have put a larger bus on. The last one to town was 7.20,so we were organised to leave then. We caught the little tourist train from the old town to the new town and then walked back ,this  took about 20 minutes. the train is great and runs until 1 am.The swimming pools were great,we used the pool close to our apartment.lots of sun beds and again ,very quiet.We loved this hotel,also be on fantastic beach was superb,we ate at the fish restauraunt twice,and at the snack bar.We had a totally great experience at this hotel and would love to come back next year."
Sep 2016,40,Lovely hotel that could be made better,"We were booked into this hotel through On the beach as a back up to our original choice near to the old town.Positives:Rooms were very clean and cleaned every day. Top marks to the cleaning staff.Staff were all accommodating, friendly and immaculately dressed.Courtesy bus to new and old town.Beach was close by and clean.Décor wouldn't be our choice, but it was done to a good quality.Bed was very comfortable and the room was very quiet.Not so good:Walk was too far to old town, around 1 hour through busy roads and villas, so would like to see the courtesy bus hours extended.Courtesy bus stops at 7.20, so we paid 8Euros every night for a taxi back from the old town.Not much in the way of entertainment in or within 10mins walk of the hotel.Food and drinks were expensive. Prices comparable to a Uk South England hotel.Beach was very busy on the couple of days we ventured down there. It didn't seem very exclusive!15Euros for 2 sunbeds for a full day or 10Euros up to 2pm."
Sep 2016,50,Pure Luxury,This hotel was the sister hotel of where we were staying.  When we walked in I just drew a large gasp - it was absolutely stunning.  ~We had a good look around and stayed for a drink on the veranda.  This is where every woman wants to stay!!!!!
Sep 2016,50,my wedding,"Held my wedding here last week and it was perfect. The venue, food, staff, everything amazing, could not of asked for a better day. We had a suite overlooking the sea, breathless, two balconies, two bathrooms, amazING."
Sep 2016,20,"Interior designers send your CV hurry, please!",This time I stayed in a one bedroom apartment which is huge. The buildings outside are beautiful but the interior is just horrendous. It is a vomit of random colors which make the space dated. The mattress is hard like a rock. The good news is that it is a king size. The sheets are old and thinner than a paper. The cleanness was paramount. Not a single hair on the floor. For a supposedly 5 stars hotel it is a shame that the apartments don't have room service. The bathroom amenities are great from Castelbel (Portuguese luxury brand of soaps).
Sep 2016,40,Very Enjoyable Wedding,"I attended this hotel for a wedding being held there.I found the hotel rooms to be large, comfortable and with a good view.The access to the beach is a bonus, but it would be nice to have access to a normal sized pool which would allow swimming.The food was good, but would like a slightly greater range of bar foods during the day.It is fairly quiet at night, but the hotel supplies taxies quickly, and lay on free transport into Albufeira during the dayIt is a nice hotel, but not really 5 star"
Sep 2016,40,Relaxing holiday,"Stayed there for 10 days in August. Nice hotel but very quiet on the night time. Room was clean and big with a large sea view balcony. No problem getting a sun bed if you got down to the pool before 10am, although some still put towels on beds and left them for hours before returning. First time here and would rate it 4 star not 5."
Sep 2016,40,Spotless. ..but not 5 star..,Just back from family holiday...nice hotel...let down a bit by unfriendly staff...few smiles and better manners would have been nice...can't fault the lady who cleaned our room and staff at the spa. ..could do with a bit of entertainment round the pools ..or background music....prices bit steep too for food and drink...but all in all nice place...
Sep 2016,20,none,"booked the hotel,or so I thought on arrival we were shown to our room one bedroom apartment,not even in the hotel the room was so outdated more like a 3 star than 5 star.Not what I was shown when I booked through Thomas cook."
Sep 2016,20,3* pretending to be a 5* AVOID,"Stayed here with my wife and two sons for a week in August while attending a family wedding in Albufeira. On first impressions hotel looked like a 5* property, but after being shown to out ""Resort View"" rooms our opinion changed dramatically! Having booked two rooms and requesting they were interconnecting or side by side, as our son has learning disabilities, we found that the hotel had ignored this request and placed us 8 rooms apart. On explaining, we were given two rooms side by side on the same floor - the ground - and these overlooked the car park at the front of the hotel! Hardly a view of the resort. On requesting a move we were met with stoney expressions at reception and the assistant manager was even less accommodating, insisting that rooms were not available, and those that were unoccupied were not allocated to our tour company. Our rooms were 4 yards from constant comings and goings in the car park, there was a constant rumble of tyres on cobbles and dust was thrown up continuously. We couldn't sit out or enjoy any ""balcony experience"" and privacy was minimal with people passing back and forth all day and most of the night. Be wary of booking these so called ""Resort View"" rooms as this is what you will get. Rooms were clean and roomy but decor very dated with scratched furniture, terrible TV reception and despite reporting a light out it was never replaced all week. Water was provided on our first day but after had to be paid for daily, at a ridiculous cost. Needless to say we bought our own locally. Having stayed in many top hotels this barely measured up and we had always had water provided in this standard of hotel on a  daily basis, especially in the height if summer. The cleaning was good and our maid was cheerful and polite and always accommodating. We booked B and B and the breakfast experience could only be described as appalling! On our first visit we queued for 15 minutes to get into the breakfast restaurant, and this was the case every day, except one - why? Because we had to be taken to a table by the one waiter given this duty. When arriving at a table we were not offered tea or coffee but expected to use a machine. Tables weren't set and so having given our room numbers at the door we could have just found a table and the queuing could have been eliminated. Clearly this was a disorganised and badly run facility. The noise levels were awful, the atmosphere frenetic and it resembled a 2* holiday camp. Tables were left uncleared, glasses were not available on some mornings and the whole experience was very far removed from what a breakfast in a 5* hotel should be. We found the waiters rude and we were rarely given a smile or a good morning, and often we felt that we were simply an inconvenience for them and that they just wanted breakfast over and done with. Some serious customer relations training is needed in this hotel. We eventually asked for a table outside on the terrace most mornings as although often too hot, even under the badly placed sun umbrellas, it was preferable to the noise levels inside. When asking for a pot of coffee for two on our first visit we were told by a very rude waiter to use the machine. I complained to his superior and we did eventually get a coffee pot. This we had to insist on every morning.The pools were many but we always had to wait for a sun bed, whichever we went too, this despite the manager's welcoming letter telling us that beds were not allowed to be reserved and towels would be removed after 30minutes if beds were left. Clearly the policy was not enforced as at no time did we see any pool attendants removing towels even when beds were grabbed, guests went to breakfast or lunch and didn't return after one or sometimes two hours. Once we sat and timed this. Staff really couldn't have cared less.If you are after a 5* holiday experience don't book this hotel. Ironically the entrance to the hotel has boards detailing the name of the hotel with 5 gold stars underneath. One of these had a star missing and the other had two stars which had dropped down from their supports. Typical I would say of a resort that misses the detail necessary to provide a 5 * experience for guests. A hint as we passed through the gates of what was to come. If only we had known."
Sep 2016,40,Nice Hotel,"Really nice hotel and grounds.  Room was spacious and spotless, and there were several pools and plenty of space to relax.Choice of places to eat was okay, but overpriced for what you get, though a short walk away there are plenty of other restaurants anyway.And as others have said, entertainment wasn't anything to write home about.  Had a singer with backing tracks a couple of times, but that was about it.  Had the entertainment side of it been important to us I'd probably score them a bit lower, but as a hotel it was ideal for us."
Sep 2016,50,Relaxed holiday by the beach,"We chose this hotel as part of a Jet2 package holiday as it was recommended as a family friendly hotel. It certainly lived up to this name, and in particular was a very baby friendly hotel, which was important as it was our first holiday abroad with our ten month old. The hotel has all the amenities you need for a baby which are free to borrow, including a cot, steriliser, bottle warmer, baby bath.On arrival we were upgraded to a one bedroom apartment from a studio, which proved very useful as it meant the baby could sleep in the bedroom while we relaxed in the living room/terrace. The kitchenette had everything you could need including a microwave, although as usual you need to bring your own washing up liquid etc.We only ate breakfast at the hotel so can't comment on the other meals, though the BBQ lunch certainly looked good. The breakfast had a lot of choice (especially the cheese, cold meats, breads and fruit) and was generally very tasty, but the selection was the same every day so by the end of the week it got a bit boring.The pools were very nice, there are several spread throughout the resort, only a couple of them were heated at the end of Aug/start Sept so they were more crowded. We only ventured to the beach once, it was an easy walk even with the buggy and it was clean, sandy and not too crowded. Try the El Pescador restaurant for amazing fish!The spa was amazing too, the half price specials are well worth it if you can go in the morning - the 50 minute relaxation massage was just perfect!Another plus was the free shuttle bus downtown (though would be good if it ran more regularly).There are a couple of supermarkets not too far away, where you can get most things such as water, alcoholic drinks, bread, milk, tea etc. A tip for those travelling with babies: nappies and baby food jars are readily available, baby formula was not (except for large tubs of powder!).Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel for families, and hope to return with my little one in future, though I'd go when it's a bit cooler!Room tip: ask for firmer pillows if you prefer!"
Sep 2016,40,Great hotel that lacks fun,"Really good 4 star hotel - but not 5 star.Arrived at 11am and we were given free room upgrade which was a fantastic one bedroom apartment and it was ready at 11am - superb - 5 starsMaid service in room - spotless - 5 starsGreat location for beach and in a quiet part of resort - 5 starsPools small but adequate, being an early riser I was poolside by 8 most mornings enjoying the sun and a good book - never once seen pool cleaned - seen a guy flick sand about on occasions - but deck and tables by the sun loungers were never cleaned - looked at same stains on tables for 9 days and at same bug encrusted cat poo on the poolside deck for a week to - was still there when we left - 2 starsPoolside snack bar - service was brilliant the young lady a credit to the hotel - 5 starsPoolside snacks - nice sandwich at 10 euros for one should be exceptional but we're not - they were nice - but for 10 euros !!!! - 3 starsBreakfast fare - very good food - chaotically organised - often stood waiting for items to be replenished and the serving area is to small - 4 starsEvening buffet - average fare and 35 euros a person !!! - 3 starsBurger bar - we were seated and 2 staff members ran around serving a busy Restraunt whilst 2 lazy staff watched from bar area - they were not venturing beyond their allotted space to help whatever.

Sep 2016,50,Lovely Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for my sons wedding, lovely hotel, friendly and helpful staff.The hotel offers also offers family rooms with self catering, but cannot comment has we did not stay in one.This hotel has great views.Good comfy beds.We stayed at a busy time but had no problem getting sun beds, it has two nice pools.The beach is just outside the hotel [via locked gate] which is easy to reach.The food is fantastic.The hotel offers a courtesy bus into the main town [and back], nice touch.My son had his wedding here and they have a private area overlooking the beach, absolute lovely and great for photos.I would recommend this hotel, and will certainly be returning.Bad Points.Rooms looking a little tired for a 5 star, but still clean.No tea or coffee in room."
Sep 2016,10,Please be aware when booking,"As Portugal is over booked this summer the hotel is giving rooms in another property it claims to belong to the hotel, but it is under a different management. So basically instead of staying in a 5 star resort with service. They put you in a separate hotel that they claim they ""own""... This is outright fraudulent, and unethical. They refuse to refund the money when the guest is unhappy, and basically ruin they're vacation. Please be aware when booking this hotel. The hotel itself if unworthy of a 5 star hotel. Any holiday inn in the US is superior to this resort. Please DO NOT book here, and save yourself the heart ache of a ruined vacation and the feeling of being outright defrauded. ( this is my 1st 1 star review in my history of reviews)"
Aug 2016,50,Chilled Holiday!,"We stayed B&B in a studio apartment which was spacious and clean.  The food was lovely and the service was very good.  The pools were quiet as the hotel is on the beach.  We had such a lovely, relaxing time and loved this hotel."
Aug 2016,50,Amaziiiiiinnnggggg resort,What can i say..fantastic beautiful clean resort with fantastic facilities. The whole package was excellent...the staff were so helpful cannot fault any of it....there were 7 pools which meant you could always find sunbeds and very clean . The snackbars and on site snsckbars and restaurants were great..the one facing the beach was the best
Aug 2016,50,Another fab holiday,Our family (2 adults & 2 kids 17yr & 14yrs) has just returned from another great holiday here. We stayed in a 2 bedroom resort suite on HB basis. The suite was extremely spacious and had everything we needed. We go on holiday to completed relax so no cooking! Breakfast is amazing and caters for everyone. Evening buffet good too. Drinks by pool can be a bit pricy but you'd expect that in holiday season. Staff are very lovely and welcoming and a fantastic holiday was had yet again.
Aug 2016,40,Wonderful stay,"Had a wonderful stay at this hotel. We stayed self catering and found the room to be well kitted out very clean, well maintained and the maids visited every day. Air conditioning was lovely and cool so we all found we had a great nights sleep. The whole complex was clean and tidy and all the swimming pools were well maintained. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Free small bus put on by the hotel to the new and old town but from our experience give the old town a miss! Hotel was located right next to a lovely small beach. Various restaurants and bars located in the complex which were ok, we preferred to find restaurants out of the complex and some of those were ok. Overall great experience."
Aug 2016,40,Great hotel,"This is a very good hotel with excellent facilities. Our room was large, clean, and comfortable with a very large and comfortable bed. The room had a TV, a safe, a fridge, plenty of drawers and hanging space. They supply a bottle of water when you arrive but this is not replaced during your stay. (Our fridge didn't work during our stay despite telling reception a few times. They did send somebody to look at it but it never worked.)The bathroom was spacious, had a bath as well as a shower (shower was in the bath, not separate) and the shower was pretty good. Toiletries were supplied and replaced daily. Housekeeping couldn't be faulted. They were excellent.The hotel itself was lovely. Reception staff were great and very helpful.Breakfast was buffet style and there was loads of choice, including buffet style hot food as well as you can ask them to cook omelettes or poached eggs for you. Also, many different cold meats, cheeses, breads and pastries, jams and preserves.1 criticism was that the scrambled eggs were really watery!The poolsides were quite busy but we didn't use them much. There is a path down to the beach but this is NOT a private beach and you have to pay for sunbeds and parasols (€10 for half day, €15 for full day for 2 beds). But the hotel provides you with beach towels so if you don't want to pay this you can buy your own parasol and use the towels on the sand.There is a fully equipped gym with lots of cardio machines as well as resistance machines and free weights. It needs to be cooler in there though and the water provided needs to be chilled.The restaurant that belongs to the hotel (but is not exclusive to hotel guests) was very good and we ate there a few times. (I can't find a separate listing sadly).The location is excellent as it's outside the 'clubby/pubby' area so it's nice and quiet but only a 10-15 minute walk into town.If you stay here I would recommend hiring a car as there is so much more to see in the Algarve.There are a couple of little things that aggravated, like our fridge not working. We bought water and kept it in the fridge but it was never really cold. And in 36°c I think that is necessary. Also, no facilities to make tea/coffee in your room.However, I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you have kids with you. If you want a really quiet hotel then this isn't for you especially during school holidays as there are lots of children. But it's a fun place and a lovely hotel."
Aug 2016,40,Short Break in a relaxing resort,"Myself and boyfriend were looking for a reasonable but GOOD hotel to stay for a short 4 day break for our first trio to Portugal, and this was what we found. We are used to staying in luxury accommodation and though this was nice I wouldn't really call it five star maybe a four it may have been our room, we had a self catering room and the way in which the space as organised was really good the only appliance wee used in the kitchen was the fridge, so no comment on the facilities the bed was comfy and i think the sofa was a sofa bed which as it was only myself and my partner we didn't really use. The facilities around the hotel were nice we didn't really use the pools as it was a bit chilly but there were loads of pools and the hotel is really nice to walk around as its so big the views of the beach and caves were really pretty. The location of the hotel is good as its a walk of around 15 minutes walk to the strip and restaurants and shops there is a bus stop outside the hotel but we didn't use it and there are cabs a plenty.  Oh a Tip if you're using cabs grab one of the cards from the front desk with the hotels address as neither I or my boyfriend could pronounce the hotels name properly so we got some strange looks and confused  cab drivers, there is a shuttle that goes from the hotel to town but it can get a bit crowded. We had a meal at the hotel seafood restaurant and it was yum. Oh and we had treatments at the spa facials and hot stone massages which were very relaxing. Overall good experience however would stay in a upgraded room."
Aug 2016,20,Unfortunate damage management,"Unfortunately left the resort and holidays with not the best feelings and casualties. On the time of leaving staff came to pick up my luggage and while lifting it, they broke the handle. That caused a lot of inconvenience during my trip back to Lisbon airport and back home (imagine dragging big luggage with no handle). And the worst part is that hotel refused to refund the damage cost that their staff made. Call it five star treatment."
Aug 2016,40,Nice to return,"My wife and I have returned for a week in this most pleasant hotel over the beach of Santa Eulália. Near Albufeira, but enough distance of the tourist massification spots, the hotel have a privileged position, in a very quiet area. Total silence at night.  Something that we appreciated. Night attractions are just in 10/15 minutes walking distance. The service continues to be of good quality. Personally I find the staff even more motivated this year. The room cleaning ladies team are so efficient as discreet. The room was always spotless. Breakfast is a must, with plenty of choices, high quality products, in a beautiful setting near the pool or over the beach.  The breakfast team could not be more helpful to assist you. The only problem are the hotel’s pools that are too small, and not deep enough, to whom love to swim and always crowed with families, some making lots of noise, with no problems to disturb the others guest. But to those who love beach, this will not be an issue."
Aug 2016,50,Stunning resort,We have just got back from having a fantastic time at this resort. I would not say the apartments are 5 star but everything else about our stay was. The breakfast was fantastic and catered for everyone.The staff and the facilities were all 5 star. We would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family and we will definitely come back and stay here again. We had tears in our eyes when we had to leave which just went to show how much we enjoyed our stay at this resort.
Aug 2016,50,"Excellent, we loved it.","This hotel is just perfect. We always book a 5 star hotel. Last year we where to a 5star grekhotel in Greece. We did not like this at all. Pushing for tips. Therefore we where looking for a 5 star hotel that was not so big.Grande Real did not had a 9+ score so we doubted it. I must say this hotel is one of the best we ever had.Not because of the luxury. The hotel is not so big. No showcooking but what they offer is perfect. All in Portugese style. So blue carpet. The bar: Every night life music. They make good cocktails. The staff is very friendly and very relaxed (as everybody in this hotel)What I really liked of this hotel is the very relaxed why work and contact you. This is not made, this is how they are.The buffet restaurant: The choices are not so big as we used to have. But what they make is 100% perfect. A good balance in healthy food and fine (excellent) taste. We eat there pretty often. The staff is extremely friendly. Nothing is a problem for them. You ask and they will do it for you with a big smile.Restaurant Atlantico. Nice for a lunch. What they make is nothing special but what they make is good. Fishrestaurant, is perfect. Nice staff and reallly good food.Restaurant Pérgula. This was not my favorite. Just a burger. What they made was good but not my personal style of food.Disco: once a week there is a disco from sunset till sunset. You can not hear the sound so do not worry but this is nice for kids that have the right age for it.The rooms: The beds can be for some people to hard. For me it was perfect.The beach, Portugal has no privated beaches, so you have to pay the a good seat. Therefore you get a lot of good extra's. 3-6 lifeguards everyday on the beach. Safe. They check very good for safety on the water. (No jetskis are allowed on the swimming part as it should be. But they are very strict with it to. You can like it or not. But they lifeguard will call the police if you enter the beach with a jetski for a second time)The hotel has some small shops around and on 5 minutes walking a supermarket.If you want a hotel with a fabulous view, friendly staff, good food and a nice priced drinks/food go for it. Absolute worth the 5 stars and I highly recommend this."
Aug 2016,30,"Great location, but not at all 5 stars, maybe 4","The Grande Real Santa Eulalia has a great location, right on the beach. It is definitely the hotels top selling point, and also the reason for splashing out a little extra to stay here. The buildings are nice, but the rooms have seen better times. Loose towel racks, smelly shower curtain to mention some details. (We told housekeeping, but they did not fix it) A 5 star resort does not have plastic cups in the room (one cup for 2 people???), a 5 star hotel also changes bed sheets when there are food stains on them.The pool area is too small. You will never find a chair, unless you reserve one at 08am. This is of course not allowed by the hotel, but when confronting the staff with the fact that people were keeping sunbeds for hours without using them, they simply replied that they must be in the pool. Interesting considering the pool was very small and nearly empty. The fact that the staff have private conversations on their phones amongst guests is something I expect more from a 1-2star property. Head down to the beach, only 15EUR for 2 beds and an umbrella for a full day. Have your lunch at O Pescador and not Atlantico, unless you want to be treated by stressed out, disrespectful staff.Breakfast is very good, maybe a little crowded, but it's a large hotel, so have patience. The guys at the upstairs bar (reception) are also very friendly and forthcoming.I don't want to sound to negative, but this is a hotel in a situation where it wants to be 5star, but where many of the staff only offer 3 star service.  It must be a management problem. If the Santa Eulalia gets its act sorted when it comes to guest relations and housekeeping, then we would definitely return."
Aug 2016,40,Nice hotel,"We booked this hotel as a last minute deal for our anniversary. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to others visiting the area. Here were some of or pros/cons;*Pro - We let the hotel staff know prior to our arrival that it was our anniversary and we were very touched that after we arrived they bought up a free room service trolley with sparkling wine and chocolates, which was the most wonderful start to the holiday.*Pro- The room was lovely, and we had a sea view which was stunning. The room was clean and comfortable and felt luxurious.*Pro- One of the main 'pros' for me was the private beach!!! You have to access through a gate and there are cliffs either side so you have a long stretch of private beach just for hotel guests which is wonderful and feels very safe. There is a small cafe by the beach which I would highly recommend for lunches and tasty snacks. It is very reasonably priced, with lovely views out over the sea. *Pro- There is a lovely fish restaurant walking distance away. There are a few options for dining in the hotel. *Pro - The Spa is lovely but very expensive. We had a wonderful couples massage.*Pro-  There is a free shuttle bus into town which was a great idea and very useful.*Con-  We decided to order room service one night. We rang down and placed our order. An hour and a half later it still hadn't arrived so we called down to check when it was due to arrive. They said they had forgotten to write down the room number and would take the order again now. We then waited a further hour for it to arrive. When it did I was surprised to see that they had not taken any money off the bill, nor did they offer any drinks/ extras as way of apology. I think this is poor service for a 5 star hotel as it was their error which led to a 2 and a half hour delay. *Con- One night we went down for dinner at the new burger restaurant On arrival I was shocked and saddened to see that all their burgers were Veal. I do not eat veal and was saddened by this, I can understand having it as an option but do not understand why they all have to be veal.*Con - The evening buffet is expensive for what it is, and the food wasn't great.So , the location , beach and room made this trip very special. The dining options were not brilliant though.  I would however still return due to that lovely beach!"
Aug 2016,50,Fantastic,Lovely hotel in excellent location. Breakfast was superb. Pool bars great. Room blackouts means no early wake ups with morning sunshine. Beads firm but comfy. Air con throughout hotel no always comfortable
Aug 2016,50,Little piece of heaven,"Love this hotel, this has been our 6th year in a row and would not consider anywhere else. TravelWith 3 children ages 13,12 and 10. Breakfast is a big hit with the children and they love sampling the great variety of fresh fruit, cooked breakfast and delicious sweet delicacies! The apartment is clean, spacious and has all amenities. However this year we have noticed a lot of people booking sunloungers with towels before we have even had breakfast which is not allowed and very naughty.The staff are fantastic- very pleasant and courteous at all times! Love this place!"
Aug 2016,50,Spectacular!!,"This was our first trip to the Algarve, and it was beyond my expectations.  We have traveled to the Carribean and seen some beautiful beaches, but this beach at the resort was ABSOLUTELY beautiful!! The water was refreshing and my kids loved riding the waves.  The only drawback for me was that if you wanted a lounge chair, you had to rent it for the day.  At a 5-star resort, this is something that should be included for the guests.The hotel was gorgeous, clean and the service was great among all the staff members that I encountered.  Everyone at the hotel was so pleasant and helpful. The food was sooooooooo delicious!  We ate at the buffet most of the time because we wanted to sample a little bit of everything, and the buffet provided that for us.  We did eat one night at the Atlantico, and the food was very good too.  The breakfast buffet gives you quite a variety.We also enjoyed the singing entertainment at night.  We loved listening to both Portuguese and American songs.  A nice way to end our day every night.All in all, this was a wonderful place to stay, and I highly recommend it.  Such a beautiful resort!"
Aug 2016,40,Ideal location with luxury and a fantastic beach!,Huge complex and we stayed in our own apartment which was a great option from the standard hotel room. Really spacious room with a large lounge and kitchen area and its own balcony although it's worth noting most rooms have their own balcony and seating too.We didn't eat in the restaurant but the bar has a great view over the beach which has to be the highlight of the complex.Definitely worth taking advantage of one of the many spa treatments which was a great relaxing end to our stay.Ideally located just less than half hour walk down in to the old toe and there is a shuttle bus that goes back and forth although did think it could run more often and later into the evening.
Aug 2016,40,Lovely relaxing holiday.,Just returned from a weeks holiday feeling totally relaxed after our lovely stay.Was a bit dubious after reading some negative reviews. We had a sea facing room which had stunning views and the biggest bed ever.Cleaned everyday and was spotless.We only had breakfast which we thought was very good with a huge selection. We did have a few drinks but thought was generally hotel prices so a bit expensive but what was expected.Walked everyday to local village where they had good restaurants and bars. Would recommend Rock line for cheep drinks.Eddys next door for snacks and Pualos Pizza. Avoid the New town strip late at night if you have young children.Overall brill holiday and due to return in 1 month for a birthday treat.Lastly must see Super popcorn man at Rock line bar keeps kids and husband entertained!!!
Aug 2016,30,Definitely NOT five-star quality!!,"Excellent staff,  good views but room was definitely NOT five-star quality.Carpet was stained and worn, as were the two dressing table stools and dressing table chair, table on balcony was falling apart with pieces of plastic tape hanging off it, balcony chairs lacked cushions and were starting to look worn, bathroom taps and shower unit need updating to something more modern, dressing table itself had lost some of its varnish and was scratched.TV was not tuned in properly and had very limited channels available, windows and balcony glass and railing were not wiped at all during our stay and had seagull droppings which were not removed.Food in restaurant was average but again not five star quality - often lukewarm regardless of time of arrival.Night time entertainment basically non-existent - when we stayed at a 3-star Quinta in Old Town Albuferia there were nightly shows ranging from dancers to acrobats to singers, even a parrot show (for adults not children) - every night had TWO acts which were never repeated in the week we stayed.Lack of sunbeds around pool area - for other five star hotels we have stayed at pool staff would bring additional sunbeds as and when required.  At least one pool area should be made adults only as impossible to swim due to large volume of children jumping in and out, running around and playing with toys in pool."
Aug 2016,30,"Mixed reviews, not for everyone","This is a rather large resort, and has everything you need ,but not necessarily what you want.  There seems to be a lot of families with young children, so a quiet time for couples is not what you should expect.  The beach itself is nice, but small. It's crowded when the resort is busy like in August. There's really no place to walk to, and the hotel does offer a free shuttle to town and has a limited schedule. Breakfast is a large buffet and is zooish when busy.Albufeira is a very commercial resort town and if traveling by taxi you should expect long wait times...long wait times.My wife and I enjoyed the spa which has nice amenities and good treatments. The food is not outstanding but certainly adequate. Our room is spacious and comfortable, and I highly recommend an ocean facing room."
Aug 2016,50,Fantastic!!!!,"Just ended 10 days in this beautiful hotel with my 2 daughters 16 and 12. The place is enormous but on arrival from the airport we we greeted by the bellhops who took our luggage to the reception desk for check in. There are a good number of staff so we were attended to immediately. We were self catering but they suggested that I could put money on my room number which can be used for meals and drinks all over the resort, this was very handy not having to carry cash around. I had booked us a resort suite which could have slept 5 people so as there was only 3 of us it was more than suitable. The room was spotless, the cleaners came every day. It had a safe and its own wifi which the girls were very pleased about!I had read that the restaurants on site were quite expensive but we out out a few times in the nearby town and none of the places we ate in came anywhere near the quality of the food in the hotel and the prices were very similar.The hotel is on the beach which was busy but plenty of space for everyone. There were people still in the sea at 9.30pm it was that warm. There was a nice snack bar which had live music most nights and sells amazing mojitos and overlooks the beach and next door to this was a more formal restaurant.There are a couple of more restaurants within the hotel as well as the pool snack bars.Room service is available 24/7 which we made use of a couple of times and again not too costly but extremely handy especially when we didn't feel like getting dressed and going out.I needed a rental car for a day and this was arranged by a call to reception, no problem.Overall a very well run hotel with the friendliest and helpful staff I have ever encountered! I am looking forward to my next visit already!"
Aug 2016,40,trip with family,"Arrived in August 2016. We had booked two classic inland view rooms and were without asking upgraded to two sea view rooms with garden next door to each other. At this point I was very pleased. Rooms were large and fairly modern, had good A/C and were close to reception. Staff were helpful, maid came daily and the location is on the beach with a few minutes walk.Several restaurants all good. We especially liked the Atlantico and went several times.Just one minor gripe, the pools for this standard and size of hotel are way too small and really need upgrading  but it was still ok and didn't spoil the holiday especially with the ocean on our doorstep.I am really glad I chose this resort and would come again."
Aug 2016,50,Good value Hotel,"Stayed here in March for 7 nights on a half board basis with Jet 2. Was a bit apprehensive as there were some mixed reviews on TA.PositivesGreat views of Santa Eulalia beach from our roomBuffet didn't have a great choice but what was there was of good quality and we didn't go hungryStaff all very friendlyFree bus into AlbuferaNegativesRoom starting to look a bit tired with several stains on carpet Location a bit remote with the nearest shop 15minute walkDrinks were expensiveWe had a good value stay and given the stunning views of Santa Eulalia, decent food and friendly staff would stay again."
Aug 2016,30,not super but ok,it is a huge resort with plenty facilities for tourists enjoy swimming pools and hamburgers.The beach is private 20euros per daywithout showers and toilet.Very clean very good breakfast.The fish restaurant very expensive.
Aug 2016,50,Excellant Resort & Holiday,"Lovely hotel and facilities right on the beach.  Reception area really nicely decorated, spacious and comfortable for relaxing. Plenty of really nice outside space, loungers and chairs for relaxing.  We had a one bedroom self catering apartment which had everything we needed and was very spacious for the four of us.  Quiet location on the beach and a 15/20 min walk to the town which we didn't mind. Would definitely revisit."
Aug 2016,40,Very nice resort but not quite 5-star,"The Grande Real Santa Eulalia is a newer and upscale beach hotel in Albufeira. It is a short trip from the “Old Town” area of Albufeira, about 7km or an 8 euro Uber ride (yes, they have Uber in Albufeira). Overall, it is a nice hotel and probably one of the best choices in the area. I would not consider it on par with some other 5-star properties I have experienced, but it is very favorably priced.  We stayed 4 nights at the hotel with 12 people across 5 rooms. We did have an issue with the rooms upon check-in. Though the front desk staff did seem to go out of their way to help, I can’t say the issue was rectified to our satisfaction. When making reservations we had requested 2 of the rooms to be directly across the hall from each other, as connecting rooms weren’t available. We confirmed this with the hotel both via phone and email prior to arrival. When we arrived, the classes of rooms, sea view suite and resort view classic room, we assigned on different sides of the hotel. We explained that we had requested these rooms be directly across from each other as children would be staying in one of the rooms and adults in the other. The hotel was not able to manage these arrangements. We offered to change room classes, pay for an upgrade, or do whatever we could to ensure that these two rooms were next to each other or across from each other. After about 30 minutes of brainstorming and checking the computers, the staff was able to arrange rooms for us on the same floor in the same wing of the hotel. Unfortunately, the rooms were about 6-7 rooms apart, almost the entire distance of the long hallway. The staff truly seemed to go out of their way to help, but we were still not satisfied with these arrangements. The 2 of the 3 children who were planning on sharing the room ended up sleeping in mom and dad’s room. Had we know we wouldn’t be able to make these arrangements, we would have just saved the money and have the children and parents just share a room. We checked in on a Tuesday and checked-out on a Saturday. Though the hotel was crowded, it was tough to understand why there weren’t 2 rooms in closer proximity available. This issue on check-in definitely put a bit of a damper on our stay. Rooms in the hotel are great. Large, spacious, and well-appointed with new furniture. Sea view suites all had balconies and nice views of the ocean. Suites had 2 balconies and 2 full bathrooms. One of the couples in our group received a complimentary upgrade to the “Suite Exotica”. Kitchenette, living room, dining room, and 2 bathrooms. There are mini-fridges in the room but they don’t come stocked, which was disappointing. The hotel is large and one doesn’t want to have to walk all the way to the bar to get enjoy a nightcap. The beach behind the hotel, Praia de Santa Eulalia is beautiful but very crowded. It is not a private beach for the hotel guests, nor does the hotel provide beach chairs. Chairs are available for rent for 5 Euro for a half-day and 10 for a full day, not what one expects from a 5-star property. Arriving around 11AM at the beach meant no chairs or umbrellas available until around 1:30-2PM, when the half-day rentals opened up. We ended up having to go down early to reserve seating, which didn’t feel unfair given that we had to pay for it. Accessing the beach from the hotel is a bit of a trip. There is a staircase and pathway that would have provided a much shorter route from hotel guest rooms to the beach, but the access to this was locked during our stay. The Atlantico bar/restaurant nearest to the beach does not allow items to be charged to the room, so it was inconvenient for beach drinks and snacks. It’s about an 8-10 minute walk uphill from the beach to the pool bar, the closest source for drinks that can be charged to the hotel room. There is also a beach restaurant and bar at the end of the beach, O Pescador, which is reviewed separately. The beach was very beautiful directly behind the hotel. There was some seaweed, which increased significantly at high tide. Further up the beach, there seemed to be abundant seaweed, even at low tide. The beach chairs here were more readily available, but the beach area was definitely tarnished by the seaweed. The pools were nice, but also crowded. The pool area was nice in general, though not spectacular. Service at the small bar/restaurant at the pool was friendly but slow. Breakfast was included in our rate and the breakfast buffet offered a wide variety of average to above-average items and was enjoyable. The dinner buffet setup was confusing. During our 5 night stay, the dinner buffet items seemed to vary greatly. The first day we arrived, we walked past the dinner buffet, which was set up both inside and outside, and saw a wide variety of items available. We decided we would try the buffet the next night. We were not on a meal plan, and were advised we would need to pay a la carte to enjoy the buffet. When we arrived at the buffet the next night there was a much smaller selection, with no items set up outside, and the price for the buffet was the same as the previous night. Not wanting to pay the same amount for a much smaller selection, we decided against dining at the dinner buffet. Thankfully, the other on-site restaurant, Santa Eulalia Restaurante, was able to quickly set up a table for our large group. Though the service was rather slow, we appreciated their willingness to quickly accommodate us. We ate at Santa Eulalia Restaurante twice during our stay and overall enjoyed our meals. The service was on the slower side and not overly friendly, but not necessarily “bad.” The food is good and I enjoyed all the covert, starters, and entrees. We were a larger group, 12 people, and they did have a little trouble with delivering the right starters both nights. But they quickly rectified the issue and one of the nights we ended up with a free started as a result of the error. The prawns in chili sauce and simmered clams starters were both excellent. The tiger prawn with chili pepper and lemon entrée was also very enjoyable. The prawns were large and fresh and the seasoning and sauce was excellent. A large selection of fresh fish is iced in the display case and sold by weight. The fish is portioned as ordered and grilled. I ordered the red bream on our second visit and was impressed. The fish was simply seasoned and grilled and was wonderful. My only complaint was that I didn’t specify a desired amount when ordering and it was so good I wish I had a larger portion! For reference, the portion size they served was 400 grams. The view from the restaurant is gorgeous.Overall, this is a very nice hotel. The accommodations and service matched our expectation given the price. Though there were some inconveniences we don’t regret staying here and would consider the same hotel when returning to the area."
Aug 2016,50,Uk,Fabulous hotel for families with very friendly staff who provided excellent five star service. I really liked the location of the hotel and a bus service. I  would definitely recommend to friends and family.
Aug 2016,50,Excellent Again,"Second time staying here and as good as we had hoped for. Plentiful sunbeds, friendly staff and good food. Reception staff went out of their way to make my wife's birthday a bit more special. Only niggle is that the wifi needs to be upgraded however not a game changer, I'll definitely be back next year."
Aug 2016,30,Five star premises spoilt by rather rude service and unexpected costs.,"The hotel is a luxurious one with nicely designed spacious apartments in a wonderful location, right next to the beach. I liked my accomodation mostly as well as the gym, the only place where I found the service to be courteous and deserving of a 5-star hotel. Unfortunately, the service in other parts of the hotel leaves much to be desired. In particular, the service in the restaurant (I was there for breakfast and dinner) was rather rude, apart from the waitresses who were polite and attentive to diners' needs. The male staff ranged from frowning indifference to downright impolite. One particular waiter seemed to take it upon himself to make the patron's experience as bad as possible, frowning all the time and on one particular occasion - when I changed my table from outside to go inside as it was beginning to get cold and windy - he actually threw a hissy fit at me, complaining about my decision to change tables. I find this kind of behaviour unnacceptable for a hostel, let alone a 5 star hotel.Certain services, which are normally provided free of charge in lower quality hotels, must be rented and paid for at this hotel. This was the case with ironing facilities, for which the hotel charges €5 per day."
Jul 2016,50,Miss d king ,"Just came back friday after staying at the grand santa hotel in portugal for 11 days & what can i say wow what a fantastic holiday we had from the word go ! we knew it was going to be lovely as it was a 5 star & omg it lived up to its expectations if i could give it a higher star then we definetly would , what a absolutely georgeous hotel me & my children aged 15,& 12 also my niece stayed in the selfcatering apartment it hadeverything you need when your self catering, ppts pans dishes etc , the rooms were georgeous we had double sofa bed & a single sofa bed in living area with a huge double wardrobe also for all your things, microwave,kettle fridge etc also, the room were also large enough for a family bathroom georgeous very big & emaculate never stayed in such ageorgeous apartment ever, we were greeted at reception by lovely staff, checked in very quickly & then was taken to out room by golf buggy which i thought was amazing they wait on you hand & foot theres nothing bad i could say about this hotel its absolutely fantastic , we had a pool view which just made it even better couldnt of asked for more i would definetly rate this to everyone who is visiting portugal its such a beautifull place staff, maids everyone who works there are very kind & helpfull they work round theclock its emaculate well worth going 5* i wont go any lower anymore & will definetly be going back to stay here again soon ( amazing hotel xx) 😄😄🌇👍👍"
Jul 2016,40,Away from the hordes,"Family of 4 one week full board in August - despite getting full board our accommodation was actually a spacious apartment with little balcony and small kitchen. Great as although we booked one family room, we actually had our own bedroom separate to the kids and they had their own beds too. 7 separate swimming pools, kids playground, snack bars and just a short walk down to the beach. As it was up the top of the cliff we had great views.  There was a kids club too. We really enjoyed the food, lots of different types of salad, fish, sausage and other Portuguese fare.  There was a kids menu but it was a bit lacklustre and ours preferred to eat from the main buffet.  A couple of evenings there was a theme buffet.  If you go for more than a week it may get a bit same year, but we found it was great for one week.There was a free bus to and from Albufeira main town and beach about 15 mins drive away.  Nearer was a strip of shops about 10 mins walk away.  We had a fantastic time for a week and thought it was good value as we needed to spend little extra.  It would be expensive if you did things a la cartel for 2weeks though."
Jul 2016,10,Entry to the pool? That will be €20.,"The building is beautiful and the location is great...and that is where the advantages of staying here end.For me, when you are paying for a 5 star hotel you should at minimum expect to get free water daily, especially when staying in a country where 33 degrees is usual. But no, in fact you are given one litre on the day of arrival, and none after. This resulted in myself and my boyfriend having to order water one night as room service (reception could not give us water). In the local area 2L of water costs 19 cent. In the hotel? €11. This is a markup of almost 100 x the price. The outdoor pools were small, so we decided to go to the indoor pool which looked beautiful when I booked it online. When trying to enter the pool we were told it would cost €20 each as they considered the indoor pool to be part of the 'spa experiece'.There is a photographer who goes around offering to take photos of people for a fee, which I would expect from a street vendor, not in a hotel.The service in the pub is diabolical. We only drank there twice and both times it took us a long time to get served, and after putting in our orders we had to wait 8-10 minutes to actually get the drinks we ordered.  What did we order you ask? Perhaps a fancy cocktail which takes a while to mix?? Nope- a beer and a house red wine. As far as I can see the service is terrible because the hotel's ethos is to squeeze as much money as possible out of its guests. The reason as far as I could see for the terrible bar service was understaffing. There were too few workers, and the workers were a bit slow to compound this. All in all the atmosphere was that of a corporation trying to bleed their clients dry. I feel like when I pay that much for a hotel, I expect access to most amenities there, and good service if I choose to eat there. A hotel run by cheapskates I certainly will not be back."
Jul 2016,40,Great Hotel ,"Plus points:Brilliant spacious apartments. Clean,  and serviced daily. 5 pools. Good restaurant food. Friendly staff. Kids reptile and parrot show! Minus points:Lack of evening entertainment.Very expensive resteraunt . 29 euros for lunch per person!No private beach. Charged 10 euro a day for lounger."
Jul 2016,50,Perfect wedding location,"This was a stunning location for our wedding in May, The staff were exceptional from the initial meeting with Patricia and Angela to the waiting staff on the day. The food was of a very high standard of which all our guests commented. The wedding package included everything we wanted and more. Thank you Grande Real for making our special day so perfect."
Jul 2016,50,Fantastic family holiday ,"We stayed at the hotel early July from the minute we stepped into the hotel I was impressed staff at reception were lovely. We booked a suite room and it was ideal, good spacious clean room we had a big room with a separate living room which the children stayed on the sofa bed. The suite had 2 bathrooms, 2 balconies with a beautiful view of the sea and green area. Good selection at breakfast, pools were nicely heated no problem getting sun loungers. Pool bar staff were friendly. The kids club was a great facility ran 10-10 and I can't compliment the kid club staff enough excellent with the children it even ran swimming lessons which my little girl took advantage of and the guy giving the lessons was brilliant with her 🤗🤗 I found it hard to fault the hotel. The only issue I had was I struggled to get us as a family booked into the main hotel they kept trying to push apartment when I prefer staying in the main hotel. I will definitely book to stay in the hotel next year 😍 that's if we can book the suite again"
Jul 2016,40,"Clean, lovely hotel","Hotel clean, Breakfast was a bit  boring, warm stale hash browns, same goes for fried eggs, beans, tomatoes,. Wasn't impressed with breakfast meal choices,. We opted out of half board option, and thank goodness we did,. U were limited to buffet only,. We ate out every night, only a 15 minute (left out of main gate) brings you to loads of restaurants,.We chose chinese (twice), indian and Martins outside the gate,. A new restaurant had just opened opposite hotel gate (Portobello) which would be handy,.I think the drinks are overpriced in the hotel too,. Bottle of wine €17, same bottle in supermarkets was €3.99,.We ate at the beach restaurant every day for lunch and breakfast too,. Room spotless.Good location.Hired the trike to explore .To get bed around the pool area was near on impossible, everyone put towels out, although they did say they would remove towels but we didn't see this happening,. We had to sit on beach and pay for 2 beds and umbrella €15 full day €10 half day .We managed to get bed once at pool area,. Beds were gone by 9, 9:30am, More like a 4* hotel."
Jul 2016,50,We will be back!,"I was worried reading some of the reviews before I left but glad that it didn't put me off going. So its not a Four Seasons 5 star quality but what do you expect you don't pay top end 5 star prices. It had everything we needed for a brilliant holiday - relaxing pools, access to a beautiful beach and great restaurants nearby. We never had problems getting a sun lounger. As others have pointed out breakfast at 10am was very busy but eat a bit earlier and you will have a very relaxing experience. We found the choice great and the food was still appealing after eating every day for 2 weeks. We had an apartment which was ideal for our kids - it was cleaned beautifully everyday. Pools are lovely but no bells and whistles (e.g slides) to keep older kids entertained. If you plan on doing a few trips ( to slide and splash, zoomarine etc.), then it would be worth hiring a car. If not, then you don't really need one as everything is within 20 min walk or 7 euro taxi to old town. My only real gripe is the that the hotel should put on more frequent courtesy buses and have a more organized queuing system - everyday it was a free for all and people were always left disappointed. I will definitely return - only wish I didn't have to wait another year to do it!"
Jul 2016,50,Relaxing!,"A brilliant place to stay, we hired a car and visited many places in the area, Vilamora was beautiful!The Grande Real Santa Eulalia was a great hotel the staff are very friendly as is the people of Portugal, we are going back in October this will be my fourth visit to the area."
Jul 2016,40,Our second visit,"This time we took a sea view balcony and it was lovely. We had room 27 which had the sun from 1.30PM until sun down. Very hot when we were there. The room was clean and tidy. Pity there wasn't tea and coffee in the room. We tried both hotel restaurants, plus the two just outside the rear gate to the beach and the fish restaurant on the beach. We would rank the outside places a little better than the hotel, but not much in it. Drinks aren't cheap, but I would rather have the view that goes with it. If you want cheap drinks looking at a brick wall or rowdy holiday makers, then go to the Strip, which is a 20 minute walk. Ideal hotel for views, comfort and watching the world go by."
Jul 2016,50,Amazing!,"Came here for a week in April, the room was lovely! Very clean and the beds were very comfy. We only went bed and breakfast but the breakfast couldn't be faulted! The hotel is close by to shops and offers a free bus service to the old and new town and there's lovely places to eat there. The private beach was amazing and the facilities were brill, they even let us shower in the spa on our last day after check out. Would definitely go back!"
Jul 2016,40,Holiday,Had a great time weather very warm if I went again I would go when it is a little cooler and pick a hotel that didn't have as meny families and small children drinks at this hotel I thought were over priced
Jul 2016,40,would recommend,"stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks and the staff were extremely approachable and nice! over the two weeks we only had on problem which was with the bathroom light flickering, however once we rang reception they sent someone over to fix it in 10 minutes. the drinks in the hotel were reasonable and i enjoyed the live music they always played - my only problem with the bar is that sometimes they can take a while to serve your drinks. would definitely stay here again!"
Jul 2016,40,Good hotel on the beach,Stayed here recently for a long weekend. 30 mins from Faro airport. Sits above a beach which is great for ease of access. The hotel rooms were good and we had a sea view that didnt disappoint. The rooms are a little dated. Enjoyed a massage in the spa which was excellent. Sat by the pool and enjoyed looking out at the sea. Ate in the seafood restaurant which had amazing selection of fresh fish on the menu. Took the free hotel bus into Albufueira to see the old town. Overall a nice relaxing stay.
Jul 2016,50,A great family holiday,"We travelled as a large party of 8 with 6 adults, a 10 year old and an 18 month old. We all stayed in studios that are in the grounds away from the hotel. Studios were very clean and kitchenette had everything we needed. Had maid service with fresh towels everyday. We stayed half board. Breakfast was excellent. Lots of different choices. Hot food, fruit, yoghurts and pastries. Some of the party enjoyed a glass of champagne at breakfast. Dinner had different choices most nights, however if you have young children that can be fussy it may be worth talking to waiting staff if they can have something else. Staff are helpful in the restaurant, we had one waitress Elizabeth who was very friendly and efficient and provided a great service on our 14 nights. Our studio overlooked one of the pools. At the start of our holiday the pool was quiet and plenty sun loungers. Nearing the end of the holiday the pool became busier and sun loungers taken very quickly. We often went to the bars and staff there were very good and friendly, prices are what you expect for a hotel. Location of hotel is great. We used the shuttle bus to go to the Old town and the Strip and the beach at the hotel is excellent."
Jul 2016,10,terrible,"visited this hotel many times and did not expect cockroaches in the room, really dirty, don't go there.  the staff are not very friendly, all seem to be unhappy and the drinks are very expensive in the hotel."
Jul 2016,50,Beautiful ,"What a lovely hotel , it is located right on the beach. We stayed in a sea view suite. The hotel was clean and tidy, hotel staff were always willing to help. It's around 10 mins taxi ride to alberfura town which costs around 6 euros, however the hotel does offer a free bus to and from alberfura town several times a day which we found great. We will be returning!"
Jul 2016,30,Holiday with 6 year old twins,"As 5 star hotels go for family holidays, this one was surprisingly better than I expected. We booked via alpharooms and got a 'Seaview suite'. The room(s) were bigger than expected with a large king sized bed in one room with an ensuite and a sitting room with ensuite that converted into a double bed, for my 6 year old boys to sleep in. Each room had its own balcony(which were separated by a a wall for some reason. I assume at one point the rooms were separate given the ensuites). We had a pool/sea view on the 2nd floor and the room was very quiet. All in all a clean room but no bar facilities, the sofabed was not converted back  to a sofa once during our stay which I found odd for a '5 star' but didn't bother us. The walk way within the hotel was dark and dreary but other than that, the rest of the hotel is open, bright and impressive.There isn't much choice in terms of restaurants with a mediocre buffet most evenings at €30 a head and €15 for kids over 5 years old. The themes were Thai (ish) and Mediterranean on the nights we went. There are some restaurants belonged to the hotel, outside the beach gate which are ok. For choice, head to the old town in Albufeira which is <€10 in a taxi and takes 10 mins. The hotel also have a free bus every so often to/from the old town. There isn't much outside the hotel that is within walking distance. There is one small toddler pool which was too small for my 2 monkeys so we ended up buying arm bands and let them float around in the deep pool (there is one fresh water and one freezing salt water pool). They loved the pool and spend hours in it. The only criticism is there are no life guards, no pool service and on a number of the days there were very loud,boozing, military guys (a LOT of them) lounging around the pool taking a holiday on their way back from the Middle East to Canada. Whilst I have no issue with this, their behaviour was questionable in a 5 star hotel full of families- drinking in the pool, taking of prostitutes etc. They left after 3 days and the hotel for back to being nice and relaxing. The beach is nice and there seemed to be enough beds for everyone although you are charged for them as its a public beach also. Breakfast was included in the hotel price and it was a buffet with enough selection for us including gluten free options once we had informed the staff.There is a nice kids club with lots of staff. They have an indoor and outdoor area. The boys didn't want to stay there on their own and so when they wanted to play with the toys, we stayed with them. The hours and brief though and they close at 6pm every night. They offer babysitting but it's expensive. again, for a 5 star, I would have expected more activities for kids in the evening even to allow parents to enjoy a dinner alone for a night. All in all a nice holiday for one week. I would say the hotel is a good 4 star but could do more to meet the 5 star standard."
Jul 2016,10,Terrible ,"This hotel does not deserve to be a 5* hotel. Rooms and bathrooms badly need renovation and maintenance... We paid 180 euros per night, I would not pay more than 50 euros per night for such a poor room and service... Very disappointing!! The one and only good thing about it is that it has direct access to the beach..."
Jul 2016,50,Amazing,"Have just returned from our family holiday at this amazing place, our party ranged from 4 to 57 years & each one of us fell in love with the hotel immediately. On arrival the high level of service was clear, originally booked into 2 separate apartments/studios a distant away from each other it was made apparent they had changed this & accommodated us all together, which was much more convenient having young children in the group. The rooms were gorgeous with everything we could possibly need. The staff and level of service are impeccable, everyone so helpful, polite and welcoming. Truly have no negative comment to make & would highly recommend the Grande Real to anyone. Cannot wait to return."
Jul 2016,50,Beautiful and Relaxing,"I was really surprised at how awesome the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort was...especially for the great price!  It is beautiful!  Has lots of dining, pools and is situated right on the beach!  Our apartment was really cute with lots of space to relax in.  Seriously a great place to stay!"
Jul 2016,50,Great Hotel by the Beach,"Just returned from our second trip to this wonderful hotel. Rooms, staff, facilities and food all 5 star.  Planning to go back next year with our grown up family and grand daughter.  Something for everyone."
Jul 2016,40,Fabulous team ensures an amazing experience,Visited hotel for an industry hotel and the hotel team were amazing pulling out all the stops to ensure we understood their product offerThe food was amazing as were the numerous restaurant options on property
Jun 2016,50,Amazing Stay in June 2016,"Beautiful hotel, wonderfully furnished in a fantastic setting. We stayed there in June in a self catering apartment with our 4 year old. The bed was huge and comfy, kitchen had lots of great features and there was plenty of storage. We took the upstairs flat which was the best, the balcony was private unlike the downstairs apartments. TV in bedroom and living room, a safe and great room service. Maid comes in every day and does a brilliant job. We also had breakfast included. This was a buffet and just amazing- fruit and cereal for our little boy, fry-up for dad and a great selection of meats, cheeses, pastries, cakes and drinks. Eggs anyway you wanted them. We ate at the hotel a few times, it was a little expensive but great quality and well worth it. There were several places to eat, the places down by the beach were the best. Music in the evenings in the bars and the whole place was very relaxed and not over crowded. Great mix of people from all around the world, not dominated by one group which made the hotel seem very friendly. The staff were all very young but all very helpful- you can ask the desk staff anything and they will help you out and know the answer. If you don't want to eat at the hotel, there is an adequate restaurant just at the entrance, and its only 20 min walk to get into town. Cabs to the old town are cheap too. The extra few pounds was so worth it, for the peace, quiet and tranquillity."
Jun 2016,30,Loyal customers that won't return,"This was our final return to this hotel and resort. We didn't decide this until a few days into our holiday, but this now tired resort is beginning to let itself down.We were taken to our room with the usual pleasant service of golf buggy and friendly porter which cannot be faulted. The room was a 2 bed apartment which had accommodated our requests in the said area and even had a slight sea view if you stand up. It was room 268 resort apartment nearest the hotel, facing it and the pools.The maid service and cleanliness, as ever since we first arrived here in 2012/13 can not be faulted. Everything is left spotless and the maid service was friendly, efficient and well done, however there was one water mark on one of our toilets for over a week.There was one young and new maid who had just started and didn't speak any English that was grumpy, rude and wouldn't even look us in the eye which was disappointing. I hope she has left already! I can speak Portuguese and she ignored my every attempt to try be polite when she cleaned our room the odd day towards the end of our stay, early June.The communal areas look tired. the pools need the shower fixing, the decking to be re wood-stained; in fact my eldest isn't a tearaway and he suffered four splinters in his feet from the decking which hasn't been maintained since our first stay. The pool water, we never saw cleaned once in two weeks with exception of the kids pool which was drained once and only saw visible testing twice in 14days.The communal areas in the hotel are kept nice but a lot of the grass and plants in the grounds were far more tended to previously and the amount of rubbish and left over things around the pool areas lowered the tone of the hotel. Not 5 star. Stuff was sat around the pool for almost a week before anyone removed it; inflatables, toys, clothing etc.The main bar service was slightly more attentive but still not very swift, but this is a thing in Portugal generally. The drinks were overpriced. One customer interrupted our waiter service one night to ask for a drink and was served before our table of 6!The beach cafe staff were slightly more efficient and more pleasant. The kids club looked on par but my kids didn't use it this time.In our apartment we were pleased with the space but slightly disappointed with the facilities. Two chairs on the balcony for somewhere sleeping up to six. One had been stood through and broken and wasn't removed for three days.Showers had virtually no water pressure and bath looked old and tired. The dribble of water took me about 15m to wash myself and my long hair. The other shower cubicle had no lighting above it and the shower head was broken and the water simply trickled out of the head, not the holes and was more or less un usuable, so I had to bed over to wash my hair if I were to use this shower. Not what we anticipated. The third or so day into the holiday some of the wooden planks above the door outside had fallen to the ground. They all look old and rotten around the resort, with peeled varnish. They were attended to quickly, but I dread to think if they had fallen on any of my family's heads as another one was about to go after we noticed the first one.One or two nights the guests below our apartment were so disruptive I almost rang for security. They came in shouting, swearing, clattering and scraping chairs for a full 90 minutes at 2.30am and they weren't young folk either.The courtesy bus issues still exist as most people except British will not queue for the bus so a taxi is easier. The water fountains didn't work, people had no dress code etiquette within the main hotel and the whole place felt like it had lost its shine.Sadly, we will try somewhere else in our future stays in Portugal and despite a main hotel pool refurbishment coming up we would not want to return unless the whole thing was re vamped, sadly.Many Thanks,Gemma Stephenson"
Jun 2016,50,Beautiful hotel in a stunning location,"We stayed here for the first time in May and overall we were very impressed.The hotel is very good and the staff were fantastic.We came here for our friends wedding which was perfection and stayed for a week enjoying the sun. Whilst I thought this hotel was exceptional some silly things let it down,there are no facilities to make tea/coffee in your room,if you want an iron you have to hire it for 5 euros and the sun loungers really need  updating and the pool was pretty cold. However,it is a beautiful hotel with wonderful rooms and I would recommend it."
Jun 2016,50,Wonderful hotel,This was our third time returning to this hotel and this time we brought parents and siblings along. We all had a very pleasant stay and were very grateful that the hotel acknowledged that we were celebrating two birthdays and an anniversary whilst here. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful as usual and food was very good. Kids club is fantastic and our four year old was well looked after by the staff. Rooms are spacious and very clean. We would return again in a heartbeat!
Jun 2016,30,Very beautiful location but not all 5 star quality,"We had an apartment with our 2 year old, it was on the other side of the resort away from the hotel, the apartments were spacious but tired looking. The beds were very hard and the 'double bed' was two single beds pushed together. There were only two English channels none of which children's channels. There was a kettle in the apartment but not in the hotel room. The maid service was very good. Our parents had a sea view room which I definitely would recommend it was much more five star standard with a comfy king size bed and a luxury feel. The breakfast was dissapointing and not five star standard, there is only one tea/coffee machine and one toaster there was always queues. The cooked breakfast was reheated and not fresh they also ran out of food by 10am. The staff were not very friendly and you seated and served yourself. The burger restaurant had beautiful views but no children's menu. The atlantico resturant near the beach was the best food we had and very friendly staff, we ate there a few times for lunch and dinner. They serve a reduced menu after 6 and offer good alternatives to the expensive restaurants with beautiful views. The pool bar food was nice and they would bring it to the poolside. There was entertainment but no disco or children's entertainment and limited seating near the bar. The nearest shop is a five minute walk but the main strip of restaurants and shops was at least a 20 min walk up hill. The free shuttle bus was useful. The kids club was friendly and we stayed and played in there on occasions as they have lots of toys free to use. The wifi was inconsistent and came and went in different areas of the hotel. The beach was a short walk and very beautiful but only small there is lots of steps down to the beach and not very pushchair friendly."
Jun 2016,50,Beautiful Hotel and grounds.,"Just returned from a fantastic 2 week stay at this hotel we stayed in the apartments self catering. view was the car park but this didn't bother us as there was gardens in front of terrace. Furniture could do with a bit of an update and chairs on terrace were broken. This however did not spoil our stay at this resort. Plenty of pools and loungers and never to busy. would of been nice if the pool bar was open, but having apartment near by meant just nipping in when needing drinks or snacks. Only downside was price of breakfast at 20 euro very overpriced but if you go down the road you can get this for only 3,50 euro and doesn't matter what time. I would stay here again and would recommend the apartments for family's and couples and we found everything was close by. The hotel also offers a free shuttle bus to the strip and old town. the beach is just the other side of the hotel and is beautiful."
Jun 2016,20,"4* Facilites, 2* Service & 7* Prices","I am sorry to say this was our last visit. I have reviewed this Hotel several times on Trip Advisor and we only recently stayed at Christmas this year. The hotel is in a perfect location, so... if you can stand Kids running around in every area of the Hotel including Breakfast, Pool Area, Reception, Bar Area, Bar Terrace then you will love this Hotel. My wife & I used to love this Hotel because it was quiet and calm with Business People and Couples, however the demographic has changed and they obviously have a new philosophy... fill the hotel at all costs! The Service here has never been great, but it is now painful! At breakfast they have introduced ONE coffee machine! and they have obviously directed the staff to direct all customers towards it. Fortunately one of the breakfast staff recognised us from our many previous visits and served us with a pot of fresh coffee and warm milk. He will remain nameless in case he gets into trouble, but i cannot thank him enough. As for the other guests they queued up at the ONE coffee machine and were served weak Douwe Egberts Coffee! Really! in the home of DELTA.One evening the noise from the kids was so bad my wife and I decided to go back up to the room and read on the Balcony... So, I went to the Bar and asked for 4 bottles of beer and a bucket of ice. I was refused and offered a small glass of Ice! I was astonished... I complained at the Bar and reception and was told thats the rules! I didn't spend another penny in the Hotel for the next 5 days and purchased everything we needed from the local Intermarché. If we hadn't booked the hotel as a package and were prepaid we would have checked out. In summary, the hotel now appears to cater for anyone that will fill it. This may seem an odd statement to make because they are a business. But, if you have stayed at this Hotel in the Past then you can tell the difference in the guests.Shame, but we have found a new Hotel... Sao Rafael Atlantico will now be getting my several thousand euros each year!."
Jun 2016,50,A fabulous holiday in a gorgeous hotel !,"The five star hotel lived up to its star rating ; we had a suite with a living room two bathrooms large bedroom and a balcony off each room with gorgeous view off two salt water pools and sea in the backround!There was a little fridge in each room and two huge wardrobes and immaculate surroundings.Each day when the maids had been there was a little chocolate by your pillow and in each bathroom a selection of mini soaps , shower gels and body lotions as well as a mini manicure set .The hotel staff were lovely and can not do enough for you .The breakfast was buffet style with anything you wanted from full English Breakfast to continental style, fruit and pastries and even champagne in a bucket of ice if you fancied that champagne breakfast!There was a courtesy bus to take you to the Albufeira town if you fancied it.Really enjoyed our holiday there and would recommend!"
Jun 2016,50,5 star hotel - 5 star beach - 5 star team ( relaxed and friendly ) and the DJ is great !,A truly lovely hotel that caters for all in a no fuss 5 star way - it's a calm oasis with an amazing beach and great amenities . A free hotel bus takes is on hand to take you to Albuferia - and local buses stop outside the gate. At times it felt like we could have been anywhere in the Caribbean - we had a sea view room - the room was very large and had amazing air con and most importantly - so quiet . Music is laid on most nights and gives the resort a lovely laid back feel . Great choice of restaurants - and the White Sangria in Atlantico is a must - as are the crepes . We had a magical 8 days - even got a full moon  over the bay - weather was amazing !
Jun 2016,50,Great family break,Had a fantastic break at this timeless gem in santa eulalia. Great hotel facilities and beach 100 yds in front of you. Very clean and loads of staff on hand to deal with anything and everything you ask of them. Will be back for sure
Jun 2016,50,Little paradise in Algarve,Santa Eulaia is secluded and has a lovely beach and the has a strawberry milkshake packed with fresh strawberries and tastes delicious every time we go to the Algarve which is 5 times now we always spend a day or two going Santa Eulalia even if we stay at 5* Resorts such as Villa Golfe
Jun 2016,50,Worth the price,"We stayed there 4 nights with a 7 month old baby, they provided a cot which was very comfortable for my daughter. Although resort advertises 6 restaurants but only 3 were open in second week of May and rest were due to open end May or early June when it's considered busy. Very clean rooms, good pools for both adults and children. 20 mins walk to the main strip.  The only negative was delivery charge for food, if you order food to your apartment from the hotel restaurants within the resort there is a 10 euro delivery charge."
Jun 2016,40,Scuba Experience by the pool,"Very relaxed hotel at a good standard with all the amenities you would want. If you have ever wanted to try your hand at scuba diving then here's your chance. A local experienced instructor visits on Tuesday's and offers 'try lessons' for €15 for an hours trial, and further lessons if you wish. We tried it as it was something I needed to tick off the bucket list, and it was fantastic. The instructor was very relaxed and his teaching method second to none, all in the safety of the hotel pool."
Jun 2016,30,Just Ok definitely not 5 Star,"We stayed there for four nights, the rooms were clean but need updating, sea view room we booked but our view was the car park and staff completely not interested in helping when i left my bag at pool bar, while it was my fault that I left it behind staff informed me that the bar was closed and i could get my bag with novel, just thirty pages to finish...aagggh in the morning when it opened at ten the next morning. However I explained that we were leaving at seven it was a shrug of the shoulders and sorry. One Girl said that she would send on the items took email address and contact number but still waiting for that call"
Jun 2016,40,Second visit to Grande Real,It's a lovely Hotel .We are staying self catering this visit accomodation is great.Only draw back it has become very expensive. For instance Breakfast per person 20.00 euro.In my opinion not worth it as it's self service.
Jun 2016,50,"Dream Getaway, Perfect!","What a find, I am so glad I booked here. I booked this after reading the reviews left on here and seeing how happy everyone was, so I feel I too need to contribute to tell you, you need to book this place if you are coming to albufeira. Here is why....Check in was swift, we even got taken over in a golf buggy to our apartment. Nice touch. Apartment was spotlessly clean and comfortable! although I would next time only book to stay inside the hotel. My reason for this is because there is absolutely no sound proofing at all, I was woken up at various times from loud neighbours. If you chose an apartment ask for upstairs, we had a downstairs and the outside balcony for us is open to the neighbours too, we had chairs taken daily, and even came home one day for find ALL of it gone, that's right, table and chairs all on next doors balcony. We only ended up with 1 back as it seems someone had fallen through the chair breaking it, so yes of course we can now have it. Cheeky. That isn't the hotels thought though, just consider that when booking an apartment. We wanted to go on a lot of excursions around town and didn't know how to get about and have a very limited Portuguese understanding, so we went to reception, they helped us tremendously booking our taxis transfers and tickets to places such as zoo marine, boat tours, and jeep safaris. Nothing was too much hassle. Everything was smooth, and I am so grateful that they helped so much to make my holiday so special. Breakfast is ok.... About what I expect from a hotel, so I really have no complaints. They have a lot of people of different nationalities to cater for, so you need to understand this when you eat there. The food is nice, just repetitive. We ate in the gourmet burger restaurant twice, both times tasty, great chips. We sat in the bar for a few of our evenings there, great cocktails, great service too, free crisps and nuts. Live music most evenings, who are extremely good, very talented and easy to listen too. The views from the bar area are breathtaking. A short walk to the beach which is through a secure gate is lovely, and peaceful. We even got a swim lots in the outdoor pool, it was mostly empty with lots of vacant sun loungers, we loved this. A nice dip every afternoon to cool down with hardly anyone else there. I think we were lucky as there was a conference going on all week so probably less holiday makers than normal, and it was just before the busy season hits. But we chose our week well as we really had free reign (or so it felt) of the hotel. So in summary.... Definitely book here, everyone is friendly, will go above and beyond, food is good, drinks are good (just remember it's a 5* so you will pay more) it really was a luxury break with absolutely nothing I could complain about. BOOK NOW and FAST. Then sit back and enjoy the best holiday of your life."
Jun 2016,50,Great place ,"We been there two times in last 3 years. A great place to visit. Right on the beach, very good service and food. We will visit again. Rooms are good too, room with sea view was perfect. On beach restaurant is handy too. Nothing negative to say. Looking forward to our next stay at the hotel."
Jun 2016,50,Fabulous holiday,We spent a wonderful week in this gorgeous hotel. The rooms were spacious and very clean. The staff were very helpful and nothing was a bother.  Loved the hot water and sea water pools. The whole experience was great and we hope to visit again very soon
Jun 2016,30,Room for improvement,"Very poor arrival preparation room was incorrect for booking and took over an hour to resolve.  Room eventually allocated was clean but clearly needed redecorating / updating.Sea view only partial and overpriced compared to other hotels previously stayed in other countries.Very professional 1st impression of hotel when you walk in the front entrance is not backed up with the service levels.Staff generally unwelcoming apart from bar and pool bar. Struggled to even get a good morning and clearly need some basic customer service skills development.  Conferences and wedding on all week resulting in areas and restraunts beung unavailable, felt like the remaining hotel  guests were a distraction and the staff were doing a favour by helping them.WiFi service very poor.Food quality was good but the restraunt cost were overpriced £33.09 each for a buffet!  Bar food cost comparable to UK.Great coastline and weather was the only highlight.Certainly not a 5 star hotel more like a 3/4 star anywherw else, unless this is comparing only local hotels if this is the case I would not like to stay at non-5 star hotels in the region.A trip to the old town on the free bus service was helpful however sadly the old town has been spoilt terribly.  unless you want rows of bars and cheap cafe's spend another day elsewhere."
Jun 2016,40,Good family break,Enjoyed our stay in hotel. Rooms somewhat dated but spotless. Reception staff extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was 4 star only choices good but would benefit from omelette perhaps. Fruit choices could be improved also. The hotel had great access to wonderful beach.
Jun 2016,40,Lovely hotel but basic for a 5 star,"Had 4 days here in June and enjoyed, very clean and pool areas nice, but thought it lacked extra touches that you would receive at other 5 star properties across Europe.Food was good but breakfast wasnt great...service and staff very good."
Jun 2016,50,Amazing Holiday! Will Go Back,"We travelled here in May 2016 for a family holiday, wife, 2 year old daughter, and myself. We booked a one bedroom Resort apartment, half board. Arrival and checkin was easy and fast. If your accommodation if not in the hotel itself (ie the apartments) then you get driven in a golf cart, even though it was only 100 yards from reception. Thought that was a nice touch. When arrived at the apartment, was pleased, and everything was clean and tidy. Nice terrace that looked onto two of the pools. The main bedroom had two singles pushed together rather than a double. Cot was also in the main bedroom. Bathroom and living area were both large and very good. The kitchen was adequate with plenty of utensils etc. No washing up liquid though. In the main living area there was also a double sofa bed, so plenty of room if there is more than 3 of you. The pool areas were immaculate and the heated outdoor pool was a big hit. Pool side bar was good too. Access to the beach was easy and the beach was amazing. The hotel provides free beach\pool towels to use. Best to go to the beach mid morning or late afternoon as the tide is out, and when tide is in, the beach can be cramped. The kids playground and kids club were amazing. Very well organised and lots for kids to do. Kids under three years old cannot be enrolled into kids club, so parents have to stay with the under 3s. Food was good. We wasn't a fan of the evening buffet though as not much for kids. So, if you are half board, you can use your voucher at lunch instead. And that was amazing food, off the menu, and also a kids menu too. This was best decision we made all week. The hotel has 5 star rating and overall I would agree, but I think this only applies to the hotel rooms. Apartments would may be 3-4 star. We are going to go back next year but will be staying in hotel room, not apartment."
Jun 2016,30,Very disappointed ,"Went for a week at the end of May. The hotel is of 5 star quality as are some of the staff, but after that it's somewhat 'downhill'! The overriding impression was the hotel was 'a little bit up itself' to coin a phrase. This may be due to the lack of 5* competition, but it doesn't provide the level of service expected. A couple of examples to illustrate my point. One evening we ordered a small bottle of water, but they delivered a large one as there was none smaller. No problem, we would return the following evening with it to dinner. Wrong!!!  We were told that nothing could leave the dining room and nothing could enter it. We made the point it was their fault and it was grudgingly conceded by the maitre de....but not without on going  resentment for the rest of the week!! The hotel clearly values its conference guests, who attend Friday and Saturday, way above the others. When they have their lunch outside the other inmates/guests are kept well away and the exclusion is a tad uncomfortable. Been on previous 5* hotel deals with Jet2.Com and it was superb. This hotel could learn a great deal from the Raddison Sun Gardens in Dubrovnik.Left a bit of a taste, given the propensity to rudeness by some of the staff. There are others who are sweethearts and it is of high quality.....just not 5* all issues considered."
Jun 2016,40,10 fantastic days,"The entrance and lobby of this hotel are quite impressive with lots of parking and small water feature outside and lots of room and seating inside. It is a resort with hotel and lots of apartments. The room was dark with blackout blinds which were great and massive bed which was comfy and clean. A/C with usual noise worked well. The bathroom was fine with usual facilities. A small fridge was available but no tea making facilities and no iron. An iron could be hired for €5 a day. We passed on that. There was a bottle of water free on day one only. The tv had a mind of its own with 2 English speaking news channels only.. Cleaning and bed linen was spotless and efficiently carried out every day.The location on the beach is great. There was no problem getting sunbeds at one of the pools at any time of the day. The free gym was great with the spa being lovely if more than a little overpriced. There are lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance, provided you are willing to hill-walk on cobbles for 20 mins each way. Taxis are a must for ladies in heels or the elderly. They are quite reasonably priced.The staff members were, like most Portuguese hotel staffs, mannerly, personable, well presented, well spoken with multi lingual skills and sharp sense of humour. The lifts worked perfectly...fast and quiet.The breakfast was great with massive choice of healthy and other foods. Dinner was much cheaper in some lovely local restaurants.Wi fi is freely available and worked very well inside the building.I would recommend this hotel but the hillwalking and a few of the above small issues mean I would think twice about returning myself."
Jun 2016,50,Excellent ,"Have had an amazing week in this stunning resort with my husband and two young boys. The apartment is immaculate, cleaned every day. There are plenty of activities to occupy children in the kids club. The beach is a few mins walk and there are lots of pools to choose from. We found the staff to be very friendly, extremely polite and helpful. Our little boys favourite blanket/comforter got mixed up in the bedding and we lost it to the laundry service and they managed to have it back to us the next day! We have eaten in the buffet restaurant and the food was lovely with lots of choice. We can't wait to come back here, have loved every minute of our stay."
Jun 2016,50,Week relaxing,"Hotel modern and clean. 1bedroom apartment with everything we needed. Staff very helpful and all spoke good English. Good choice of bars and restaurants serving good food and not to expensive. Pool area large with bar serving food and drink all day. Access down onto a nice beach with plenty of activities going on and a bar and restaurant. Altogether a good place to stay, only down side just a bit isolated but free bus laid on every day at various times"
May 2016,50,Albufeira Ace,Good Quality Hotel on the beach excellent breakfast(buffet) staff very helpful at all times.Just outside Albufeira but free bus into Old and New TownNo need to take beach towels these are provided free every day.Ask at reception for a kettle and cups/saucers if you want a brew as these are not in the rooms.Plenty of good restaurants a short walk away if you don't want to eat on site(expensive).
May 2016,50,Excellent for Family holidays,"This hotel is very suitable for family holidays, especially if travelling with young children.  The amenities, service and food are of a high standard.  We had all evening meals in the self service buffet and the variety of food available was suitable for most  tastes.  I imagine that it gets very crowded in peak season times but during our May visit there were ample sun loungers and meal times were comfortable.  Access to the beach is gently sloping but if you have a wheelchair you need to explore the routes to avoid the steps.  The beach was clean with life  guards in attendance.Issues:  Make sure you get the room booked ask for a quiet location if you need it although the hotel was very quiet at all times during our 10 day stay.We thought that there was a need for pool sunbed attendants to be patrolling to make sure that standards and safety  are maintained in all of the many areas surrounding the many pools..Make sure that you do not lose you tokens for the towels they will try and charge you E15 if you loose one, even if there is proof that have returned all towels allocated.  Make sure that you receive the tokens when returning the towels.Also on arrival we required some milk for a baby and were charged E2 for about a third of a baby's bottle.  So go to the local mini-market about 5 minutes walk from the entrance to the hotel.  Thee larger Inter \Marche store is on the outskirts of Town about 15 minutes walk (taxi costs about E3 and is worth it.  A very good hotel, spotlessly clean and with good service from all the extremely polite , we recommend for an off peak stay, especially for families.staff.Ground floor resort view rooms look onto car park, the upper rooms have the same view but the views are better, sea view room will be hotter.  Some apartments are close to a busy road check location when booking in."
May 2016,20,"Zero ""glamour""","A big hotel complex near the beach. It pretends to be luxury, but service and facilities at the level of a basic 3-star hotel.The location is in a very touristic area with good sea views (part of the rooms).Massive breakfast room with reasonable quality but very uncomfortable.If you look for peace... this is not your place, I am afraid. You need to fight to get your food and the servers will take even a bottle of water from your table because you need to get only small glass after small glass..."
May 2016,50,Stayed there for our Silver Wedding Anniversary 24/5/16 for 4 days Robert& Wendy Smith South Wales,"Got to Resort, Staff Brilliant at Check in, booked a deluxe room requested a seaview.At check in, gave us a free upgrade to a suite with full sea view and pool view ,absolutely fantastic view, also a free bottle of Champagne on ice as it was our Wedding anniversary. Suite was immaculate only negative was there are no Tea/ Coffee making facilities in the room .Was on a bed and breakfast basis, breakfast excellent plenty of choice(Buffet Breakfast) everything was fresh, loved the fruit, and staff very polite and helpful.Pool area very clean as was the whole complex, pool though a bit cold found it very refreshing . Staff were very friendly all the food made fresh, not cheap ,but quality as it is in all the other Restaraunts on the complex .Beach 2 minutes walk free towels in reception if required, nice break from the pool lovely beach especially in the morning when tide was out only negative no sunbeds or chairs .Checkout is at 12 which is a nice time our pick up was not till 7pm secure place for our luggage, and use of the Spa showering Facilities to shower etc before leaving with free towels.Just to summarise Fantastic Hotel, Staff cant do enough for you special mention to Sophia on reception who was fantastic even though she was in her training, was brilliant and very helpful.Cant wait to go back ,and will go back for longer next time MANY THANKS FOR A FANTASTIC BREAK AND YOU MADE OUR SILVER WEDDING ANNIVERSARY EXTRA SPECIAL."
May 2016,50,Relaxing break ,"If you are after a relaxing break in the sun then you cannot go wrong with this hotel and this location. We stayed in one of the apartments. Huge king size bed, fully equipped kitchen and a generous sized bathroom. We were very happy with the accomodation. The breakfast in the hotel was good, with the best fresh orange juice I've ever tasted. We went to the hotels fish restaurant, twice..good on both occasions. The service all of the hotel staff provided was exemplary.Beautiful beach at the back of the hotel, (apart from the sea which was on the chilly side ;-))Overall we had a lovely relaxing stay here. I recommend it"
May 2016,40,Self Catering,"We stayed in one of the self catering sections and was absolutely fantastic. The staff couldn't do enough for you, and very friendly. We had a trip out to Lisbon from the hotel which was well organised and enabled you to have time on your own to explore."
May 2016,50,Amazing ,"Stayed for 1 week here in a villa/bungalow. Beautifully situated on the beach front with plenty of pools, bars and restaurants. Staff drive you around so no need to walk with cases etc. Staff were so helpful and nice. Located about a 10/15 minute walk from the new town (about 4 euro in a taxi). And a very long walk to old town (10 euro in a taxi). Room was very spacious, kitchen had everything you would need. Bed is so comfy and absolutely huge!! Would 100% return. Very secure with security gates in and out. Amazing views from the terrace."
May 2016,50,Relaxing break,"Comfortable apartments ,large comfy beds, nothing too much trouble so clean and nice extras like toiletries,safe,dressing gowns and beach towels ,would definitely return,gardens and pool areas so clean and accessible"
May 2016,30,"5 Star - You're having ""larf""","My wife and i stayed half board at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa from the 8th to 19th May inclusive. To say it is classed as 5 star is well overstated. However there are some good points about it. Most of the staff we met were very polite and helpful. We found the food in the main restaurant to be of an excellent standard with ample choice. When dishes were running low they were quickly replenished. Generally all the waiting staff were very efficient. Queuing could occur both at breakfast and the evening meal, thus it was best to arrive at opening time. The resort covers a vast area and there are sufficient pools scattered round, ideal for families with young children. There is an excellent long beach which appears to be used mainly by the guests, although the car park can get relatively full on weekends by locals.NOW SOME OF THE BAD AND GENERAL POINTS.  There doesn't seem to be any rule re men's evening dress for the evening meal, people wearing shorts were noticed and even someone wearing a cap. One lady asked at reception what was the dress etiquette and the receptionist laughed and said there isn't one. One evening a child came whizzing round the restaurant on a balance bike. On the first 3 nights we walked out without being asked to sign for the wine that we had, and thought surely how do you make sure you only pay for what you have consumed. The FOURTH night we had got to the lift and a waiter had chased me to sign the slip!!! No standards obviously applied throughout.  There was no coffee or tea making facilities in the room, and only the one initial bottle of water. The carpet had quite a number of large stains where the colour had come out, and i mean large. The wash basin wasn't washed once, proof a coffee stain from a cup was there throughout our stay. I even thought the bathroom floor wasn't cleaned. A lady on leaving the restaurant asked for the baby's bottle to be filled with milk - FOR WHICH SHE WAS CHARGED!!  As we were experiencing bad weather after 4 days i decided to go in the indoor pool and to my amazement was told there is a charge to use it as it is connected to the Spa. I found out later the minimum charge was 19 Euros per hour and 3 Euros for a cap. On arrival we had only 6 clothes hangers in the wardrobe and had to go to reception to ask for more. Another couple who had a larger room than us only had 4 hangers and on asking got the extra quantity they requested. THEN the same number again! For the first 3 nights there was no entertainment, but the next 4 there was entertainment. The 8th night the same sequence started. The leaflet they hand you states newspapers and magazines are available in the boutique. This was not the case and the nearest shop selling them was down near the beach. To go to the beach a gate has to be opened with the same pass used for your room door. Supposedly to stop no residents entering the grounds. Once through the gate there is the Atlantico restaurant - bar. This is also owned by the hotel group but to say have a glass of wine here costs 3 Euros and within the grounds doubles to 6 Euros. ODD!! Our room overlooked the car park which wasn't the best of views and on the friday when we got back in a coach parked in front of our window. We put up with this until Sunday morning when i went to complain at reception to be told it will move during the day. Late afternoon it was still there so another walk to reception this time told ""I will see what i can do"".  After our evening meal there were 2 COACHES. If still there in the morning i was going to ""HIT THE FAN"". Fortunately they left early for good. I took photos with and without them being there. Some guests probably didn't understand what 5 stars means as they straggled themselves about on the furniture.We must have spoken to 6 English couples who felt it was nowhere near 5 star. When i was having the bill for extras printed out a lady who must have only arrived a short while ago barged up to reception complaining in a loud voice. Saying i have paid for a 5 star hotel and it's nowhere near 5 star, in fact it is nearer 3. The room is outdated, too small and overlooks a car park. There is no tea/coffee making facilities, and she went on and on for ages.Fortunately we tend to go out everyday which helped to forget such as the above. However the terrain outside the hotel is not brilliant for anyone with a walking disability, and it is up hill down dale. There is the hotel courtesy bus to Albufeira but we used taxis as the escalators were usually broken down. There are not many shops or restaurants close by.In conclusion we have been in much better 4 star hotels and the odd 3 star."
May 2016,40, Beautiful Wedding,Just returned from the wedding of Jolene and Jim at the Grande Real hotel. Stunning setting .the wedding planner was amazing. The meal was beautiful. The  bride was absolutely gorgeous. We had an amazing time.our apartment was lovely the house keeper was great.only negative was drinks  and food overpriced in hotel .would benefit from a little supermarket .tv no English  channels. We had a ball .thank you lovely staff .nothing to much trouble. Looking forward to returning. this was our second visit .the best.
May 2016,50,PERFECT!!!,"Only home from a glorious weeks stay at our favourite hotel we go every year sometimes twice.  This year we noticed the hotel had updated some decor and furniture , as alway our accommodation was of a high standard and the cleaning standard excellent.  All off the hotel staff are welcoming and frendly - the club cars are great for getting around, we only discovered the Real Bar served food on the last day and it was by far the best menu to suit my taste. The evening entertainment was exactly that entertaining - a big fuss can be made over a room with a sea view but we always stay in one bed aprt with garden views they are very spacious with seperate bedroom  and the add on of a reat wee kitchen.  Will we we back..... ? Oh yes see you next year Grand Real xxxx"
May 2016,50,Enjoyable stay,"A fab 5 star!! A real little haven away from the hustle and bustle of hen & stag territory of new town Albufeira.. We had a pleasant stay here beginning of May, could not fault the hotel in any way. The staff are so helpful and pleasant, stayed in one bed apartment overlooking lovely well maintained gardens. We moved into the hotel for the last 3 days of our stay due to an issue with the hot water in the apt, we were given a suite!!!!!Lovely pool area with private access to beach, lovely restaurant and spoiled rotten with the choice offered at the breakfast buffet. Would love to return in the future. Well run beautiful complex, would highly recommend."
May 2016,40,Excellent Hotel but very expensive,"We stayed for 11 nights in a suite which whilst a little dated was very clean, tidy and spacious. Beautiful view from the large balconies and the bed was enormous and very comfortable. The maids did a fantastic job of cleaning every day and took real pride in their work. All the staff were very helpful and we were B and B and the breakfasts had a great choice as you would expect with the food of a very high quality. The only downside was the price of food and drink in the hotel. It was almost treble what you paid just a mile down the road in the town itself. I would return."
May 2016,40,Mr,"Fantastic hotel with a private beach to explore. The only reason I have not rated it as a 5 is this. Drinks of any kind in the hotel are at least double to anywhere else which is a shame. 5/6 drinks of Pepsi by the pool will cost £20 and let's face it, in one days lounging around the pool your going to drink a hell of a lot more than 5/6 Pepsi and if your here with a family it would get ridiculous. Walk out of the hotel you pay €2 for a big beer and €1:50 for 2ltre of water. They will charge you €4 for a bottle of water in the hotel. If on average the price was similar everywhere it wouldn't bother me. It's the fact the gap is so big in the prices which just makes you feel cheated!  that's so annoying! I stayed here for 2weeks and I will say I had a lovely time. There's lots to do in and around the hotel. Restaurant and bars everywhere. Don't eat in the hotel restaurant, again it's an area that is poor. Average buffet style food €32 a head and you pay for your drinks. Local restaurants are serve awesome food for €15.Fantastic place but don't eat and drink in the hotel"
May 2016,40,"Very nice hotel/appartment, but not sure about quality of pool water","We have enjoyed a great short trip at the Grande Real Santa Hotel. We had a very nice, clean and spacious 2 bed room apartment with a nice garden view. The Kids Club was great. My 2 children were really enjoying this kids club with great and enthousiastic 'teachers'. The location was also great, you easily walk to the beach with superb views! Only thing that was not so great was that we returned home with 2 sick children with double ear and throat infection ; most likely caused by polluted swimming water (the doctor told us). They are now on antibiotics, but I think it would be necessary the hotel will double check the water quality on a (more) frequent basis. Especially as only one pool was heated and this pool was therefor very crowded."
May 2016,20,5 Star Hotel?? Ok if you say so,"It´s being a very disappointing experience here at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa. This was a last minute reservation but once we arrived at the room the Internet connection is...""it has ceased to be...it´s expired and gone to meet it´s maker....this is a late internet...this is an ex-internet"" it´s non-existing on a 5 Start Resort?!? and the solution can only be solved with an authorization of a hotel director to allow a router to be putted in the rooms (we have 2 rooms in different places at the hotel) it´s a disgrace and if you have a business to run at distance with constant emails you better bring a gun and shot yourself...Also pools needed to be bigger for the amount of guests (it´s May and it´s crowded imagine in August) the staff on the other hand...5 Star category i´m a Hilton Silver member so i´m very disappointed (or pissed off to say the least) even this review took me 20 min just to put it online :S P.S.- the carpets also need some refurbishing"
May 2016,50,1 Week family holiday 2 bed apartment,"Had the good fortune of staying at this hotel for a week early May.  2 adults and 2 children.  We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment close to the main hotel.  It was very nice, spacious, comfortable and spotless.  The entire resort is incredibly clean.  The pools are great and the food is good too.  We dined at the beachfront bar most evenings and it really is perfect for family and not too expensive.  The closest supermarket is about 5 mins in a taxi €3;50 or so away and was able to stock up on the essentials for the apartment for the week.  The hotel operates a free shuttle bus to and from Albufeira a few times every day.  A very nice scenic beach below the hotel and really nice to go for a stroll at low tide. I really couldnt fault a single thing with this resort,  really enjoyed it and I do hope to return.  Free wifi in the apartments also and the main hotel.  Supervised playground,  with activities for the little ones.  Perhaps the hotel could consider a bolt high up on the doors of the first floor apartments to stop small kids opening the door.  As you can see from the pics,  we moved a cabinet in front of the door to stop the 2yr old exploring the steps outside."
May 2016,50,"Great hotel, great stay","This is a great hotel for families. We travelled (2+2, kids aged 5 and 3) in early May and with the weather not being great this holiday could have been a disappointment. Not so with this hotel though. From the moment we arrived with a buggy ride to the apartment, we could not have been better looked after. Staff were great, in a friendly and understated manner. They are happy to arrange day trips or just assist with anything. We had a 2 bed apartment and it was very spacious with 2 bathrooms, large living space and a balcony. Could easily sleep 6. The apartments are immaculately kept and cleaned spotlessly each day by the friendly maid service. The resort itself is so good you barely need to leave although the hotel runs a bus to Albufeira regularly each day. There are 5 pools, one heated which was a godsend with the kids. The pools are well maintained and the pool area is well kept and spacious. The beach is a matter of meters away and stunning. Between the excellent main restaurant (great buffet food - all food very fresh and different every night, try lunch which is awesome), pergula burger restaurant as well as other snacks there is plenty of options. I had read some reviews that breakfast and dinner can lead to queues at the restaurant, not so for us as we were always looked after very well. This seems to only be an issue for anyone arriving at the last minute for breakfast before it finishes. The bar and foyer are excellent for coffee or a drink while looking out at the sea.... The kids club was excellent and well staffed, understandably in May they close earlier but in high season open til 10pm! There is also entertainment many nights in the bar. The games room could do more given this is such a family friendly location but there is a pool table and table tennis table off the foyer. There is also an excellent spa and well equipped gym. We stayed for 9 nights and would have loved to stay longer. Would love to return with a bit of better weather... We met a number of families saying the same, hope prices don't go up! Albeit I didn't rate Albufeira town highly (stag and hen central!!!) this is a fantastic value 5 star hotel excellent for families, go if you can..."
May 2016,50,A lovely hotel for a short break,A lovely hotel which we stayed in for 3 nights.The staff were polite and friendly and the hotel was very clean everywhere at all times.The rooms were perfect and the food was great with enough choice.The gym was one of the best we have used on holiday and the therapy pool was perfect especially for my husbands back. For hygiene reasons special caps have to be worn (not waterproof) but its not a big deal as everyone has to wear them unless you are bald I think. I had a wonderful back massage during my stay. I didn't want it to end. The bus takes you into town for free or the cabs are quite cheap. Overall a wonderful break and we would return.
May 2016,40,Wonderful setting,Stayed for 8 nights with hubby and booked an apartment. The pros were:Beautiful settingPlenty of spacePeacefulHousekeeping every dayVery clean with immaculate grounds Polite and friendly staffBeach towels every day10 min walk to amenitiesThe cons were:Needs slight refurbishing as rooms looking a little tired to keep 5 stars Expensive to eat in resort restaurantsNeed solutions for guests when it's a 'rainy day'Could benefit from onsite supermarketOnly two restaurants open in resort in May Need to sell resort and amenities on offer to guests moreWould definitely stay again and enjoyed 8 days of relaxation
May 2016,30,good and bad points,"nice place and not the worst hotel i have ever stayed in, very friendly staff and only a 20 min walk from the main strip of montechoro or 5 euros in a cab each way. i stayed in the main building, not an apartment, had a semi sea view and the rest was non overlooked and surrounded by trees. my room was very spacious, couldn't get the telly to work.however, in my research i never noticed a fee to use the spa (which was the main reason i chose this hotel) also if you decide to pay a fee to use it you have to wear a swimming cap. also i could smell cigarette smoke all the way to my room from entering the hotel and my room had been smoked in by the previous guest. on asking the maid told me that the management do not enforce the no smoking laws in their rooms, if like me you do not like to smell it you will be disappointed as the halls stink when the maids have the door open for cleaning as you pass by."
May 2016,30,Not a real 5*,"Have just arrived back from the Grande Real, the hotel states it's a 5* the main hotel could be the staff are very helpful & attentive. The apartments however are dated & in need of major refurbishment. Green & orange decor old furniture. Nothing 5* about them at all. Spotlessly clean- the staff are very good. The ant infestation in the apartment was too much to bare in the end.The pool bar is very expensive almost €20 for 4 small drinks & two ice creams, we didn't even try the inside bar or the restaurant due to the prices.Down on the beach front the 'restaurant' which I'm not sure may not belong to the hotel, is more of a cafe or cookhouse nothing very appetising. The beach however is stunning, beach towels provided by the hotel on a daily basis. No 'supermarket' near only on the free bus ride not very helpful with so many self catering apartments."
May 2016,40,5 star hotel ,"We got a really good deal on this hotel in April for a weeks stay. We was expecting the hotel to be more of a four star however the hotel was lovely and was very much a 5 star hotel. On my birthday the hotel left a bottle of bubbly and a cake in our room it was a really lovely touch thank you :) the only things that were disappointing was that it was too expensive to eat in the hotel, very over priced. And during our weeks stay there was only entertainment on 2 nights, as a five star hotel I expected entertainment every night. This didn't ruin the holiday in anyway though and we would defiantly return. Also the the man that took our cases to our room for us and gave us a lift in the buggy is a credit to the hotel, he was very friendly and professional."
Apr 2016,40,Overall Very Good......,"Just returned  from just over a 2 week stay using their conference facilities to hold 3 conferences. The hotel technically was out of season as the beach etc was just being set up for the May / June rush. Some of the areas could do with a lick of paint to bring them up to scratch but generally pool areas were spotless. Lovely staff who work as a lot of hotel people do tirelessly. The beach is lovely and at low tide you can walk around to the next beach etc. Sorry to say that the town for me was horrible - full of sports bars catering for tourists, found it hard locally to find Portugal !. A couple of things about my 2 bed / 2 bathroom apartment with kitchen / lounge / dining area - the hotel supplied a kettle but you do not get any coffee / tea which seemed rather odd for a 5 star and the other annoying thing (not for me as i have a European plugged iron) for some people they will charge you to hire an iron - again not 5 star standards. One of the people attending a conference wanted a green tea bag from the bar and they wanted to charge her €1.50 - again i find that not 5 star service but 5 star prices. But overall i mention a few negatives the rest was all positive, and i hope to return next year for another few weeks - though i shall remember to take a jar of coffee :)"
Apr 2016,40,"Fantastic hotel, not quite 5 Star","We had a fantastic holiday. There are very few hotels in a better location and that is what made our holiday so great.Still a few touches missing for the 5 Star standard.We stayed in a one bedroom apartment, there was no tea, coffee, milk in the room, just a bottle of complimentary water and the usual bathroom bits. Disappointing as we arrived very late. It was seen a a bit of a joke that there was a bird perched on the smoke alarm outside our room but the piles of pooh were never cleared properly so you had to be a bit careful getting in and out of the room.The bathroom layout means there isn't enough room to actually use the bidet and not enough toilet roll was left each day.The apartments can be rather noisy.In reception there were two large vases of fading flowers that were not changed for the 7 days we were there.Some staff were friendly but despite still being quiet the service was slow.All in all it was the little touches that keep it from being 5 Star.If you find a ""good deal"" grab it and hopefully you'll have a great holiday as we didi"
Apr 2016,10,"Rude attitiude of ""duty manager"" Jao..","FAO: Jorge Teixeira General Manager Hotel is great for stay, staff and environment more than relaxing and friendly, however...Room is coffee and tea free... but clean and well kept...I booked my stay and airport shuttle earlier by an booking agency, where I was told that I would need to speak with a reception the day before the travel to do my shuttle booking.  When it comes to book my shuttle to the airport, first:  I was told by  phone by a receptinist to come down to the reception to have it done... When I come I was told as it is a ""favor"" to do to it, and as it was done by an booking agent not directly by the hotel ""duty manager"" Jao is not happy to do it for me. He was unhappy to help me and he told me to do it by  the ""internet centre and as  it is not so easy as I need to give all my details and numbers ""...I was boilling & appealed. Finally, I did it myself, and it takes less than  2 minutes by an automatic phone info line! Easy peasy dear Jao!OMG! ***** Hotel and this kind of lack of service?To ask a guest to come down to the reception instead to have it done? To judge guest attitude by a ""duty manager"" as a rude, when I kindly  asked just to call and confirm my booking? Lack of skills and unpolite behaviour is  just not fair.It was so unpleasant experience so decide to give * instead *****"
Apr 2016,20,Not 5 star,"Our 2 bedroom apartment was very clean but the beds were so hard.  Add the constant traffic noise day and night, we hardly slept the entire holiday.Bars are very expensive, €3.50 for a can of Pepsi.Restaurant food was good but we had a 45 minute wait just to get into the dining hall one morning.This is not a 5 star hotel, more 3 star. Make sure you check where your room is before you take the key."
Apr 2016,50,Great place  fantastic views.,Would recommend it for s very peaceful and quite location. ... You must come and stay here very large grounds Beautiful beaches. Very nice Lobby just had nape there ... Lol staff very nice and polite also Quite young so they have energy to do things for you.
Apr 2016,40,Great hotel,"Service was five star, location was five star. Rooms needed a little updating as wasn't five star standard. But overall the hotel was immaculate both inside and out. We had a stunning sea view which added to the experience! Buffet breakfast was very good. Ate in the restaurant one night, a little overpriced for what it was!"
Apr 2016,40,Pleasant stay on a Spa break! ,"I visited for the first time as part of a Spa break with my friend. We arrived to be met by our representative & checked in. The hotel receptionists were helpful & said we may have to wait an hour for our room key. Which was fine so we had a coffee in the hotel foyer area. The hotel had an impressive entrance from the main road with a large driveway and apartments either side. The hotel foyer was vast with high ceilings and a mix of contrasting design. A small shop was available on one side of the large staircase that took us down to the dining area or out to the pool area. The spa was under the hotel and consisted of a small gym, treatment rooms, a heated pool of sea water and sauna. To visit the spa it cost €18 so I was glad we got a complementary day pass as I didn't think it was worth the €18. Outside the hotel was a security gate that lead to a lovely cafe over looking the sea. Our room was nice, standard, clean, everything we would expect in the room. Each day it was cleaned and fresh towels were laid out. The restaurant was chaotic and seemed to have no structure for serving a bit of a free for all. The food was average although there was a variety at both breakfast & dinner. A free bus was available daily to take guests to the new town or old town of Albuferia. Overall our stay was really good. The staff were friendly & helpful. We were told off in the spa for filling our water bottles up from the water dispenser which seemed a little overacting but it wasn't a problem. There was wifi which was hit & miss with signal although stronger in the foyer area. (Not that wifi was a major desire which on hols) This hotel was grande in design, grande in entrance but lacked some fine detail of 5star hotels we usually go to.  Attention to detail hit & miss. We also noticed more children at this hotel as it was family orientated with a children's club & area. I didn't care for this on a spa break.  I'm glad we were out of season. The beach was 5mins walked down by the cafe, it was clean & scenic.Thankyou for a nice relaxing week."
Apr 2016,50,Not our first choice .................. but it might be in the future,"A visit to the Grande Real Santa Eulalia was not our initial choice when planning a return trip to the Algarve after 20 years away, but an overbooking at our original hotel turned into a fabulous holiday.  The hotel itself is lovely, and is ideally located above Santa Eulalia beach.  Throughout our stay the staff were helpful and professional and above all, very friendly.  We had a “resort view” room and after our initial “oh, it’s a view of the car park”, we loved sitting on the balcony in the sun, drinking our Sangria watching people coming and going.  Even this car park view has its upside.Santa Eulalia beach can be reached down a small pathway and is lovely and clean, and during our stay (Easter weekend) was never crowded.Breakfast was included in our stay and the morning buffet selection left very little to be desired.  There was a wide variety of food, and the usual beverages ………… and champagne (Ok, a very good sparkling wine, but you get the message).In the evening we ate at 2 of the hotels restaurants:-1.	The hotels own sea food restaurant next to the beach2.	The hotels gourmet burger restaurant,Food at both was excellent and for a 5* hotel very very reasonable (2 course meal for 2 including drinks – 50euros).Location – we initially had concerns as the hotel appeared to be on the outskirts of Albuferia, and we wondered if it would be isolated.  It is located about a 15 minute walk from the new town part of Albuferia and the first lot of bars and supermarket.  Albuferia’s strip is located about 20 minutes away.  We also walked back from Ablufeira old town one day, taking about 35-40 minutes.  If you don’t fancy this, the hotel has its own free shuttle which goes “hotel-new-old” 6 times per day during our stay.  Note, couple of times the popular bus (first in the morning) was soon full.Downside ..... the wifi was a little slow and unreliable (but if that all you can complain about on a relaxing long weekend break, it cant be that bad)"
Apr 2016,40,Celebration of 50th Birthday,"A beautiful and quiet location and that's the reason we chose the Real Hotel & Spa. On morning of 50th we were treated to a luxury Spa (natural sea water). The brunch on the balcony was rather disappointing (served with raw barbecue chicken) which spoilt the rest of the meal. We were charged 65 Euros and although we pointed our dissatisfaction, there was not a single apology from the restaurant Manager. We were supposed to have had an evening meal overlooking the beautiful bay but the reception could not find a booking and out of sheer frustration we decided to eat out. A cake and a bottle of bubbly was waiting for us on our return. We couldn't eat until the following day but was told by reception that a knife and plate to cut and serve the cake would be charged if room service provided same. I tried to get these from the restaurant to be told nothing leaves and it was only through pleading that I managed to get one plate and one knife. Food and drink were generally very expensive in the hotel (22 euros for a vodka tonic and one cocktail). All round it was not a great experience (service & wi-fi quite poor on various occasions) although the surroundings and staff at reception were generally nice."
Apr 2016,40,Nice hotel!,My first impression of the reception area was WOW! It was very clean and nicely decorated. We had a one bed apartment which was clean. We had bed n breakfast. Breakfast was nice but on some days we had to wait half an hour before seated and that's only with the hotel being half full. I hate to see the que in peak.The kids club was very good. My girls enjoyed it very much. However there is no kids entertainment in the evening. The restaurants at the hotel are very expensive. The buffet meal is approx 32 euros per person. For a family of four it would be very expensive. Generally it was a very pleasant stay.
Apr 2016,30,Nice hotel and staff. Stayed September 2015.,The only issue I had was the hotel is out on a limb so to speak.The hotel runs courtesy buses to the old and new town but these can get very busy and if you can't get on the last one (7.30 pm ish) You have to get a taxi.Food very good. Staff very good.If you are not bothered being a little out of the way it's a nice place to stay.
Apr 2016,50,Superb bargain break!,"We secured a great deal for a 7 day break at Grande Real Santa Eulalia via British Airways holidays. When we arrived we were completely taken aback by the size of our one bedroom apartment. The beds were large and comfortable and all the mod cons were present, even a microwave grill. The staff are friendly, welcoming and eager to help. Bar prices are essentially UK prices which is great for a 5 star resort. A special mention goes to Cafe Atlantico. We could quite happily sit with the view over the ocean all day. The food is great and the prices are cheaper than the main hotel. The only confusion for us was why such a great place closes at 6pm!!!"
Apr 2016,50,Would recommend,"The hotel is beautifully decorated, the rooms and public areas are spotless. It is located a little out of the way but after a ten minute walk or less than 5 euros in a taxi you have everything you need. The staff are hardworking and helpful.We had a lovely break in March and would recommend to everyone."
Apr 2016,30,4day spa break,"Although the hotel was lovely , rooms clean and spacious the restaurant staff need lessons in hospitality! Smiling and welcoming your guest would help ! Breakfast staff a lot better then the evening staff , breakfast was fab but evening meals and deserts not to good"
Apr 2016,50,Wonderful hotel. Kind staff. Top class.,"Nothing was too much trouble. Clean rooms, well furnished. Fantastic poolside and beach. They even put a birthday cake and champagne in the room (not requested) for her birthday! The staff are professional, friendly and efficient. Will definitely visit again."
Apr 2016,50,Amazing!,"Well what can we say. From the moment we arrived at this fabulous hotel, we were welcomed with smiling faces. We had been transferred from a sister hotel and we were far from disappointed. The service was amazing from reception to waiting staff. The hotel is immaculate. The choice at breakfast was superb. We never waited for a table even though it was busy at certain times. Staff were more than happy to help. The bar staff were friendly and we had many interesting conversations with the bar manager from football to the best port to take home. Ths outdoor areas were clean and well maintained. The views are beautiful and the beach a couple of minutes away.  We had a wonderful time and are looking forward to returning in the future."
Apr 2016,50,Perfect!,"We had a studio. Heated poolside huge bonus as weather variable. The beach is magnificent and the property looks brand new, it's immaculate. Food disappointing so we        took the free shuttle to town or self-catered."
Apr 2016,50,Honeymoon Luxury,"2nd March 2016 Arrived by private transfer beating the masses for a quick easy and pleasurable check in with Sophia. When we booked online we requested a room with a sea view and a kingsize bed (see title for reasons why). unfortunately the hotel had not been forwarded this request, so our room had two single beds and a not so relaxing view of the north facing car park (no sun on this balcony then). ever so slightly disappointed we returned to the now very busy reception, where we met the fantastic customer experience manager Joao Climaco, who sat us down with a coffee and began to work feverishly in the background. 20 minutes later Joao came to collect us and accompanied us to room 001, with a superking bed and overlooking the sea. The bed was covered with rose petals and looked very romantic indeed, later in the day we had a knock on the door and in came a porter with a complimentary bottle of champagne and petite fois. from day one the the staff in the Grande Real Santa Eulalia where totally fantastic ensuring that everyday just got better and better, starting with a full cooked breakfast from the superbly stocked buffet followed by a glass (or two) of champagne on the veranda whilst being spoiled rotten by Victor who always had a smile on his face and would greet us every morning.The hotel is a wonderful place to stay directly on the beech and only 15 minutes walk to Albufiera or a free shuttle ride away everyday. the staff all carry a continuous smile and will do anything to help at any time of the day.The only negative is nothing to do with the Hotel but with Love Holidays .com, we had booked a private transfer in order to avoid a slow multi stop coach ride and to enable us leave the hotel at 8am and not 5;30am, when we first arrived it took us 35 minutes to find the taxi as we were not greeted at arrivals, we were instructed to call the day before departure to arrange a pick up time, when we called we were told that the taxi would only be able to pick us up at 05:30 as they were fully booked, several expensive phone calls later to love holidays and the transfer company we realized that neither cared at all about our issue with a ""we've had your money now sod off attidude"" so we cancelled the transfer and had to book the hotel cab for a further 40 euros.... needless to say we will never book through love holidays again as there customer service, once they've had your money, is zero.to finish on a high note the whole Grande Real Santa Eulalia experience was fantastic 10/10 to the hotel and 11/10 to the lovely happy friendly staff Thank you :) we shall return for each and every anniversary :)"
Apr 2016,40,"Fab hotel, ideal for relaxing","Arrived home yesterday from a 7 night stay here self catering, we stayed in a studio apartment room 522. Hotel was immaculately clean,studio was spotless and well equipped,we requested a kettle prior to our visit as we're big tea drinkers,which they supplied free of charge. Reception staff we're friendly and welcoming. Hotel location was about 5-10 mom walk into st eulia town where u will find a gd range of bars and restaurants,  we would recommend Nero as it was reasonably priced for very tasty freshly cooked meals. As previous reviews have mentioned the hotel do put on a courtesy bus to the you into albuferia which does get busy. The beach was amazing,for me personally. We didn't use any of the facilities,only 1 pool was heated but we decided to leave it to the kids. Would recommend this hotel from a self catering point of view, suiting people who want to be away from the hustle and hustle but have the choices nearby if required."
Apr 2016,50,A wonderful hotel,"Just returned from a 4 night stay - great value for money - good choice at breakfast - nice rooms very clean lovely staff - the only complaint was 1 pool was heated and was full of children so had to pay 18 euros at the Spa for a swim!!The Spa was great, bit pricy but well worth it overall couldn't fault it."
Apr 2016,40,"Lovely Hotel and facilities, Shame about indoor spa pool extra charges.","2 Bedroom apartment, very spacious. Daily maid service was fantastic and unexpected. The maid did an excellent job cleaning the apartment each day and even any dirty plates that were left out.All the equipment you need for a comfortable stay, TV in every room.No oven though if you were planning to cook evening meals there it might be a little difficult.Pools slightly smaller than you might expect. And as only 1 outdoor pool is heated it was a little over crowded on the sunny days.Staff very friendly and helpful.Reasonable location. If you are not planning to eat in the hotel- which can be a little pricey- the walk to the first lot of restaurants is about 10 minutes away. Plenty to choose from there. It is an up hill walk though so if you struggle walking probably not the best location.Wifi was very fast in room. Had 5 devices connected and no issues with it.Wasn't impressed with having to pay extra if you want to use the indoor spa pool. don't even think children were allowed. It wasn't clear on the website about that- but it didn't spoil as probably would't have used it any way.Also, make sure you check your bill after your stay if you booked independently. I have been charged twice, once on arrival and again on departure. Have to now contact the hotel to ensure I get that back."
Apr 2016,30,"short staffed and inadequate facilities, 45 minute queue for small restraunt area","Move over Jorge [--], Basil and Manuel are on their way from FawltyTowers to take over your job.ople who stayed at this hotel . Staff are very professional and courteo Don't bother with the generic apologetic reply.  You obviously didn't listen to the dozens of other observations made by peus, pity you don't employ enough if them. The waiting staff are run off their feet. Seriously, get more waiting staff instead of forcing them to work harder A five star hotel should not have a 45 minute queuing time to get into the woefully undersized restraunt. The jacuzzi bath in the room did not work .  The beach has hazardous cliffs that look ready to collapse. There is a constant irritating drone of boat engines on the beach during the day. Sea comes right up the beach at high tide leaving no room to do much. Aside from that it should be a four star hotel until these little problems get fixed."
Apr 2016,40,Strange All Inclusive rules,"A few days before 3 friends and I travelled we were told our hotel had been changed from a 4* All Inclusive to this 5* hotel (for operational reasons).  On arrival we thought it looked very nice and in fact the hotel and amenities were very good with lovely views over the sea and a beach which you could access from the hotel.  We arrived late, around 11pm and our rooms were not ready, as booked (doubles instead of twins) but this was rectified with no problem, fairly quickly.  Whilst this was being organised we went to the bar and ordered some drinks but were told we couldn't have them as it was after 11pm.  We stated that we had just arrived and our rooms weren't ready, but on further questioning it was said that they weren't allowed on All inclusive basis after 11pm. So we ordered and paid for them instead.  The next morning we had breakfast which was very good and went to explore our surroundings.  Later in the morning we came across the next `ruling'.  One of our party went to order some tea & coffees and we were told we couldn't have waiter service but when she asked for a tray to carry various cups, saucers, sugar etc out to the terrace where we were sitting was told she couldn't have a tray!  Later in the day we were told there were certain drinks we couldn't have and so we asked to see the manager to clarify what was what.  He eventually came and told us that we were being offered the same basis as we would have had at our previously booked hotel.  That was why there was no waiter service, no liquors, only cocktail of the day allowed etc.  We mentioned the tray business but didn't get a satisfactory explanation to this ruling.It seemed that the staff had been issued with information about what we could and what we couldn't have, but we were not issued with this information ourselves.  We just found out when we were told we couldn't have it.  It was extremely embarrassing for us as we began to feel like 2nd class guests and some of the staff were also not happy about it too.  The best staff were at the pool bar and in the restaurant and the rudest staff were in the main bar.As we said to the manager, ""we didn't ask to go to that hotel, we were just put there"".  I feel that we should have been given the ground rules at reception when we arrived and so we would have known to what we were entitled.  There was no apology from the Manager and he just would not accept our comments including the one about the trays, giving no explanation of that at all. We were never allowed to use a tray to take our drinks to the table, even when we said we would bring it straight back.  It was a great shame that a holiday in such a lovely resort was marred by petty rules, some rude staff and being made to feel that we weren't wanted there.There was supposed to be free Wifi in the bedrooms, but I could never get it.  It was OK in the reception area though.  There was one heated pool which was full of children (fair enough) but if the weather had been better we probably couldn't have found space for swimming.  The indoor pool was in the spa and you could use it at cost of E18.  All spa treatments were expensive and consequently very few people used them.  Why don't hotels reduce the prices as they would get more customers using the facilities? What a pity that a lovely hotel like this has sullied it's reputation by strange rules not explained to the guests and some very rude staff."
Apr 2016,50,"Warm, welcoming, professional, what a great holiday they made for us!","I'm reluctant to give this review but only because this hotel is so good that really I just want to keep it to myself and not share it with anybody else. From the moment of making the booking to the moment of leaving the hotel we were made to feel special.  Nothing was too much trouble and every request was met with a smile and a ""no problem"" attitude.  We stayed in one of the 1 bed apartments in the grounds of the hotel because we wanted to have our own kitchen & I have to say that this was a great choice for us because I like to prepare a simple breakfast & snacks etc. but if you prefer to eat out for every meal the hotel rooms were stunningly beautiful and I know because we asked to see one and the view from the room was amazing but we had to give up the Sea view in favour of having the apartment as unfortunately only the hotel rooms have the Sea view.  They do have suites with a sea view but we were told that these didn't have kitchens either.The hotel is very large and has great facilities with 4 restaurants (all of which we tried and loved) a thalassotherapy pool, steamroom, sauna, gym and some great free classes that are run throughout the week such as Pilates and aquacise which takes place in the thalassotherapy pool. We did the free half hour aquacise class and had a great, fun workout - the trainer was very good, professional and made sure we were all doing it correctly and safely.  The staff at the Spa were great and very helpful.  You receive complimentary towels, disposable slippers and robes in which to walk about in the spa.   The only thing we had to pay for was 3 EU for a skull cap so that for those of us with long hair (hubby didn't need to worry about this one!) didn't shed lots of hairs into the ultra clean pool - it was all lovely and very hygienic.  You could tell that the staff took a great pride in their surroundings.Because we had read some negative reviews about the food in the buffet restaurant we had decided against the food package but this was a mistake on our part as we tried the food at the buffet restaurant for a couple of nights and it was beautiful and plentiful with a vast array of choices for every course.  There was always a fish dish, a meat dish and a vegetarian dish for the main and the puddings were delicious!   There were also lovely ice creams on offer and lots of choices of various breads, olives etc. etc.We ate at the fish restaurant for 3 nights which is down a few steps towards the beach and the food was lovely and tasty and with a very knowledgeable Maitre d'.   You could choose your own fish from the fresh selection on offer in the chiller cabinet and they would weigh your choice and give you a price before cooking it to perfection!We had lunch in the daytime restaurant next door to the fish restaurant and can highly recommend the tuna salad!   The only thing I didn't like was that as with everywhere we ate at in Portugal the only chips on offer were pre-packaged frozen ""fries"" - it would be great if we could have got proper chips made from potatoes but that's just my personal preference and not a reflection of the hotel.We don't usually eat burgers but decided to try the dedicated ""Burger Restaurant"" at least once during our stay - well it was so good we ended up going twice!   These were some classy burgers - I had the Turkey burger which was beautifully spiced and along with the accompaniments made for a delicious meal!  Hubby had the beef and enjoyed it as much as I did mine.  The lady Maitre D' here was very welcoming and spoke excellent English so we were able to have a bit of light banter with her.  A very nice atmosphere all round.The hotel itself was run like clockwork and we never had to ask twice for anything as everything was efficiently presented and always with a smile. Also they had a great little golf buggy to run our suitcases to the room on the first day which was a nice touch.The cleaners who looked after our room did an amazing job and I don't know if it was just our cleaner or whether it's hotel policy but she even cleaned up our dishes in the kitchen!   My husband was very grateful for this as it's my job to prepare food/snacks and his to clean the kitchen so he really enjoyed his holiday away from doing this chore!  We've never experienced this at any other hotel we've stayed in so they really do go the extra mile to look after you here!All in all it's the best hotel we've ever stayed in and we will definitely be going back soon!  The only downside to me doing this review is that we probably won't be able to get in because it will be so fully booked after people read this!!!"
Apr 2016,50,Relaxing mini break in March,"Stayed for 3 nights in March 2016, friendly staff, beautiful location,Spa not included and  quite pricey but still treated ourselves to a couple of treatments. No indoor pool, pool in spa is a treatment only. Outdoor pool is warm and pool area clean. No pool bars open but we were very early in season. Bar and lounge area was relaxing, evening entertainment was really good with a different act every night and some talented singers, bar very pricey though!  Rooms were clean and spacious only downside was no tea making facilities which is really disappointing for a 5 star hotel. Free shuttle service to town was useful but cab fare was 7 euros so really cheap. Beach is lovely and fish restaurant was great, good quality food but not cheap! Would definitely go back next year! Perfect for a min break to escape the English weather!"
Apr 2016,50,"Nice location and spacious, well equipped apartments","We stayed here for a week in a 2 bed apartment. The apartment was clean & spacious and well equipped. The private beach was nice. We needed a tin opener and the reception staff gave us one within a couple of minutes. The staff were friendly and helpful. The free shuttle bus to the old town was great, however queue earlier as places are limited. Out of the hotel gates, turn left and about 15 mins walk there is a great Chinese restaurant. Further on the right is the Intermarche supermarket which is great too."
Apr 2016,50,Wonderful,"We stayed here for 5 nights and I cannot say enough good things about it.  The hotel is wonderful and the staff are so friendly and helpful.  We had a sea view room and what a view. Great nights sleep in a very comfortable bed.  Breakfast is great with lots of choice.  There can be a queue to get in around 9;30am  but is moves along fairly quickly.  We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and were given complimentary champagne and small treats.  Great gesture.  Access to the private beach was great.  Downside,as such, is that it is about a 10-15min walk to the nearest shops but that was acceptable to us.  Free shuttle bus to Old Town every couple of hours from the hotel.  We were not leaving until 6pm but we were advised that we could use the shower facilities in the Real Spa, which was a nice touch. Also there was free wifi in all areas of the hotel and music most nights. We looked for an iron but you have to pay €5.00 for 24 hours use.  All in all we had a great & very relaxing break."
Apr 2016,50,Happy couple,"Me and my partner really enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel. The private beach was a really nice touch. I must say that when travelling outside of the hotel grounds it became clear that we were staying in probably the best hotel. The staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. Credit to all the staff for a fantastic job, from the chamber maids to the waiters and reception staff. Very affordable and relaxing place to destress for your time away. Although we don't have children the hotel was perfect for families."
Apr 2016,50,What a fantastic hotel,"6 day break over Easter, and I was very impressed with the hotel.Booked through Booking.com and given the price for a 6 night stay in a family appartment on a B&B basis, I have to say I wasnt expecting much.  I thought it would be a five star on its way down trying to win some business, I paid £450 for the 6 nights.  Well how wrong can you be, the hotel is close to immaculate, the service and staff are outstanding.  Food was good, the lunchtime BBQ if a tad expensive at €30 per head, the meats on offer are great and all the food is very well prepared.Apartments are spacious, clean and well maintained.  Breakfast is a little busy if you get down about 9ish as we did, but they turn the tables around quickly.The beach is just stunning, sea was still a tad cold but the kids still got amongst it.Its a gorgeous setting, close enough to both Albufeira and Villamora, about a tenner to Albufeira and 20 to Villamora, bith well worth a visit.On the whole very impressed, we took the In Laws with us, and the apartments are a short hop to the hotel which for my disabled mother in law was too much, but call reception and they send the buggy across, never waited more than five minutes for a ride.On the whole a fabulous break, bargain price paid and thoroughly enjoyable time had by all.Would definitely go back and would like to stay for longer."
Apr 2016,40,Lovely hotel and staff,What a very charming hotel. Can't praise it enough. Staff were lovely and the bar staff were amazing. Only problem was I thought the heated pool was outside but that was the travel agents fault tbf. The strip was 10 mins walk but only done it once as it was rotten. Found a wee Portuguese bar up the road where you got a coffee and a beer for 2euro. The old town is a taxi ride away but it's pretty cheap at bat 6 euros for 4 people. The room we had in the hotel was also very nice. Overall I would definitely stay here again
Apr 2016,40,Lovely hotel ,"We got a good deal on this hotel with the plane, so was highly delighted to get a 5* hotel.  However, I am glad we didn't pay a lot of money for this hotel, as I would expect more from a 5* hotel personally. The apartment was very clean and very nice.  We had a bottle of water and a bottle of milk left for us, which was nice. The rooms were cleaned everyday and the cleaners was very nice and polite. The receptionists were helpful and polite.There are three main pools, one appeared warmer then the rest so we presumed that it was heated in the morning. There was also a large pool by our apartment which was freezing cold and a small pool that was tapped off, so couldn't be used.There is a nice selection of food for breakfast, pastries, meats, cheeses, fruit and hot food. The food for lunch and dinner is expensive and doesn't look worth the prices. There is a restaurant by the beach which is owned by the hotel for lunch and another that opens for dinner. The beach is clean and very accessible, there is a play area on the way down with table tennis, which we used a lot and was quite quiet. The spa is not available for under 13's, which is a shame as we have a 5yr old. The indoor pool costs 18euros for an hour.There is a kids club, which is very popular and appeared good.There is a bus that takes you into new town and old town and back again, which is free.The only criticism that we have, is that we feel it would have been better to have some water exercise either in or out of the pools for an hour every morning for the kids, but the adults could join in if they so wished...."
Apr 2016,40,"Excellent hotel, little bit out the way. ","This was a lovely hotel and deserves its 5 stars. We travelled with 2 children aged 5months and 4 years, the hotel catered very well for having a young family! The kids club seemed very good we only used it one day for a activity day though, but there was plenty going on all the time. The heated swimming pool was much needed as all the others was freezing. The hotel is sited a little way out but does offer the shuttle bus, but that was always full. A taxi to the old town which is well worth a visit is around 7 euros. Drinks in the hotel are a little bit steep in my opinion. There is a supermarket just a 5 minute walk away which has everything you need. Great views of the beach."
Mar 2016,30,Nice hotel let down by some poor service,"Having stayed at this hotel a few year ago, we were excited to return for our second visit last week. It was apparent that the hotel is now in need of some TLC and some areas are quite tired although initial thought were that this was due to being out of season? The facilities are not ideal for families, with a very small play area and no entertainment suitable for our 2 and 8 year olds. It's only a 20 minute walk to the nearest town but I do have to warn you there are some hills and we noticed some older walkers turn back. We opted for the evening buffet in the restaurant one night and to say it was awful would be an understatement and most definite not child friendly as our children and ourselves left hungry and it cost was over 100 euros. Also, children under 16 are not permitted in the indoor pool if the weather is poor. Our worst memories are of the restaurant overlooking the beach where the staff were extremely rude on both occasions we tried to eat there ( I say tried as on the second attempt we were dismissed embarrassingly as we had ""sat on  the wrong seat"" and we left). On the upside, the staff on reception are fantastic and can't do enough to help. This area of Portugal is great, with a 10 minute cab ride to the old town (less of a stag and hen do area than the new town) it's a good area but I would not stay at this hotel again. Would also agree not 5*"
Mar 2016,50,Fabulous Short Stay,"Just returned from a 5 day stay at this hotel and I'm truly impressed. Everything was either perfect or very good. The location, contrary to what others have said, is actually very nice. There are big supermarkets and tons of restaurants only 10 minutes away on foot. The shuttle bus is quite handy and takes you to both new town and old town although taxi would only be less than 10 euro. The hotel grounds were immaculate; clean, beautiful, excellent views, well laid out. The food at breakfast and dinner was fabulous with great choice and quality. The Atlantico restaurant is great and extremely well priced for lunchtime. We stayed in an apartment which was well equipped and clean and only a 4 minute walk to the main building. The staff in the restaurants and reception were always helpful and friendly. The pool deck was nice and the beach was even better. I would recommend people to visit in March/April as there was less of a crowd, prices were good and the weather was bright and sunny everyday, not too hot and not too cold. My only faults/ recommendations about this hotel:- The indoor pool was quite a disappointment. On the day we arrived it was slightly cloudy and a bit too cold for the outdoor pool so we went to the indoor one. Turns out it's a special '30 degree seawater pool only for 16 years and over' and costs 20 euro per person... quite a rip off in my opinion. They should get rid of this completely and make an indoor pool for all, it would be much more successful as this pool was always empty when I visited - If you did not get a food offer then food and drink would be quite expensive. For example, one pepsi cost us 6 euro at dinner and a bottle of water was 4 euro. - There was one pool deck at the main hotel which was always quite busy during the peak hours but I guess the beach makes up for this. However, in the whole hotel there is only one heated outdoor pool. The rest are all cold and seawater. They should do something about this. - The staff at the kids club/ activities area were a bit clueless. We wanted to play basketball in the courts as a group with the teenagers but they could not organise this and didn't really know how to go about it. Maybe because it wasn't peak holiday season but there were plenty of kids around.- Wifi was very slow in the actual hotel but was great in the apartment. Overall, it is really hard to fault this amazing hotel. I had a wonderful time here and would recommend it to all."
Mar 2016,40,"Nice property, beautiful location, great value","We stayed for 2 nights in a one bedroom apartment.  Value at this time of year at least was unbeatable for the room we got.  I think I read in some other reviews that the kitchenette was lacking in pots and pans; we found a full set of pots and pans in the cabinet underneath the TV - plenty of supplies to make a reasonable dinner.  Only minor gripes about the kitchenette is that there was no dish soap or in room coffee/tea provided.  We ended up having to buy full supplies of both which felt like a waste seeing as we were only staying two nights.  I am not sure if this is the norm in Europe as we generally stay in apartments and not hotels or resorts.  Anyway, not a big concern as there are supermarkets within an easy walk of the property.  There are also a number of good restaurants within a 10-15 minute walk.  The apartments are nicely situated with south facing patios to soak up the warm rays, even at this time of year with temperatures hovering below 20 degrees it was very pleasant to sit on the patio in shorts.  Being off season we did not get to use many of the available amenities but we did make a quick stop in the kids club and our infant daughter really enjoyed it! Very friendly staff in there!"
Mar 2016,40,"5* hotel, 4* service ","We have just returned from a one week stay at this hotel. Overall we were fairly happy with our stay however we do not believe it reflected a 5* resort. The check in was smooth, we were generally happy with our room however there was damp stains on the carpet which we felt should have been rectified. The room was kept really clean and the bedding/towels were changed regularly. The bathroom was clean and the maids did a really thorough good job. Breakfast had a good variety - there was always something - however it wasn't very warm. Though as mentioned in previous reviews the staff were working really hard and were attentive. The breakfast staff deserve a pat on the back because they were the friendliest staff in the hotel. The private beach was a lovely addition and was very clean with plenty of space for all the hotel guests. The pool space was also clean however the pools are not big enough and we felt this really let the hotel down. We asked whether the hotel had an indoor pool however we were told it would cost us $20 to use each for 1 hour which we were disappointed by as we had paid a lot to stay at the hotel. The bar and food is very expensive! We spent most of our time in the town for food and drinks as it was a lot cheaper. We didn't eat in the evenings at all in the restaurants because we felt it was overpriced.  We recommend the Fuji Japanese in town - it was very good. The hotel snack bar by the beach was reasonable when we tried it one lunchtime. The evening bar had good entertainment (live singers) though as mentioned the drinks were too expensive for what you got and the service was relatively poor - drink orders took a while and on our first night we stood at the bar for 10 minutes whilst the bar staff had a chat. The hotel seems to charge for everything. We had to pay for an iron at a cost of $5 a day which we were disappointed by as these are given free in even a Travelodge in the UK! We played tennis once which was good however we were told we had an hour and a member of staff after 45 minutes told us that we needed to come off the court and let someone on who had been waiting. We were a bit disappointed by this. Overall we would not stay here again. The location was great but the service really wasn't up to scratch for a 5* resort."
Mar 2016,40,Beautiful hotel,"Just returned from this hotel after a break away with my boyfriend. This hotel is stunning and staff are fantastic here. We had breakfast included each morning and it was delicious! However the seats are so close together, but that's no big deal. The hotel has everything you would want for a nice chilled out break. The only thing I would change is that the shuttle bus that runs into town was more frequent and that the wifi was better. We found it quite poor, however these are only small things ! Loved our stay here."
Mar 2016,50,Most beautiful hotel we have ever visited!,"Just wow. This hotel is absolutely stunning. We were blown away at the beauty of this place. The views are to die for and the rooms are incredible!The staff were generally amazing, especially Stephen and the younger girls. One older lady on reception was quite rude though!There were a couple of small things we thought could be improved:- The food range and quality in the main restaurant. This was majorly overpriced and generally quite poor. The beach snack bar was our savour! - The pools were a little small - The spa should be free or at least a lot cheaper! Again this was overpriced Overall, the place was amazing!!!!!!"
Mar 2016,40,Fantastic time at a beautiful hotel ,"Just got home from a 5 night break with my girlfriend,  arrived at the hotel and was greeted by a very friendly guy who guided us to reception and booked in without any issues,  although we arrived on an early flight in and arrived at the hotel at 09:30 our room wouldn't be available until 15:00 but the manager said he would get us in ASAP, it was a beautiful day so didn't mind and gave us an opportunity to see the pool area and beach.  Walking through the lobby which was awesome through the glass doors on the patio area and swimming pools (only thing wrong was pools were tiny) within the hour we were approached by a member of staff to inform us our room was ready and could be taken straight up.  We were taken up into a very spacious room with the biggest bed in the world, TV and fridge over looking the beach.  Breakfast was wonderful and had lots to choose from and tried everything within the six days.  I couldnt recommended this hotel enough, it was fantastic and will definitely be booking again next year.  Tim and olga,  UK"
Mar 2016,50,A short break in albeuferia in march we went half board,My wife and I went there for a short break as it was her birthday the hotel was really great over looking the ocean although  we had a room to the front of the hotel it the back that is towards the ocean that was the only blip.The only drawback for us was it was to far from the town and even though there was a free bus to the town it was not possible to get on as there were a lot of guests trying to get the bus we got a taxi a few times it was only about 5euro it was handier than queuing all in all we were pleased with the hotel and the holiday weather sunny all day but a cold wind in the evenings but it was march and we did not go for a sun holiday
Mar 2016,50,"Lovely, friendly hotel ","We stayed here for a long weekend for my birthday. When we arrived we were upgraded to a sea view with a jacuzzi.  The views from the hotel are amazing. The room was large and very clean, in fact the hotel on a whole was spotless.  There are many restaurants and bars.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  On the evening of my birthday a trolley with a cake and champagne was placed on our room.  This hotel is stunning and definitely worth the money. 😄😄"
Mar 2016,40,Close to Beach and substantial buffets,Located right on the seafront and has an outdoor heated swimming pool.(the heating was needed in March)At low tide you can walk easily into Albufeira old town (a bit of a scramble over the cliff path at high tide) in about an hour.Had a half board package which was substantial buffets at breakfast and dinner.  Several choices of dinner so something always to our liking.Room was comfortable and quiet.Only downside is there is not much to visit in the evenings as the hotel is out of town.Although new Albufeira strip is about a 20 minute walk uphill.Recommended !
Mar 2016,40,"lovely stay, pity about the food","Great location, beautiful room with superb see view. Super friendly staff everywhere in the resort. Unfortunately for a 5 star hotel, the buffet food was very disappointing. A la Carte not too bad. Also the spa pool: we got 10% discount on € 20, but found that all the statiobs were not working, or not working properly. What a shame. It could be a nice facility"
Mar 2016,50,Another great stay,"This was another return visit. The hotel for us is ideally situated. It is far enough away from the hustle and bustle of main town Albufeira, but close enough to either stroll in or catch the hotel free shuttle if you want a bit more 'action'.We had a suite on this occasion and it was absolutely and definitely worth what we paid. We had two bathrooms, two balconies, a lounge and dining area as well as a separate bedroom. It really was very good. There was only the two of us so we had a great time spreading out in comfort.The staff were very efficient, polite, friendly and couldn't be faulted.Everywhere was kept very clean and tidy. We really did have a very good weeks break in the sun.If I was to find any fault at all, it would be that the breakfast buffet was not as good as on previous visits. It was okay, but could have been hotter and fresher in the cooked sections. However the cooks were working extremely hard and some of the problems encountered during our visit could have been in our opinion down to management not putting on additional staff to cope with the volumes of guests generated on corporate functions.Overall a lovely visit and we would return."
Mar 2016,50,Cannot fault one bit!,"Just got back from this hotel and already want to go back! The staff are amazing, a real credit to the hotel. It seems like nothing is too much for them. It was my boyfriends birthday during our stay and we got a cake and champagne delivered to the room.  Such a surprise.The buffet restaurant is superb and great value for money. Breakfast and dinner must have caused me to put on at least a stone or two! Great for local cuisine and a bit of English too. Didn't go to the spa or the pool so can't really comment on those. The free shuttle into the old and new town was and life-saver and always on time and very efficient. Would definitely recommend getting a sea view as the scenery is really something else. I will be back!!"
Mar 2016,40,Good food but difficult for those with mobility problems. ,"I have just returned from a 4 day break with friends. which was generally very good, food, comfortable room etc. But....I had informed the hotel in advance that I had broken my foot and had some mobility problems. On arrival, I was given a room at the very end of a long corridor. It could not have been more inconvenient. The hotel was full, due to a conference. Because of the layout of the hotel, anytime I wanted to go to the restaurant or pool, I had to go up in one lift, across the large lobby, down in another lift, and across another lobby, which took forever. Another minor gripe - to order a drink while sitting by the pool, you have to go inside and find someone. They do not regularly come round and check. This might be because it was low season, but again, awkward for the less mobile. So, lovely hotel, but be careful if you have any special needs and clarify that you need to be on the correct side of the hotel (and avoid room 008)!"
Mar 2016,50,Short break in the sunshine!,"Arrived on the 8th March until the 11th on a Groupon deal. Check in so quick and reception staff are a credit to your hotel, so friendly and helpful. Had an apartment perfectly situated for everything and spotlessly clean. beach beautiful and pools are too. Bit too chilly to swim but we had amazing temps and i came back with a tan! Bar staff great, as indeed were all staff. I am so glad i booked this trip we had so much fun. Will return soon!"
Mar 2016,50,"Noleen, Northern Ireland","Excellent hotel, really relaxing time with very friendly and helpful staff.  Our transfer to and from hotel went very smoothly.  Free shuttle bus into town very good and always on time.  Entertainment at night very good."
Mar 2016,50,Wedding abroad!,"We stayed here for a week in October for a family wedding! We stayed in one of the apartments, we were all located next door to each other which was great! Everything you need from a self catering kitchen to a spacious living area. We visited towards the end of October so it was pretty quiet so we had the pool outside more or less to ourselves. The hotel itself was really clean and modern. Easy to get a taxi to the old or new town, usually cost about €10 to the old town. I had never been to Portugal before but would most definitely go back and stay here."
Mar 2016,40,Nice hotel but a bit out of the way.,"This is a really nice hotel in Santa Eulalia, but it's a bit out of the way of the main resort of Alberfuria. However there is a free bus test runs quite regular into the Strip and the Old a Town. The bus only holds 27 passengers so at busy times you need to queue early.The staff in this hotel are really freindly and very helpful, I must give Sophia on reception a specail mention she was so pleasant and helpful with all our enquiries, nothing seemed to be any trouble for her always had a big smile on her face.The room we got was overlooking the main entrance but was well maintained with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was nice with a very big bath which I could lie down in and a nice hot powerful shower.the room was maintained on a daily basis by lovely house keepers plenty of toiletries replenished daily.Due to visiting out of season there was only the main Restuarant open but it was really nice. Again the restaurant staff where so pleasant freindly and helpful. The choice of food is not to bad although there was a limited menu there was always something you could eat. Food is regularly replenished and always hot to eat, loved the bread which is so fresh it could have come straight from the bakery. Breakfasts very nice and you could order your eggs to be cooked fresh and in anyway.Lovely heated swimming pool and plenty is sun beds available, even though it was very quiet. Nice views across the beach and a little cafeteria near the beach.If you want and nice relaxing lazy time with a lovely atmosphere and staff that cannot do enough to make your stay as enjoyable as possible this is the place to go."
Mar 2016,50,A Real Caribbean Vibe!,"I had a lovely 5 night stay in the Grand Real Santa Eulalia from 28feb..hoping for some sunshine and blue skies the weather couldn't have been better,which made it possible to make the most of the lovely outside spaces at the hotel..The hotel has a real ""away from it all""feel and the very spacious lobby opens out onto a pool and seating area with great views of the ocean..A short walk down by the atlantico restaurant which has amazing views also,is a very well maintained beach which was ideal for early morning walks with nothing but the sound of the sea,it was very peaceful as the season had not yet started.The breakfast had an extensive choice,and had a wonderful array of fresh fruit,croissants and some mornings, the best mini portuguese tarts!.My room 322 was excellent very spacious, with a balcony with table and chairs which got the early morning sun and looked out on a nice landscaped area, the soundproofing was very good.The room was cleaned and everything replenished  each day.One evening it was nice to return to find a tray with a choice of teas and homemade cookies waiting for me.The trip to eastern algarve booked with the ticket office in olhos de agua was a great day out for 20e,and the lunch stop was excellent in villa real san antonio, which is very pretty and has great shopping!.The location of the hotel is excellent for visiting many places in the area, Albufeira centre is a short journey in the bus and the local eva bus stop is at the entrance to the hotel. While the hotel was not too busy there were many people there from all over europe and america which made a nice atmosphere.The main restuarant has great sea views.I booked shuttle direct/green bus from faro to the hotel 20e return and it was very reliable. I was very happy with the value/price I paid on booking.com and am even more amazed at the value offered for 2 or more people sharing for such a luxury hotel in a superb location almost on the beach! The hotel hosts weddings so it would probably have a much busier feel if it was at full capacity..hoping this helps fellow travellers."
Mar 2016,50,Month last night stay,"We arrived back mid Feb to spend a month at this beautiful property after having spent a month here in one bedroom apartment in Feb/March 2015.We love everything about this place... But the biggest asset of the hotel is its staff. Reception staff are professional, friendly and helpful. The housekeeping staff are wonderful. All restaurant and bar staff have been great. Our apartment is lovely ,clean and well equipped.staff respond immediately to any concern. This year the manager delivered a fabulous bottle of wine and fruit tray to welcome us back. We have enjoyed the pool, beach, spa, and really enjoy the live entertainment offered in lobby a few times weekly. We have stayed in many places in Algarve and nothing comes close to this. We rate it superb!"
Mar 2016,30,Short break,"Booked through low cost holidays, all separate jet2 flight no complains 2.5 hrs. Transfers with resort hoppa £30 return half hr drive from airport brill service. The hotel lovely entrance 5star, check in quick & lovely staff taken to our room on the buggy & the porter explained everything we needed to know. Evening meal I was a little disappointed for a 5star, was expecting at least steak or chicken on offer, yes I know it's Portugal & fish is a local dish but I've been to other places 4stars with a lot better quality & choice of food, but the cheese board was excellent. The 1st night had to complain about the room upstairs (the noise) ring reception & got sorted right away. Breakfast is very nice the lady chef would make fresh omelettes, & plenty of other choices. The hotel has its own beach & surrounding area which is beautiful. The free shuttle bus is handy. The nearest pubs for us ( watching footy) was bout 15 mins walk up a hill . It was my birthday while a way & got a lovely cake, wine, champagne & fruit a very nice touch & apologies for the noise other night ."
Mar 2016,50,Stunning!,"Stayed here during the February half term with two teenage boys and my husband in a two bedroom apartment. Stunning place, loved it. Apartments best I have ever stayed in, clean, spacious, very well equipped. The grounds,beach and  hotel all gorgeous. Free bus from the hotel to the strip and the old town was great. All the staff were lovely and friendly and happy to help. We didn't use the spa but it looked really nice just a bit disappointed that you had to pay extra to use it. We would love to return later in the year if we can."
Feb 2016,50,Stunning location,"We have just returned from a week at this great hotel situated in beautiful gardens overlooking the stunning beach of Santa Eulalia.  We stayed in the main building where the rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean and well equipped with free safe and wi-fi and great sound-proofing.  The bathrooms have a bath with overhead shower, quality toiletries, big fluffy towels and bathrobes provided.  The hotel reeks of old-world charm but with very modern facilities.  We stayed on HB basis;  breakfast choices were excellent with many healthy choices;  dinner choices were more limited but with something to suit everyone, (An a la carte menu is also available)  The outside terraces are extensive and on different levels and there is an ample supply of loungers, tables etc. The restaurant/bar by the beach is highly recommended. We had no children in our group but the children's facilities looked excellent, Last, but by no means least, the staff - service is first class, efficient but friendly.  I would very much like to visit this hotel again. If you go, book a sea-view room - it is worth the extra money!"
Feb 2016,50,Beautiful spot,"We really enjoyed our stay at The Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort. The kids absolutely loved the children's staff and the activities in the kids club, which meant we had a couple of hours to relax in the afternoons. The bar/restaurant overlooking the beautiful sheltered beach is fabulous. It's a quiet hotel and will suit people looking for a relaxed break. We stayed in a Sea View Suite, it was huge and worth the upgrade cost. We ate in the hotel each night on the half board option and everyone, kids included, loved the food from the buffet. The house red was very good and reasonable at 14 euros. Throughout the resort, the staff were very professional and lovely to deal with. We used the spa and it was very relaxing, as we pre booked it was 10 euro each on the 2 occasions we went, which was ok but would be better if it was included in stay. I'm glad we experienced it but there were a few things out of order which would have made the experience even better. The suites in the main building are expensive and hard to get in high season so we had a look at the apartments before we left, the decor unfortunately wasn't as nice as the suites which is a real pity, I think the colour scheme (orange and green) lets them down as they are very spacious and well equipped. No apartments seemed to have sea views either, another pity. Overall I'd give this hotel 4.5 out of 5 because of the few things letting it down mentioned above, but it's very good value for money considering the standard, so giving our recent stay in the Seaview Suite a five star review. We will definitely return."
Feb 2016,50,Beautiful hotel,We really enjoyed our holiday at Santa Eulalia! The hotel is beautiful and private beach is a huge plus. We stayed at the apartments which are well equipped and spacious. The hotel was quiet and very relaxing at this time of year.
Feb 2016,50,A few days away,"I booked this hotel via trip adviser/ bookings.com. It was a bit of a bargain and I wasn't expecting anything too flashy. I was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel and grounds are lovely and I was told by a portugese chap in the town that it was one of the best hotels in the area and I can agree. We stayed on a b&b basis and as it is obviously out of season the hotel was super quiet but that suited us. The rooms are lovely and spacious, ask for one with a sea view when you book, the breakfast was excellent and the heated outdoor pool made my few days away. The weather was pretty good (18 degrees) and sunny which also helps. We didn't use the gym, indoor pool or the spa as the weather was so favourable but from what I saw of them they also looked very nice. I can highly recommend this hotel, it is a little gem and the staff were also really lovely and helpful."
Feb 2016,50,Paradise,Had a wonderful stay. Nothing to much for the staff. Excellent breakfast. Lovely location. All in all excellent experience. We upgraded to sea view highly recommend. Great bus service to town. Fantastic!
Feb 2016,50,Exceeded my expectations!,"My stay at the Grande Santa Eulalia Resort has been full of wonderful surprises. First of all, I have to say that the Hotel's photos don't come close to illustrate the essence of the hotel. It has elegant, yet rustic, ample spaces, with tasteful (leather/wood) decor, which creates a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. I stayed in one of the sea view rooms on the third floor, which has an incomparable view towards luscious trees, rocky cliffs, and the Atlantic ocean. Nothing better than to open the sliding windows of your private balcony, and listen to the sound of the ocean; morning breeze included! Bliss. My room was spotlessly cleaned every day and chocolates were left for a good night treat. Once, after a long and rather chilly day, I came to my room to find a tray with a hot teapot, milk jar and biscuits! I don't know why it was left there; the tray had a note that said... ""Everything that arrives, arrives always for some reason."" The power of small details -and Grande Santa Eulalia is full of them-. Breakfast was included on my rate, and I have to say that I was able to eat something different each day; freshly squeezed juice (not artificial) from the region's famous oranges was available; large selection of fruits, pastries, cheeses and cereals. All fresh and delicious. ...and the coffee...strong and full of flavour! After a nice breakfast, you can just walk towards the beach, for an uplifting and energizing stroll.I saved the best for last. The people. Always welcoming, informative, knowledgeable and very kind; a tough mix to find. Thank you for those daily smiles! Overall, it's easy to fall in love with Portugal, if at the end of the day you can always come back to a homely place. I will definitely plan a second visit to Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and Hotel Spa."
Feb 2016,20,No Swiming pool unless you pay 20 euros,Ok so we are here out of season but no excuses for not providing a useable swimming pool. There are many pools around the resort and each one is provided with a water quality information board. However the temperature stated on each of these boards in no way reflects the actual temperature of th water for example one pool says 23.5 degrees Celsius and I can't even put a foot in it. The actual temperature is about 5 degrees celcius  so they have obviously turned the pool heating off. So this now leaves one option and that is the indoor pool  but not for anyone under 16 and you have to pay 20 euros each to use it because it's part of the thalassotherapy spa. So don't think you are getting anything spa included in your booking because you aren't.The hotel decided to host a commercial team building event for a whole day where the entire grounds were overrun by ignorant annoying loud groups all searching for hidden clues. We couldn't get peace anywhere and everywhere we went they were in our face physically climbing above dinner tables to reach envelopes hidden on the pergola at the beach bar. Again I'm aware it was out of season but everything that wasn't essential to keep the hotel open was Closed.On the plus side it was a clean comfortable room and staff are very pleasant but when booking I had no inclination that our apartment was away from the main hotel in a separate block. But good WiFi.
Feb 2016,50,Absolutely fabulous,"Amazing hotel with the best customer service I have seen. They sent my mother champagne and a delicious birthday cake on her birthday. Such a lovely surprise. I never told them it was her birthday. The hotel is situated just outside the main town.great location with a lovely beach. The shops are within walking distance. There is a free hotel courtesy bus to the old town and new town every day. The hotel staff are so friendly, efficient and helpful. The hotel grounds are immaculate, there are cold swimming pools and heated swimming pools. We stayed in the self catering villas, cheerfully decorated with everything you need, they are serviced every day. I would love to come back sometime. I totally recommend this hotel."
Feb 2016,50,Holiday stay,We are currently at the hotel my wife and I for our anniversary the hotel have been amazing in the way they have made our visit very special we cannot express our thanks to the staff we cannot in anyway fault this amazing hotel for couples and family alike we have booked another holiday again to stay hear we feel so at home and welcomed we do not have one negative comment to make thanks again so much. For a brilliant stayMr Basso. Obrigado
Feb 2016,40,10 day winter break for rest and relaxation!,"Wonderful hotel experience during January in this 5* hotel overlooking its own beach on the edge of Albufeira.  The spa was spacious and had lots of different choices.  Spa treatments were also available.  The dining was wonderful and I certainly recommend the half-board option which does not limit the diner in any way.  Breakfast was superb with as many choices as you could want, including freshly maid omelettes, made to order fried eggs, light options, pastries, and much, much more.  Certainly, the best hotel breakfast selection I have ever seen, even surpassing cruise dining.  The evening selection was excellent, and although there for a week, I did not exhause the menu choices.  Staff were very helpful and professional, and the bedrooms with sea-views, spacious and very comfortable.  Waking up to the sight of the Praia da Santa Eulalia was a great treat.  The occasional free return shuttle bus into the centre of town was an added bonus.  The hotel had calming music in the evenings in the main foyer, and everything combined for a wonderful 10 days of rest and relaxation.  In Jan., the weather was mild and bright, and the hotel was not overly busy.   Super stay!  Super Hotel!  Super Spa!"
Feb 2016,50,Fab break at this lovely hotel,"My husband and I have just returned from a short break at this hotel.  We absolutely loved the hotel.  Got upgraded to a sea view room.  The hotel itself is lovely, the staff are great and the breakfast was brilliant.  It's location is perfect, a short walk to the new town and easy distance in a taxi to the old town.  Despite the hotel being very quiet at this time of year it still provides regular shuttles to and from the old town via the new town.  I would love to experience this hotel in the spring / summer time when it is fully up and running i.e. pool bars open, people around the pools, music etc as I would imagine it would be fabulous.  It was a little quiet during our stay but that is because we went out of season.  The private beach attached is beautiful and we were fortunate enough to experience some lovely sunshine while we were there.  There isn't a huge amount open in the new and old towns, but plenty enough to occupy yourself for a short stay.  Would love to return at some point."
Feb 2016,50,Flawless,"This hotel was worth every penny spent. The staff were very polite and couldn't help us enough, it was almost as if nothing was too much trouble. The food was fantastic, cooked to perfection and very tasty.We had breakfast included with our price and there was such a great variety, from fruit to bacon and eggs. We used the spa pool one day, it was a heated salt water pool and extremely relaxing. They have many outdoor pools as well which were all very clean.Our room was also very nice, and the view was brilliant. I can't find a bad word to say about any part of this hotel or our stay, I'd highly recommend a stay here!"
Jan 2016,50,Excellent place to unwind,"I stayed here for 3 nights with my wife & had a very good experience.It was my plan to celebrate my birthday at a place where we could just relax & unwind without focusing on anything else & this place gave us the perfect getaway just for that.Like a resort, it offers plentiful to do within the property and also has a private beach. A proper indoor restaurant (with the option to sit outside but it was a bit difficult in January due to slightly cold weather in the evening), a bar, a restaurant facing & nearer to the beach, a full fledged spa, a smaller gaming room, activities all throughout the week and we could not ask for more. The beach was good & we walked & saw few beautiful sunsets.  The free wifi is also good. We had booked a sea facing room with a balcony and it was perfect just to be read a book during afternoon or enjoy a drink in the evening sitting there. The room was clean & of good size with a comfortable bed & good bathroom. Balcony is something that I crave for & it was really good here.The buffet breakfast was good with ample options. We had lunch in the restaurant nearer to the beach and the food was good although with limited menu options. The best part was enjoying coffee & seeing the sunset from here. We generally had dinner in the main restaurant (as the other one closes at 6.30 i think) and enjoyed our meals. The menu is slightly limited in options & it gets full mark with the taste & especially with the presentation. The presentation was really good & the staff was all professional. The bar was also great with good options. The room service menu is good which we tried couple of time. There is a small charge for it and the option after 12 AM is limited.We also used outside swimming pool once after the beach & it was another great experience of seeing the sunset from there.On the last day of our stay, we enjoyed the swimming pool in the spa & it was really good. With different options to relax & unwind on the pool, it was a great experience and something we thought we should have tried earlier. It was very relaxing. The staff was very good & helpful. They were polite, ready to help & also took care on arranging a half a day jeep safari. Infact, most of the activities could be booked from the reception itself. Kudos to them.The resort is around half an hour from Faro airport with shared or private transfer. We got shared transfer from the airport while we arrived here and got a cab while going back. The reception only book private transfers so one could book the to & from from the airport itself for shared transport. For private vehicle, there was plenty of space but I am not aware about any charges.There are couple of small supermarkets in walking distance. I do not remember the name of nearest market but it is around 15 minutes walk with plenty of restaurants, bars & shops.Overall, we had a fabulous experience which we would like to repeat & highly recommend to others."
Jan 2016,20,Not what expected,"Here with my husband and family (all adults) we thought this would be a lovely winter holiday as we know the algarve very well and friends said this was a good hotel, how disapointed we are not 5* by a long shot, there seems to be about 6 conventions going on so the half dozen people here on holiday sat by the pool it feels like were gate crashing an office reunion maybe this hotel should be closed to tourist in jan/feb ..Hotel staff very good 5* for them .."
Jan 2016,50,"Amazing Hotel, perfect for a relaxing break!","Stayed here with my girlfriend in September 2015 for 3 nights and didn't want to come home! The hotel itself looks five star, very clean, very upmarket and situated right next to the beach. We took a shared transfer from the airport, and were the envy of all the other passengers when we arrived at the hotel. The hotel is perfectly situated, far enough not to be bothered by loud music or rowdy stag and hen parties, and close enough to get to the main town in a taxi for around €5. We opted to stay in a Standard room with a Sea view and were definitely not disappointed. Honestly, the pictures on the website do not do it justice. The room itself was large and spacious with a comfortable bed, fridge, large wardrobe and a balcony overlooking the beach. The bathroom was large and nicely finished too.The staff were very friendly and welcoming and always willing to help where they could. There are a few places to eat onsite and room service if you really want, but I recommend taking a short trip into town and trying Sizzeling Steak and Kebab Restaurant...very tasty.All in all a very nice place to be although not the cheapest."
Jan 2016,40,Great hotel,"We stayed at the hotel for 6 days in May as a last minute break without much knowledge or expectation of the area.The hotel provided a perfect place to relax while being close enough to local town centres. It is located on the front of a public beach, but as it's the only hotel on that beach it didn't feel overcrowded. The other guests were a mixture of families, couples and groups yet managed to have an atmosphere that suited all types. Food in the various restaurants was a good quality and the cocktail bar was great with really good staff. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern. Highly recommend this hotel."
Jan 2016,50,"Great hotel, great price, nice appartment","Visited the Grande Real Hotel in Januari and the weather was great. Once we arrived (late in the evening) we were greated nicely and received our keys promptly. A driver with a golf car drove before us so we could park our car in the underground parking. He then took our luggage and drove us with our luggage to our appartment. It was nicely decorated, had a great view of the pool (no sea views in the appartments). We had all kinds of utensils for cooking etc. We arranged our own breakfast each day (intermarche three minutes away) because the hotel charges 20 euros a person for breakfast. The apartments are cleaned every day and the ladies also do the dishes :-) We had a one bedroom appartment and bith the bedroom as the living room has an airconditioning.We had two minor issues, one was the microwave / grill, it only does that, so no oven function. That would have been greatly appreciated, this way cooking was more difficult. Second thing was that we requested a quiet room with a view. The view was great but there was a private residence nearby with a great big water feature. And that water feature makes a lot of noise if you're in an appartment. We thought after the first night it had rained the while night, it did not, it was the neighbours. After a few nights we did not notice it anymore.Location wise, the hotel is on the beach and close to a road with some shops and restaurants. The old center of Albufeira is about an hours walk away (one way). We had a car and then it's a ten minute drive. The strip is about half an hour walk away.One thing to keep in mind is that in January a lot of shops and restaurants are closed. So you really have to  search for an open place. All in all we had a great ten days and were once again buggied with our lugguage this morning!"
Jan 2016,40,"Good value, great location",Spent 4 nights here between Xmas and new yr. Good value and nice breakfast. Had ocean facing room- bit basic and tired but clean and comfortable. Used the spa for massage which was great but if u want to use indoor pool and steam room etc you have to pay (20euro an hr) which is not mentioned on the website. Also I had to pay 5 euros to use an iron- which is something I have never had to do in all my time travelling in any other hotel!!!Buffet food in the evening was not great but a la carte was ok. Nice little bar and only a short taxi ride to old town. Private beach is lovely. Gym is free to use but very limited equipment.Overall good value- not what I would call 5 star so don't expect too much .
Jan 2016,50,Great place to stay.,"Just returned. This resort is beautiful. The staff are so courteous and helpful. The desk staff helped us with multiple things such as meals, room/card keys (when we forgot to bring it out with us), bus time tables and arranging transfers etc etc. Nothing was ever too much for any of the staff. We actually discussed the fact that we couldn't find a fault with the resort - only that sometimes we could hear furniture being moved around on the tiled floors above (which was not that often) but that is more down to other guests being a bit inconsiderate at silly times in the night, This is not something the resort could fix unless they carpeted the floors. The resort has everything you need, food is delicious and our apartment (we chose a one bedroom apartment) was immaculately clean with ample towels provided. The maid even washed up our tea cups one morning (not expected but was very considerate). Peaceful surroundings and access to the beach by a walk out of the back of the hotel to a bay which is just lovely. We just cant praise this hotel enough. Pictures of this resort does not do it justice really - was much nicer than we expected. Gorgeous and we will be back some day for sure if we are ever in Algarve in the future. Many thanks.The only unfortunate thing was that this is low season and not much open but with that said, we found things to do. Walk a lot along the beaches and cliff tops. Really loved the trips we took to Silves, Lagos and Loule. Saturday morning market in Loule is a good trip out and at the moment if you book two tours, lots of the ticket offices give you a free trip to market on a saturday morning which was great. Take the free bus from the resort to the old town Albufeira and walk back - will take about 45 mins but is a nice walk back. Albufeira has a lovely beach - all beaches are really clean. Dont go to Faro on a sunday (lots closed this time of year) - but do go on a weekday - It is lovely and the public bus service seems easy to navigate. I highly recommend a tour to Monchique - if you go, look out for the thousands and thousands of Storks that are nesting all around that area right now- stunning sight to see!! All the people are so warm and friendly, you will have a lovely time whatever you do."
Jan 2016,40,Needs a bit of a facelift,"After staying here for the 2nd time after New Year we were a little disappointed with the state of the bedrooms.We booked a sea view,which was lovely but the room itself was really past its sell by date.Definitely needed some t.l.c.Lighting is really bad for such a large room,carpet needed cleaning or replacing and furniture very tired.Tge hotel itself is lovely but even that needs new lights as its very dark in reception.It would have been nice to have the evening buffet every night,buwere put on a la carte after the first night and it is very limited.Got a bit tedious after 3 nights. All in all we enjoyed our short break but wont be going again next year."
Jan 2016,40,Really great place,"Great location, fantastic staff, excellent food and very family friendly. Some of us stayed in the hotel while others stayed in the apartments which are part of the same complex If there  is one quibble, it would be that the Hotel suite was beginning to look tired and  in need of freshening up - but that minor matter was more than made up for by the friendless and professionalism of the staff"
Jan 2016,50,Surprise after Surprise!,We loved this resort! From the sign with the stars at the entrance to the most courteous staff at the front desk. It was a joy to stay here. We had a beautiful room with a whole wall of windows. We opened the sliding door onto a beautiful patio with table and chairs and a fabulous view of the ocean to the right. The room had wonderful dark chocolates on our pillows. The bath was quite large. Breakfast was included and it was the best breakfast in any resort I have ever had. Unbelievable!
Jan 2016,50,great stay,"We spent a week here with our two-year old. A great resort with a wonderful, extremely helpful staff. Our room was a bit worn, but very clean, and the rest of the property was beautiful. Albufeira was also a great ""home base"" for exploring the Algarve. Would happily return!"
Dec 2015,50,Lovely hotel. Great location,"Travelled with wife, son, daughter in law and baby grandson using Jet2. Rep at airport congratulated my wife on booking the best hot in Albufeira  (and she was right). We were allocated 1st floor apartment across car park from hotel. Well decorated and very large. 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with additional sofa bed. Small kitchen and dining area and balcony. We even had a  jacuzzi in our bath! Apartment was thoroughly cleaned every day and towels sheets and towels changed daily. Beach towels can be remted st reception and changef daily. There was a large pool and separate kids pool at the apartments and we were usually the only ones at it during what is their Off Season. Hotel is very modern and on several levels. Lots of quirky furniture to laze about on. Food is buffet style and mainly Portuguese but we loved it (no chips or kiddies meals). Hotel is in a bay with a beautiful beach and a great café / bar halfway down numerous steps. I would not recommend to anyone with disabilities. Not much entertainment but it was November and we had the place nearly to ourselves. Courtesy bus is available or taxi to Albuferia or Vilamoura can be ordered at reception. This is a 5 star hotel and some UK travellers complained that it should only be a 4. But we could not faukt it. Would I stay again?  Definitely. Would I recommend it? Only to someone willing try something different - not for people who only eat 'English Food'...."
Dec 2015,40,lovely autumn break,"Four nights at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia. Very welcoming staff, polite, friendly but not overbearing.Sea view standard room, spacious, spotlessly clean and comfortable. Big bathroom, balcony with great views.Fantastic buffet breakfast, huge selection of fresh fruit, pastries, hot breakfast items, cereals, cheeses and cured meats.Lovely beach.Good wifi connection ... included.Will return"
Dec 2015,50,simply beautiful,"My wife and I had a great stay here for 4 nights. We had a sea view room which was recommended to us by other trip advisor reviews and WOW it was stunning.The room was lovely although it needed a few 'touchup's' (eg: wall paper peeling off). In all fairness, I do believe they are updating the hotel, hence we could not stay on the top floor. Fair enough....oh and we did not hear a squeek of construction noise even though the top floor was being renovated. top marks there! The spa was beautiful and relaxing, (even though some stations were not working) we spent a good 3 hours in there just unwinding. I think its about 18 euro's per person, not many people seemed to use it so we enjoyed the exclusivity. The only thing I would say that spoilt the experience was the steam room which smelt a bit...off... some eucalyptus scent in there would be a nice simple fix.  My wife is pure veg (no meat, fish, eggs and even no cheese containing animal renete (I hadn't got a clue what that was until I met her)). The veg options were ok for breakfast and somewhat limited to pizza and creamy pasta, although it was very nice and the service was good.Staff are very friendly and helpful and we felt well looked after by them. The private beach is just sublime. free wifi is great too! (this should be made a human right imho lol) dont let a few niggles put you off, the stay was lovely and we shall definately be coming back next time."
Dec 2015,50,Last minute super deal and super experience ,"We booked 4 nights at the hotel and after seeing the reviews on here we were not disappointed. All the staff were helpful and food was excellent.  We had dinner one evening and had traditional offerings in the menu which was great to see. Our room had a fantastic view over the beach and was very clean and comfortable.  The spa was a nice treat too. Evening entertainment was also brilliant, great musicians! The beach just a stones through was beautiful and quiet. Very happy guests."
Dec 2015,40,November trip,Visited in late November. Lovely and quiet and the weather was good (18C most days which helped!). Large hotel which could get busy in summer I imagine but perfect for our visit. We stayed in the self-catering apartments which were lovely and spacious (limited crockery and no pans so not sure how you cook!) with a microwave grill and hob. Rooms cleaned every day to a high standard. Cannot fault the service we received. Pools were clean although the outdoor heated pool was a cool 27C but still good for a swim in the early afternoon. Great location with access to the public Santa Eulalia beach which was very quiet at this time of year. Easily accessed from Albufeira and Faro airport.
Dec 2015,50,Great place for family vacation,"I realy enjoyed staying here with my children - there are lovely restaurants, great ocean view and beach and excellent program of entertainments arranged by the hotel. Looking forward to come back! Thank you all hotel and spa stuff for proffecionalism and providing wonderful relaxation and great time 💖"
Dec 2015,50,You just have to experience this place,"We were given a very warm welcome, assigned a sea view room, everything was spotless, spacious and most inviting. What a wonderful hotel, very tastefully decorated and laid out, the security was first class locked gates from the road but our card opened these and the gates onto the beach. There was an excellent cafe bar and restaurant right at the beach, 3 pools, spa, main restaurant and bar with bistro. I have just 2 exceptions, there was no entertainment at night but knew this was November and off season, also the bar prices were a bit stiff, which lead us to visit old town most nights."
Nov 2015,50,November Sun in a little piece of Heaven,"We have just had 7 days in the most wonderful hotel, Grande Real Santa Eulalia. The service from all the staff was wonderful and certainly was 5* quality.  They certainly loved their jobs and it showed. The hotel is situated in a very quiet area near Albufeira. Cleanliness was the order of the day everywhere. Food for breakfast could not be beaten and the quality of Fruit, Cheese, Bread, Cereal, Juices and Hot Food was excellent. Bucks Fizz for Breakfast and freely available was certainly the way to celebrate my birthday.  Later that day, I received a wonderful surprise with a bottle of Sparkling Wine and Birthday Cake sent to our room unannounced.  When I enquired how they knew about this, I was told we noted your birth-date on your passport.  That is what I call 5* treatment.  Our bedroom was large with linen change every day.  The balcony had a side view of the most wonderful panorama of Eulalia Beach.  Even though it was a quiet time of the year and some of the bars and sitting areas were closed, we had two patio areas to choose from and the beach area had a wonderful snack bar, open all day, with hot food until 6 pm.  We will definitely return to this little piece of heaven. A free shuttle bus to Albufeira was greatly appreciated."
Nov 2015,50,Great hotel in a  good location,We stayed at the hotel self catering in June 2015 for 1 week. The accommodation was very clean and each self catering accommodation block has its own pool. The rooms are well equipped for self catering.  The beach is down quiet steep steps but is really nice. To the right of the hotel after about 20 minutes walk there are some fantastic local restaurants are really reasonable prices well worth a visit. I would recommend this hotel.
Nov 2015,50,Very pleasant stay,"Just returned from Santa Eulalia and had a very enjoyable visit.We had a great view overlooking the the beach and out into the bay and  enjoyed listening to the waves breaking on the beach through the open balcony door.The room was clean and spacious with large double bed ,air-con,free wi-fi and safe.As it was mid-November the resort was very quiet and we had a relaxed stay.Breakfast and dinner each day were excellent- lots of choice and a wide variety of dishes.The resort is located some distance from the old town,which incidentally was badly flooded a few weeks before we arrived,and a free shuttle is provided 5 or 6 times a day which was very convenient.There is also a bus stop outside the gates which is very convenient for those wishing to visit Villamoura or Faro.The staff were extremely helpful and professional ,especially Marisa who was very knowledgeable,friendly and competent..I would recommend this resort to anyone looking for relaxing break"
Nov 2015,50,Really lovely Hotel & Aparments,"Stayed in Grande Real Santa Eulalia for 5 nights in September; got a great deal on booking.com. The hotel was spotless, staff were lovely especially the cleaning lady in the apartments. The private beach was lovely and the little cafe down by the beach had really nice lunch options. It was slightly away from the main town but the free courtesy bus is a real bonus. I brought a towel but the hotel provides you with complimentary towels to use by the pool- a nice gesture to save some room in your luggage.  It was very quiet when we were hear would love to return again maybe when they is more things happening in the hotel. We had a one bed apartment; it had everything you want when going self catering."
Nov 2015,50,Absolutely lovely...,"My husband & two young sons aged 4 and 8 stayed here for one week during half term, October 2015. We all had a thoroughly lovely time & cannot fault any part of our stay & experience. Due to the time of the year, the hotel was obviously quieter which suited us perfectly. Every member of staff we encountered was polite, friendly & helpful. We booked a sea view suite & it didn't disappoint. We were pleasantly surprised to find a two room suite, 2 balconies, 2 bathrooms, 2 bedrooms, 2 tv's - plenty of room for the four of us. The suite was clean & well maintained. The bed in bedroom 1 was absolutely huge & very comfortable. The fridge, WiFi & safe were very handy. Unlike other hotels we've stayed in, our suite was quiet & we weren't disturbed by late night noise. There was a martial arts tournament being hosted in the hotel on our arrival - this didn't really impact on us negatively. We stayed on a half board basis & were given flexible daily vouchers to use for either lunch or dinner. We used our vouchers for mainly dinner in the evening, the food was lovely & plentiful with a varied choice of hot & cold 3 course dishes. Breakfast was equally delicious, with a wide range on offer (hot, cooked 'full English', pastries, breads, cheese, meat, fresh fruit, cereal, juices, pancakes, champagne...) We didn't have to queue or wait once for a table. There was a selection of vegetarian foods available, as well as an a la Carte menu if required. On occasions we used other eateries & bar within the hotel, the food & drinks were always enjoyable & plentiful, expensive, but we were mindful we were staying in a 5* hotel. The hotel facilities were great, 3 outdoor pools, one large, one heated medium sized & a toddler paddling pool, all within close proximity of each other. There's a little shop/boutique within the hotel - bit pricey as expected but handy if required. The beach was literally a two minute walk through the hotel grounds & offered sunbed hire facilities, toilets & beach side café. We didn't use the hotel Spa although it looked lovely! We made use of the free shuttle mini-bus that takes guests into the new town & old town, although we found a taxi to/from the hotel (one way) was only around 7 Euros. There is a restaurant right next door to the hotel but not much else in close proximity. If you take a 15min walk uphill into town, there are restaurants, bars, gift shops & a decent supermarket where we stocked up on water, cold drinks & snacks. There was an excellent activity programme for the hotel's kids club, with a lovely play area & good facilities & equipment for children. We don't use kids clubs when on holiday & chose to stay with our children when they played. We did notice that the kids club was accessible via a unsecured, unsupervised wooden gate. We personally felt the kids club wasn't secure enough to prevent anyone from accessing the direct area where the children are. Aside that observation, we had a lovely, relaxed week, spending our time in the pool, on the beach & in town exploring. We wanted a relaxed half term break & we got exactly what we wanted. Had we stayed longer, we would have considered hiring a car to explore further afield but really didn't feel the need to. To summarise, the weather was sunny & warm, hotel although very big was spotless, comfortable, friendly & we would happily stay here again. Highly recommended."
Nov 2015,40,Beautiful hotel - 2 bed apartment,Great hotel - very professional throughout - daily changes of towels and bedding - only breakfast I have ever had where champagne is on the buffet to make your own bucks fizz!  Downside - main restaurant very expensive and not many alternatives without getting a taxi.
Nov 2015,30,It could have been 5 stars...,"Like previous reviewers, I experienced the kick boxing 'shananigans', fortunately we were sleeping away from them, so I wasn't too bothered.  I travelled with my 16 yr old daughter - had I been with a younger child I would have been bothered. Thats one reason for marking down. The other being the road.  Its quite busy, & I imagine with young kids to keep an eye on it would be quite a stressful walk into town. Staff were very friendly/helpful.  Pool on the small side, there are several dotted around,  but the one nearest us had seagulls in it more than people,  so that put me off for hygiene reasons! Indoor pool is part of spa, so costs to enter(it is nice though).  I had a wonderful pilates class (free), tennis (10€). Beach is lovely,  but not Mediterranean, so would be hesitant of allowing little children in. One good tip if you have an early flight home. They will bring you breakfast to the room (free!) you just need to get up early enough to eat it!!"
Nov 2015,50,Fabulous Hotel... We will be back ,"Travelled here for 9 nights and must say I think most of the staff are very helpful and the hotel is fantastic...The reception staff could not be more helpful - one day my costume and towel had blown off our suite balcony onto the roof below... Reported to reception and later that day they had been returned to the room freshly laundered! Not many hotels would do that... From my past experience..Sea view suite no 247 was fantastic... We were very pleased... 2 Seperate rooms and 2 bathrooms, balconies etc...Food in hotel was varied with plenty of choice, however some of the afternoon staff were a bit miserable and on our last day my mum never got her meal and we had to leave to catch our transfer coach and she really wasn't bothered - this was the only bad part we found... We had half board and they issue you with vouchers which you can use either for the afternoon a la carte menu of the evening buffet if you decided to eat elsewhere on any day... Breakfast - couldn't think of anything you couldn't get (even sparkling wine every morning!)My only criticism is the lack of entertainment 3 evenings a week - male singer was very good, however music with Betty made me feel like I was on the Titanic waiting to sink!!! And the dancers were appalling both Saturday nights that we watched them... As the complex is out of the way I feel some shows would be better entertainment is needed (however that is purely my own view)Loved our 9 nights there and will definitely return...We left the day of the thunderstorms and flooding and thought we would not make it back to the airport!Well done Grand Real Santa Eulalia... Excellent service and facilities see you again soon 🌞"
Oct 2015,30,2 night stay ,Stayed here for 2 nights it was all going well until the world kickboxing / kararate championship started ! Luckily it was on our last day they all started arriving complete mayhem round the pool felt very sorry for people with young children as it was just taken over by teenagers running riot . The management did try to calm things down a little . Thank goodness we wasn't there for their entire stay . Lovely hotel otherwise with very nice rooms overlooking the sea . The breakfast was very nice usual buffet selection . Evening buffet was ok . I was very surprised that a supposedly 5* hotel would accommodate a kickboxing championship it would have been better held at the sister hotel the real bellavista !
Oct 2015,40,Relaxing break,"We had visited the hotel on a previous visit to Albufeira and picked it as a quiet relaxing luxury hotel. Our room was great - quiet and clean with fabulous views.  We were really grateful for a quiet room as the World Kickboxing Championships were held at the hotel (we hadnt realised this!) and the feel of the place was definitely affected by this.  We had no gounds for complaint as we were not disturbed by the 100+ kickboxers and families who arrived but we were aware that public places became much noisier and less appealling!Our only gripe was that there should be an adult only area in the restaurant - or at the very least, the waiters should be briefed to pick appropriate seating areas for guests.  The atmosphere at dinner was marred by the many small children around who were rushing up to get more icecream and shouting out to their parents etc.   We tried eating later but the kids were up late too!!  We did ask on one occasion if we could sit somewhere away from the families and the waiters did seat us in a quieter spot - which we much appreciated!  We would certainly consider staying at this hotel again but we would be wanting to avoid British school holidays or any large conventions."
Oct 2015,10,"Lovely hotel, horrible experience","Hotel lovely but the world kickboxing championship was held in the hotel which we weren't made aware of before hand and when the British team arrived it was no longer peaceful, ran riot around the hotel and management did nothing despite complaints being made. No peace and quiet at all could be had at the pool or in the common area. Furniture thrown in pool and indoor furniture thrown around the place while contestants of all ages ran screaming shouting and roaring around the hotel. Screaming and roaring at all hours of the night in the corridors. Tried to use the indoor pool as outside was full of drunks but they wanted to charge us €21 for the pleasure. Also got a massage and was left with bruises all over my arms. So disappointed this was supposed to be a romantic getaway in 5 star hotel and it was spoiled"
Oct 2015,50,Great holiday,"The hotel was wonderful and my husband and I enjoyed our sty and hope to return again. We went in October 2015 and had some rain and cooler weather. It was a shame that there was only one heater pool as it was filled with kids and we were not able to get in. Also, would have liked alternative options for dinner apart from the buffet. Breakfast was delicious."
Oct 2015,40,Very good hotel,"Visited the hotel in October and we were lucky enough to have very good weather. We stayed at half board and over the course of our stay visited the restaurant at breakfast, lunch and evening meal - The food was outstanding also the staff. Beach facilities are spot on and very close to hotel just down a path. Only criticism would be the pools..3 pools but not what I would class as pools more like plunge pools. For the size of the resort the pools would not be adequate for the number of people staying."
Oct 2015,50,Very nice,The hotel was lovely very clean lovely big  rooms very good breakfast beautiful dinningroom very helpful staff  and shuttle bus all very good the running time where very good very clean and well look after poolside
Oct 2015,40,Hotel and Resort was acceptable,"I stayed here 3 weeks ago for 12 days for our honeymoon. I booked a suite thinking it would be something special. What i expect a suite to be and what they call a suite is totally different. We ended up in a self catering one bedroom apartment. It was clean, decor was rather dated and had ants in kitchen area which i didnt like. Expensive to drink at pool area, quiet and staff pleasant"
Oct 2015,40,Santa Eulalia,"This hotel is very good, The Staff in all areas are very good BUT the hotel seems to be more interested in business customers for meetings and conferencesPaying guests [Holidaymakers] are moved to small sections of the dinning area to suit meeting attenders sometimes rude and noisey"
Oct 2015,50,Top Class Hotel,"Very good all round. Only slight disappointment was pool closure when we were there and being asked to pay for internal pool usage at same time?  Overall we will definitely go back though. Rooms beautiful, breakfast fantastic and plenty of it, views amazing, good staff, lovely surroundings"
Oct 2015,50,Great 3 nights ,"We stayed at this wonderful resort and hotel after being upgraded due to our original hotel being oversubscribed There were 16 of us having 8 twin rooms or should I say apartments and for us the accommodation was simply superb The hotel staff were so helpful, I lost my phone one night in a taxi coming back from albufeira and the staff couldn't be more helpful with me having my phone returned after they rang round the taxi firms for me The facilities were great the bar at times was a little too busy for us to get served as quick as we'd have liked and 3 euro 50 for a Pepsi is....., well just a rip off But small complaints really the whole setting near the sea and the many varied landscapes just on site made this a place I would whole heartedly recommend to anyone"
Oct 2015,40,Good quality and good value,"Just returned from a week here and we were pleased with most aspects of the hotel with just a few minor niggles that stops me giving it a 5 star rating. Staff were excellent, helpful and polite. First class service from them. Breakfast was good although the odd change variety change would have been welcomed. As it is not close to evening entertainment sites more entertainment could have been provided on site as the hotel was relatively full despite just being out of season. Great beach. Accommodation was good but not sure about the paved, external cobble stone surface throughout which was a problem for some people with mobility problems. Actual studio accommodation was clean and well maintained. Nice touch with the surprise champagne and cake for my partner's birthday. She was quite chuffed. Disappointed we had to pay for the swimming pool in the spa. There were 3 or 4 outside ones with adjoining kiddie ones adjoining them, one heated. Will definitely be going back and taking the grandchildren with us next time."
Oct 2015,40,Amazing boutique hotel that thinks it's a resort,"This hotel has everything going for it: excellent location, friendly staff, lots of facilities and clean and safe environment.  Unfortunately, it also has capacity issues for its amenities.This was to be our honeymoon destination for a week, and we alerted the hotel ahead of time, via the booking site we used.  The room was prepared ahead of time, in a romantic style, and the hotel provided a bottle of champagne and sweet treats as welcome treat. Thus began our wonderful week and excellent relationship between us and the staff at the reception desk.  We appreciated many aspects of the hotel, in particular:* Location: The hotel sits on top of the Santa Eulalia beach.  Even though the beach is public, it is dwarfed by better known beaches on every side, and as such it wasn't full of people.  On low tide, we could walk to other beaches towards Albufeira.  In addition, the hotel is only about 10 minutes walking from The Strip, the New Town bar and restaurant area.  This provided for plenty of evening entertainment for us.  Finally, at under 8 Euros per taxi (or free shuttle a few times per day), Albufeira old town was within easy distance.* Staff: The staff at the reception desk and the poolside bar were very attentive and friendly.  It took us a few mornings to establish some sort of rapport with the restaurant staff, but they also warmed up to us.  The staff at the spa was exceptional - very friendly and very competent.  We really enjoyed going there.* Safety and cleanliness: The hotel, including our room, was well maintained and always clean.  The resort is gated, and even though it would have been easy to sneak in, we never felt unsafe there.* Facilities: The hotel offered plenty of amenities, from tennis courts to a spa, massage rooms, gym and a free shuttle to the city and back.  In addition, nearly any ticket for local attractions could be purchased at the reception desk.* Food: We only took advantage of the breakfast, but we very very satisfied at the quality and quantity of food.  We experienced no queues, and all food was readily available.Unfortunately, we experienced several drawbacks, which individually didn't account to much, but taken together hint at serious capacity issues at the hotel.  Given that these problems occurred off-season, when the hotel was not full, guests at high season may experience them more severely.  In particular:* WiFi: We didn't use the Internet too much, spending most of our time paying attention to each other.  However, when we tried to use it, connecting sometimes took a long time and the speed was very slow.  I did a little debugging and determined that the WiFi network in the hotel simply couldn't handle so many devices being connected at the same time.* Gym: For a hotel of its size, it was tiny.  Of the two treadmills, one was permanently broken and the other worked only sometimes.  When more than five guests were there at the same time, people started waiting for equipment.* Shuttle: The hotel offers a free shuttle to Albufeira, a few times per day.  However, in our experience, even queuing for twenty minutes before the bus was due would not necessarily guarantee a spot on the shuttle.* Atlantic Bar: Not a capacity problem, but a staffing one.  We used to come here for a quick lunch, as this was the only facility around with small enough food at reasonable prices.  However, the staff here was very slow even at the regional standards.  Several times they disappeared for so long that we had to go looking for them to either order or get our bill.  Had there been a reasonable alternative, we would not come back here after our first meal.  This place was definitely the lowest point of our experience.* Coffee: A small pet peeve of me: The coffee at the bar and the poolside bar should be declared a crime against humanity.All in all, though, we were very pleased with our stay.  We paid extra for a upper floor room with beach and sunset view, but we did not regret it.  For couples with small needs other than a bed, beach and short trips in the area, this hotel is ideal."
Oct 2015,50,Great self-contained holiday resort,"A fantastic choice if you're looking for a relaxing holiday with everything you need on site. We stayed (with young baby) for 7 nights in the first week of October, on half-board, booked a garden view studio but received a complimentary upgrade to a garden apartment. Accommodation: Perfect for families. Probably the cleanest rooms I've ever stayed in, and cleaned daily by friendly staff. In-apartment wifi was complimentary and very fast. In-room safe also complimentary. A/C worked fine, although we weren't in the heat of summer. Having our own fridge was very handy, as was having a bedroom separate from the kitchen/lounge for the baby's early nights. Our apartment had a patio area that backed out onto one of the pool areas.Food: For half-board, you're given vouchers, which can be used for either the lunch or dinner buffet. We only used for dinner, but some people may appreciate the flexibility to choose - or to use 2 vouchers on the same day if you're doing any full-day trips off site. The breakfast buffet is the same each day, that I could tell, with continental and ""British"" options, lovely pastries, etc. Although not signposted, you can order freshly made omelets, etc, by asking the staff. The dinner buffet had decent variety for mains and deserts. We ate lunch at the cafe overlooking the private beach a couple of times, which was decent and not too expensive.Resort: Has multiple pool areas (although only the small pool at the main complex is heated, so suitable for young children out of summer), poolside snack/drink bars, multiple on-site restaurants (including one on the beach), a couple of small gift shops, and a spa complex on the basement floor. And, not forgetting, it backs onto a  beautiful (private?) beach. If you're travelling with a stroller, pram or wheelchair, you can get from the resort all the way to the beach without having to navigate any steps, although we only worked this out after a few days (instead of heading through the card-accessed gate via the cafe to the beach, head down the driveway towards the beach carpark, where you can buzz for them to open the gate to let you through, after which there's wooden ramps onto the beach). The complex itself is very pretty, with well-tended gardens and well-furnished common areas, etc.Location: The resort is east of the town of Albufeira, with not a lot of restaurants, shops or bars in the immediate vicinity. This may be an issue if you're self catering, although the resort puts on complimentary shuttle buses to and from the new and old town areas several times a day. Other than that, it's about a 10-15 minute walk westwards to the edge of the new town area, where you can find supermarkets, bars and cafes. It's only about 10-15 minutes drive into the old town, so taxis back would probably be cheap enough if you're out late.Staff: All the staff we dealt with were professional and friendly.Overall: Very good choice for families with young children (in terms of accommodation options, shallow pools, good catering options) and for couples looking for a relaxing holiday. Very impressed, and would definitely recommend. Would also recommend start of October as a great time to visit - warm with a decent amount of sun during the day, but cool and comfortable for meals and sleeping (especially getting kids to sleep!) in the evening."
Oct 2015,50,Holiday,"Just got back yesterday and the holiday blues have kicked in already.!!The staff where so helpful at the hotel reception to cleaners friendly polite and very very helpful nothing seemed to be a problem for them.We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment with a pool literally metres from our back terrace which was great, clean light and air con in the rooms as well.Really good position for going different places with either a cheap taxi ride into the old town or free shuttle bus that runs every hourish, local bus stop outside the entrance to the resort. All the excursions pick up points are outside the resort going in either direction so a fantastic position.The resort is very clean and quiet with lovely views out onto the beach and out to sea which truely where remarkable.Prices in the restaurants in the resort where a little bit pricey but good if you went half board bed breakfast etc. Serving up local dishes which was good. You have the options to go outside of the resort with some lovely places nearby to eat and drink.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the grande real santa eulalia and have already booked again for next year.My only complaint would be that we only booked for 9 days this time.!!"
Oct 2015,30,Not what I expected. ,Disappointed. The hotel rooms may have been 5* but apartments and food were not. I have stayed in better 4*. Booked a studio apartment with breakfast option. Ate only 1 breakfast and it was passable. The 'hot' food was barely warm. Fried eggs cooked in advance and left on hot plate. Had one evening meal €32 each - again poor choice and barely warm. Had rest of meals in town. Staff were great. Free bus to town 4 times a day. Apartment: compact; reasonably equipped; no iron & board; cleaned every day; bed was awful - mattress & pillows covered in a plastic or rubber so apart from hot and uncomfortable also noisy when turning over. Worst bed I've slept in at a hotel. Would go back to albufeira but not this hotel.
Oct 2015,50,Amazing hotel,Slightly delayed review but i stayed here with my partner in April this year and was very impressed. We didn't pay much for our self catering room but upgraded when we arrived and saw what a beautiful position the hotel was in. The sea view room was definitely worth the money.Staff were polite and helpful. Breakfast was fantastic. Location is peaceful yet within easy reach of the town. Would we stay here again...100% yes!
Oct 2015,50,Excellent hotel in lovely position,"We chose this hotel as it was apart from Albufeira but provides a shuttle service. I booked a sea view suite, which had a lovely outlook and was very spacious. The staff were all very courteous and the restaurant buffet was, we think, very good value, with a good selection of dishes available.A very relaxing stay in one of the best hotels in this area with a beautiful stretch of beach. We will be returning here next year.One tip - if you want to miss the queues try arriving early - we had breakfast at 8am and dinner at 7pm and there were no queues at all."
Oct 2015,30,Average at best!,"This hotel is in a good location and has the potential to be an excellent spot but is let down by a few things that make a big difference.The hotel building is probably up to about the standard of a 4 star establishment abroad and the rooms are of a good size,come with a fridge and aircon. They are let down by the fact that there is no tea or coffee making facility or complimentary water which is surprising for a 5 star rating.The location is great for the beach which is accessed from the grounds via a gate. The pools are far too small for an hotel this size and are more like plunge pools then swimming pools. We went half board but the food was a diappointment and not anywhere near a 5 star more 2 star. The price of drinks however were 5 star!It is only a 15 to 20 minute walk to the town of Eulalia where there are plenty of places to eat and drink and local supermarkets and all reasonably priced.A free shuttle bus takes guests to and from Albufeira which is only a 10 to 15 minute drive away.Evening entertainment not evident and the general feeling of the place was that it was more of a hotel then a resort, when we stopped there was a conference going on so it was half occupied by these people rather than holidaymakers. Not a bad place but I have stayed at alot better not claiming to be 5 star."
Oct 2015,40,Not so grande,"Stayed at this hotel from 5th sept.- 19th sept,let me start by saying that this is not a 5star hotel,at best it is a good 4star hotel.I suppose when the hotel was opened it maybe was 5star, but not now, as it needs some refurbishment work done to it,it is a bit tired in places.my wife and I were booked into a studio on a half board basis,and when we checked in we were upgraded to a one bedroom apartment,which was a nice surprise.The apartment itself 437(ground floor) was ideal and nicely decorated,but outside on the patio the table and chairs are needing to be replaced,also the pagoda style roof above the patio is in need of repair and decoration.Although the apartment was kept clean by the maids,they sometimes left the patio doors and/ or left the window unlocked,not good for security.The food in the restaurant was definitely not 5star quality,breakfast was good with plenty of choice,but if you liked fried eggs, I would give them a miss as they were over cooked,or maybe that should be frazzled,due to being cooked at to high a temperature,don't expect that in a5star hotel.Dinner was ok not a big choice of main meals,although we never went hungry. beautiful restaurant with nice sea views.The only downside in the restaurant was the sometimes chaotic queues,with people trying to get hot and cold food.The staff in the hotel were generally friendly and helpful,but there were others who would hardly speak to you,for example when we were in the restaurant having our meals,we made a point of thanking the staff for clearing our table,unfortunately some of staff would completely ignore us,but the majority of the restaurant staff were very nice.Beach at hotel is very nice,but is also a public beach.Would we stay here again,probably not,stayed in better 4/5star hotels."
Oct 2015,50,Wonderful holiday marred only by the theft of a swimming costume,"We had booked a one bedroom apartment with breakfast at this hotel for seven nights through British Airways. Including return flights from Gatwick; the cost was about £600pp, which we feel is excellent value for money. I have stayed in two excellent hotels before – the Sheraton in Antalya (Turkey) and The Celtic Manor (Wales). I truly feel the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa is slightly better than either of them (OK, it does not have a golf course like the Celtic Manor but knocking small balls into holes in a lawn has never appealed to me as a useful way to spend my time but then again, it does have a beach).Access is from the street is via gates with automatic rising barriers. I am not sure if this is an adequate security feature since every vehicle seems to be admitted without question or challenge and pedestrians can easily walk around them. There is a dedicated pedestrian access through a gate house but most people seem to walk around the road barriers.Check in was quick, efficient and friendly and we were transferred promptly to our apartment (413) with our luggage by buggy. We were very impressed with the apartment. The décor was very acceptable and the standard of cleanliness was excellent. The bed was massive (probably 2 metres wide) although the mattress was a little short of comfortable padding – but we slept well enough on it. The only other slight irritation was the two hanging bed-side lamps that were so low that we kept knocking into them and they could not be moved or adjusted for height. The wardrobe space was perfectly adequate and there was a second wardrobe in the living room. We were glad of the provision of a secure safe for storage of valuables that was particularly easy to programme and use. The living room was spacious and had a table, four chairs, a single bed and a settee that may have been converted into an additional bed (not checked). Behind folding doors there was a galley type of kitchen with all the fittings you would expect and plenty of dishes and utensils, cutlery etc. The television was most appreciated in the lounge and we were very glad that we could view Sky News and CNN in English and Euro Sport (in German and French). It would have been nice if other English language channels could have been available such as BBC1,2,3 and 4. The television in the bedroom did not seem to work but we did not need to use it so we did not pursue the matter. The bathroom was very brightly decorated with multi-coloured tiles, a large mirror, WC, bidet and a low sided bath with a shower over it. There was a nice patio (accessible through sliding doors from the living room) with a table and two chairs. However, because we were on the ground floor; there was no security for any items left on the patio – one night we left our swimming costumes (that we had just rinsed them out) to drip dry overnight and in the morning found that the woman’s one had been stolen. (My trunks were still there so I wonder if the thief was a ‘sniffer’)? We accept that we should have been more security conscious. We reported the theft to Reception who initially seemed to regard it as a lost property matter, so I put it in writing and gave them the costume’s neck strap that had not been fitted; so they had a record of the fabric pattern for identification, if needed. Breakfast in the main restaurant was excellent and we were particularly appreciative of the freely available sparkling white wine! The variety of the breakfast buffet food was extensive and of excellent quality – you could eat (and drink!) as much as you wanted and the staff were always attentive, friendly and helpful. The restaurant itself was spacious, airy and had glass walls on three sides. It was possible to take breakfast outside by the pool if desired. Lunch and Dinner could be had at the hotel but the cost seemed a bit expensive (although I have no doubt the quality would be good). Dinner was about £25 per person (mental arithmetic conversion from Euros). For a similar cost the two of us had perfectly delicious meals at the Restaurante Martins, just two minutes walk from the hotel gates.A free shuttle bus runs from the hotel Reception into Albufeira town and return during the day until 18.20 (from memory).  The taxi fare back from town is about 7 Euros. If you take the shuttle bus into town you must remember to get off at the second stop – the driver on our first venture spoke no English and did not announce the stop, so we were part way back to the hotel when we realised our mistake but at the third stop; the driver and one of the passengers went into a hotel together for a translation and he kindly returned to the bus and took us back into town. There isn’t much to do close outside the hotel. In both directions on the road there were some bars and shops about 10 – 15 minutes walk away.The pools were all circular and in pairs – an adult one with a children’s pool nearby with plenty of recliners and sun shades. Pool / beach towels were available free of charge from Reception in return for the black cards provided with the room key pack.We were told that the hotel had a private beach accessible through a gate using our room key-card. Access was easy and down a slope and some steps. The beach was lovely with soft sand and a fairly gently sloping access to the sea. When the tide was out the bottom was almost flat, meaning you could swim out quite a way and not be out of your depth. The sea water was calm and cool but not chilly (20 – 27 September). A pair of loungers with a sun shade was available at a cost of 15 Euros for all day to 6pm or 10 Euros after 2pm. We discovered that the beach was not private to the hotel however, as there was a public car park a bit further along it with full pedestrian access to the beach. There were two beach bar/cafes – one on the hotel site and another on the far side of the car park. Access back to the hotel was through the card operated gate, ensuring that only hotel guests could get through. There were life guards on the beach until about 6pm.In summary, this is a lovely hotel. Everywhere it was spotlessly clean and tidy and we would very much like to return."
Sep 2015,50,Excellent Base for Southern Portugal,"Excellent welcome and comprehensive guide to the Resort and Spa from the young Lady at reception started the visit off in excellent fashion.  The room was large and moor than adequate for our two night stay.  The chocolates on the pillow each night was a lovely touch that just about summed up the attention to detail.  The Fish restaurant was delightful but sadly only open for one of our two night stays.  The beach was close enough but still provided a little bit of exercise on the down and back.  We were made to feel secure as the key card was needed to gain access.  Parking was easy and plentiful including underground parking if required.  The only sad thing about it all was we had to leave but even that was warm, friendly and very efficient."
Sep 2015,50,Excellant Stay,"We have just returned from this Hotel we booked bed and breakfast, we stayed in a Studio Apartment 546, very spacious, lobby area, Kitchen with microwave, two rings, toaster, Kettle, cutlery, pots and pans and plates etc, table with 4 chairs, two sofas, coffee table, double bed with double wardrobe, safe, extra pillows, extra blankets and two bath robes.The Breakfast has plenty to choose from bacon, eggs, sausage, omelettes, beans, tomatoes, fresh bread, cheese, pancakes, fruit so much I cant remember all.Pools great clean plenty of loungers no need to rush to get one, pool bar good.Upstairs bar in the Hotel ok we wound have liked a bit more entertainment ie a dance night the entertainment was three nights a week a singer, a violinist who also sang and three Spanish women dancing.My sister in law and I went to the Spa great back massage."
Sep 2015,40,the jacksons in Portugal,"Gated entrance, looking good hotel very smart but !!! be aware,we booked a suite and got put into an ""apartment"" across the road from the hotel every colour in the world was used to paint this upmarket chalet.next morning first thing I was at the desk asking for the manager,but I got Catia the most charming and helpful young lady you could wish to meet nothing was to much trouble we got moved into a room,she made great efforts to find us a suite,but there where none,it did not help somebody telling us how good the suits where,service and food where very good the a la carte restaurant was good,but what made it was Catia (our white knight) we will be back,but don't get stuck with one of those ""APARTMENTS"""
Sep 2015,30,Not really a 5 star...,"We stay in the Santa Eulalia area regularly and have always wondered what this was like. We have also been lucky enough to stay at many 5-star hotels round the world, prompting the same question. So what did we find...Good - a nice setting, well kept grounds and - if you are new to the area, handy for golf, beaches and the huge variety of bars, restaurants and other entertainment that the area offers. Room spacious, clean and a comfy bed (come back to that one though), and the aircon works.Not So Good. Never turned up to 5 star and not had our bags brought in or been offered a complimentary drink on arrival. Staff seemed to ""process"" you, point you vaguely in the direction of your room and consider it job done. Poor. Totally confused by the restaurant arrangements. The welcome note in our room tells us about the fabulous Real Cozinha, the wide choice on offer, and invites us to reserve a table. ""Not possible"" comes the reply, ""must have six or eight""; we wanted a four - not unusual. So, we set out to find it, following the nicely printed map inside our room card holder, and ended up at the beach restaurant - yes, even the hotel don't know where their restaurants are! Having finally found Cozinha, deduced it is only a la carte in low season. The ""fine dining"" Perugla wasn't open during our stay at all. Ate out in local cantina, spot on.Bad. Pools are tiny for the size of hotel, and the decks around are way too packed as the hotel pools are the only ones with bars, so everyone from the apartments uses them too. Service is poor generally - check out time and we weren't even asked if we enjoyed our stay. Bottle of water in room on arrival day, never replenished.Overall. It's the little things that make the difference, especially when they're missing! This is not a bad hotel, but there is as good or better around for less. It's not  - in our opinion - a 5 star, and in areas not even a four."
Sep 2015,30,"Some positive and negative elements, average on balance","We stayed in the apartments for a week.  Saw four of them in all with different issues which arose! Kitchen element of apartment was basic - breakfast & lunch, but not dinner (easily anyway).  Which is a shame, because the food on site was poor.We had to move apartments after a couple of days due to ants.  First apartment offered wasn't ideal, so we were shown a second which we accepted to be told that the bathroom fan wasn't working (wasn't in our original one either).  So we moved to a fourth.   Travelling with infant and this all took a few hours and I ended up moving the luggage across the apartments myself.  That evening I asked for an iron and ironing board and I was charged rent on the two items.  I really didn't appreciate the failure to make even that modest gesture.We travelled outside peak season so all the restaurants weren't open, but based on the main restaurant I wouldn't be holding out much hope.Staff were all very friendly.  The estate clean and the beach lovely.  We were happy enough at the price we paid but very unlikely to return."
Sep 2015,30,Not so Grand,"The Hotel reception is very impressive. Thats where it ends.  The  corridoors are carpeted with ugly blue wavy patterned carpet that needs replacing, the rooms need upgrading. We paid for a classic Sea view, to our amazement we were sent to floor -1!!  Not much sea to see from there. We complained and were moved to the third floor next day. Lovely view but room still had carpet that needed replacing.Bathroom also needed to be updated and the floor tiles needed a good clean or replacing especially around the toilet area  Bed was comfortable and bed linen very good.  All in all the Hotel needs to be completley refurbished.  The pool sunbeds were so close together, you could touch the person next to you, very cosy!  The dining room was the same tables very close together.  The food never seemed hot even when the fresh dishes were brought out, very dissapointing.  On a plus side the staff were very friendly and helpful and on my birthday a cake and bottle of bubbly was sent to the room, which was a lovely surprise and very thoughtful.I think this hotel needs to be updated to warrent the 5* it claims to be."
Sep 2015,50,Trip with friends.,"Second visit and as good as ever. Great rooms, helpful staff always make it a pleasure to stay here. Nice beach with water sports available and three pools dotted around the complex too. Only ate breakfast but food quality and variety was good."
Sep 2015,50,All you’d expect and a little more,"Any five star hotel has to be good. And this one doesn’t disappoint in any way. In fact where some can be stuffy this one added relaxed charm to delivering everything just right.We booked one of the self-catering suits. Our upgrade was massive, fully appointed and benefited from great interior design that gave it a holiday feel without being cheap. Our friends who didn’t get the upgrade were equally happy with their suit. By going for the self-catering option we enjoyed the vast high-quality facilities of the hotel while being free to choose where to spend our money on food and drink. And it worked really well."
Sep 2015,50,Brilliant hotel will definitely go back,This is an excellent hotel large airy rooms overlooking sea service was excellent very attentive. Plenty of choice on the buffet breakfast we ate out every night so cannot comment on evening meals hotel had its own private beach which is lovely. The only thing I would say if you want a hotel with lively entertainment this will not be for you as there is not much on.
Sep 2015,50,Ideallic Portuguese break,"Lovely location right on the beach,very welcoming team,,gorgeous beach side restaurants,,very good gym,fabulous terrace bar,,a perfect romantic destination from a well traveled soul,that really looks for quality every time I travel,,"
Sep 2015,50,Lovely,"My holiday was with Travel One, they have many repeat visits to this hotel which I fully understand. I arrived at lunch time along with a several other Travel One guests. A number of us were told that our rooms would not be ready until about 2 p.m. so we decided to go out onto the terrace for lunch and drinks. The terrace opens out from the huge and impressive lobby and lounge area and looks out over the pool terrace and across to the sea. The food was good although a little on the expensive side but I expected to pay five star prices in a five star hotel. The wine was excellent.When my room was ready my luggage was taken there and my case was placed on the rack that was there to hold it. I found that I was on the ground floor, unfortunately overlooking the car park rather than the sea but that wasn't a problem, there were some trees and areas of garden around the car park so it wasn't unpleasant to look at. The outdoor area of my room had a small table and two chairs. The interior was clean, comfortable and nicely decorated, there was a large wardrobe with drawers and a safe inside, there was a large dressing table and bedside cabinets. The bathroom had a bath with efficient shower, there was also a bidet in addition to the usual fittings. The towels and bedding were pure white and were changed regularly. Chocolates (wrapped ones!) were left on the pillows each day. There was a fridge which worked efficiently and I found the wifi connection to be excellent in my room.Our first meal in the dining room was dinner which was taken as part of the half board arrangement. We had been issued at check in with tickets, one could be used each evening for dinner or alternatively could be used for lunch. A number of us used them for lunch one day when we were going into Albufeira old town for dinner. I found the food to be excellent, there were a number of small dishes of prepared starters, many different salad options and soup. For main course there was a good selection, I found the salmon and the pasta dishes to be particularly tasty but I enjoyed everything I had. The desserts were a bit too sweet for me so I usually had fresh fruit. On some evenings there was ice cream available but not every evening.The breakfast buffet was also excellent, as well as cereal, yoghurt etc there were fried, scrambled and boiled eggs, bacon, sausages, beans. There was fresh pink grapefruit cut into slices, sliced oranges, kiwi fruit and melon, these were all lovely and juicy.The service in the dining room was excellent, dirty dishes were removed without you hardly knowing, coffee or tea was brought quickly in the morning and drinks were brought just as quickly in the evening. I must particularly praise Elisabeth  who served us, she was helpful and efficient. The staff were all friendly and polite, they had obviously been trained to five star standards. I found this to be the case with all of the staff throughout the hotel except the one who served the ice cream in the dining room, later in the holiday she was not there and we could serve ourselves with ice cream!The hotel is in a lovely place, the secure gate which is opened with your room card leads down to the beach area, there is a very nice cafe part way down and a beach shop at the bottom of the steps. The sun loungers and umbrellas are not included in your hotel stay, they have to be paid for separately.In the evening there was usually a singer and guitarist on the terrace, it was a bit low key, on one evening the music was a bit livelier and some of us got up to dance but unfortunately those particular musicians were not there again. The only complaint I have about this hotel relates to a couple of evenings when it was too cool to sit outside. There were some children who were aged about four or five years old whose parents allowed them to ride bikes around the lobby and seating area as late as midnight. Not only was this dangerous - they were cycling past the top of a wide, long staircase, also there were elderly and disabled people in the hotel - it was extremely annoying to the guests who wanted to use the area for its proper purpose. One of our group complained to the receptionist who said they would ask Security to speak to the parents. Despite this the same situation occurred again. There were many people in the lounge area who were obviously upset and annoyed at this behaviour being allowed. The waiter just shrugged when we complained to him.  I then complained to the receptionist who said she was unable to do anything as the parents would take no notice if she spoke to them. I then asked to speak to a manager but she said no-one was available, she then phoned Security, I didn't see anyone approach the parents and shortly after that they left. I think it's disgraceful that this sort of behaviour should be allowed to continue. This is a five star hotel, not a playground and some consideration should be given to the other guests. The issue is not about the children being there, there were other children with their parents who were perfectly well behaved. The issue is about the parents allowing this behaviour and the hotel management doing nothing about the situation. This is the only complaint I have about the hotel, other than that I think it is certainly five star standard and I would return.I am a bit mystified about the comment about the poor weather for the wedding, I was there on those dates and the only bad weather was on the 16th when it rained most of the day, the sun shone on all of the other days! Perhaps the wedding was the one that took place on the 16th!"
Sep 2015,50,Brilliant hotel would definitely go back!,"Stayed here from 10-17th Sept, fantastic location for a peaceful break.  Food was excellent and by no means repetitive like one comment.  Staff were extremely helpful and polite and I would definitely recommend to anyone.  Only negative was the noisy neighbours I had on a few nights, I was in apartment 464 so thank you whoever it was that insisted on slamming their door every time they went in and out, and also those who were scraping chairs across the floor for what seemed like hours on end!  This however is not the fault of the hotel but perhaps people should be more considerate of others."
Sep 2015,40,Great hotel only let down by average dining,"Stayed with my wife last week - first impressions excellent with airy reception, very helpful and efficient staff and massive suite with fantastic seaviews. Only slight negative on the room was stained/worn carpet. Positives were generally very friendly and helpful staff, good breakfasts with plenty of choice and excellent beach bar where good quality reasonable snacks available at lunchtime with great views over the beach.Pool area along with all public and private areas in the hotel kept immaculately clean- as we went outside UK school holidays no problems with children and sunbeds at the hotel plentiful.Regular free shuttle into old and new albufeira- useful for something different to do during the day and to eat out in the evening - need to get taxi back but only about 7 Euros.While evening meals not bad def not 5 star and a bit basic and repetitive. Also as the hotel quite isolated disappointing that only very low key brief entertainment on 3 out of 7 days.wine in restaurant reasonable but with captive audience drinks in the bar bit pricey.Overall good hotel with great staff in lovely location - could be great with couple of minor tweaks."
Sep 2015,40,"Great hotel, great location","We continue to stay in the hotel apartments when we visit Portugal on a yearly basis.  This is due to the location, which for us is perfect as we do not like to stay in the rowdy part of town.  The apartments are very clean but have now become a little tired and our bathroom had bits of the marble missing and a chip in the bath.  If you wanted to use the kitchen for self catering purposes, then this place will not suit you as you get no pans or large plates for that matter.  We tended to use it more of a base than for anything else.We used the gym once on our visit, which is very dated and most of the equipment is out of order.We only used the bar once, which is very expensive.  We did not use the restaurants as we preferred to go to the old town for the evenings.All said, we would stay agin as it is very clean and a good location for our requirements."
Sep 2015,40,A very enjoyable stay,"Just back from a lovely stay at this hotel.ROOMS... clean.spacious.we had a suite, sea views.

Sep 2015,30,Disappointing dining,"We were very disappointed in the dining at the hotel and it doesn't warrant a 5 star rating.  Several of the restaurants were closed during our stay, leaving an expensive buffet with a very poor choice of food.  The pool space is limited and you need to pay for beds on the beach.  That said, the hotel is in a great location, beautiful scenery and close to Albuferia."
Sep 2015,50,wedding,"I stayed here with my daughter from 13/9/15 to 17/9/15, for a wedding, excellent place, only downfall was the weather, which was rainy and breezy. But the apartment, beach a pools and staff were excellent. Next time I will stay in July or August. 😊"
Sep 2015,50,Lovely place great week!,Staff is wonderful and the place is beautiful. Perfect for families and couples. Not as ideal for young people travelling in groups. Bedrooms are big enough - the suites outside the main buolding are perfect for families.
Sep 2015,40,what a great place,"Just got back from a week here and what a lovely place, we stayed in the apartments they were clean, spacious, massive beds, pools were all clean plenty of sunbeds,staff all polite and friendly, plenty of breakfast on offer although bacon and sausages were not that good but that is the only fault i found."
Sep 2015,30,Fine place but reservations.,"The hotel makes a good first impression and the location, overlooking a splendid (though crowded) beach is excellent.  The staff are friendly ,approachable and helpful. Our room was fully acceptable, lots of space, cupboard and hanging room and a secluded balcony with a fine view.  We thought the buffet breakfast warm food disappointing but this was hardly surprising given the large numbers requiring feeding.  We did not much care for the buffet dinner either but there are two decent alternatives for lunch and supper on the complex.As veteran travellers- possibly now over-ripe- we were not thrilled to find ourselves surrounded in the public areas and swimming pools by large numbers of children and infants. The hotel complex contains a resort of apartments  which we had not expected to be so numerous and the residents quite properly make full use of the hotel facilities undoubtedly stretching its resources. In summary. we would have loved the hotel when we were still accompanied by our children under 10. It is, of course, no criticism of the hotel which is clearly popular and well regarded.  It just did not suit us."
Sep 2015,50,Best Hoilday and nicest hotel I've ever stayed in ,Me and my partner stayed here in March hotel is out of this world .. Spotless .. Stunning.. And so peaceful Staff r 2nd to none also Would definitley recommend this beautiful hotel You's will not be disappointed Hotel is situated in private grounds It is roughly 15/20 min walk from the strip I can't wait to go back again Definitley my fav hotel I've ever visited
Sep 2015,30,Not 5 star more 3.5,My husband and I have travelled  a lot over the years and stayed in some lovely 5star &4 star . But I have to say this hotel falls short of this compared to other 5 star hotels that we stayed in the algarve .The grounds of the hotel are very nice  & secure and when you enter the hotel to check in it all looks very impressive but all changes when you enter your room..There was stains on the carpet and the room and bathroom where very dated & in need of a refurbishment to bring it up to 5star.A kettle and in room refreshments & a iron &a ironing board is needed.Wi Fi  is poor and hard to get connected at times.The  buffet breakfast was good and staff very attentive to your needs as was all the staff In the hotel.We only ate dinner once in the hotel and it was very good.Lots of variety of places to eat in Santa eulalia which is about ten minutes walk away.My feelings on this hotel is it needs to spend some money on the bedrooms as the rest of the hotel is very nice  and then it can call itself 5 star.
Sep 2015,50,Lovely family holiday,"Visited this lovely hotel on 7th September for 1 week with my husband and 19 month old son. We loved it! We had a 1 bed room apartment which was perfect, lovely rooms and really nice terrace which opened up onto the grass and this led to one of the pools. Every pool has a small children's pool next to it.We just stayed bed and breakfast, the breakfast was amazing! Wish we paid the extra for half board as it's quite limited for other places to eat. We went to Albufeira 3 nights on the free bus and got a taxi home, very easy and lots of restaurants there to choose from.Only downside, check out seems very early, 10am. So we had 6 hours before our pick up with no room.Overall, absolutely great hotel."
Sep 2015,50,Mrs,"This is a superb hotel & spa! The staff are friendly, polite and very helpful! The food is delicious and wonderful choice. The desserts are lip licking!  We had a one bedroom villa which was clean, cosy and comfortable in every way. I will be returning to this hotel in the future!"
Sep 2015,50,Great family holiday,"The facilities were great. We were half board and all meals were to a high standard. Although it was buffet style there were different dishes each day. There was also specific food for their children. The hotel is very children friendly, we have 2 (2 & 8). The pool areas were well laid out and had pools suitable for both children. There is a play area which they both liked. Having the beach close/part of the complex was a good addition. There was a good mix of nationalities too which I think is a good endorsement. I'd recommend to other families. My only criticism was our bed. We were in a 1 bedroom apartment and our beds were v hard. I think someone has commented on this too in earlier reviews."
Sep 2015,40,Overall happy but a few flaws,"Overall, we were happy with the hotel/resort.  The location isn't in the middle of a busy town so some people may feel a a little isolated, but there is a supermarket 2 mins walk to the right of resort, and a much bigger (and much cheaper) one aboout 10 mins walk to the left, which also had bars and restaurants all together.  There is also a very good shuttle service which runs to the new and old town (we only went to the old town) as locals said it was much better and we very much enjoyed the old town, however taxis were only €7 so if you miss the but it isn't a problem.The hotel is very well located on the beach, however there were many steps down to the beach but if you have a push chair or a wheel chair you can go a slightly different way within the hotel to get there which was good.We found the actual hotel to be very clean in the restaurants, reception areas and pool areas, however we did feel our rooms weren't cleaned as well (we were in an apartment)  the floors were mopped but i don't think very well as very often the bottom of our feet turned black and also if you left a used glass on the side of the bed, they didn't move it.  We also came back to our room a few times to find the patio door unlocked and as we were ground floor, our patio area is pretty much shared with our neighbours and anyone from the pool area could easily walk up it.We were half board, so always had breakfast and lunch in the hotel, which were very nice.  The buffet wasn't huge compared to other hotels we have been to but there is definately enough and we had plenty of choice and realy enjoyed it.  The we ate dinner in the hotel twice and again, we really enjoyed the buffet.The staff were very friendly, especially the guy on night duty on reception who was VERY helpful with perfect English.With regards to evening entertainment, they did have a little live music but that was it (maybe between June-Aug they have more) so we found ourselves just having a coffee in the bar before returning to the room with our baby, which was fine for us, but maybe families with younger children who require a mini disco or lively entertainment may need to investigate more if they provide this in the more peak seasons.Our apartment was on the edge of the complex so we did have a little walk to the main hotel which we felt should have been made clearer to us when booking as we may have opted for a different room.  As there was only 1 heated pool in Sept we along with other guests only wanted to use this one so it would get crowded around this pool and if we wanted to go back to the room, it wasn't close - it would be great that even though it wasn't peak season, as there were many guests still in the hotel (we were told the hotel was full) then they should have at least 2 heated pools so guests can spread amongst the two areas.  In the modern day, everyone is obsessed with wifi so i thought i would test it out and it was good in the lounge of the apartment, but very poor in the bedroom.  Around the pool and reception areas was also okay. Overall, this is a very good hotel/resort and if they could just iron out a few flaws it would easily become 'excellent'"
Sep 2015,50,Excellent! Fantastic family holiday ,"This is a late review as we visited in May 2015. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. The location is excellent for a beach holiday, staff are friendly and efficient, hotel is spotlessly clean. We stayed in one of the studios in the grounds rather than the main building. We were self catering but ate breakfast in the hotel once and had room service twice- both were great. We prefer to eat in local restaurants while on holiday and there were plenty to choose from. The fish restaurant on the beach is excellent and we ate there several times. The free shuttle bus to the old town is a nice bonus, but taxis are cheap enough. Lots to do in the local area- we went on a dolphin spotting trip which was fantastic. The beach (which has private access from the hotel) is beautiful. All in all, fab family holiday, we hope to come for a return visit soon :)"
Sep 2015,40,Not what I booked,"If a garden view is what I booked, I would expect from a 5* star to actually get the garden view, although I have been offered an upgrade I cannot confirm this is an upgrade because it's not actually what I wanted, and without actually seeing the garden view room and cannot confirm. I booked and paid for the garden view for a reason,"
Sep 2015,40,Nice resort hotel ,"Business meeting for a week. Requested ocean view but got an apartment out towards the road (not sure what I did wrong). Apartment was spacious and clean and overlooked a pool. But occasional road noise was a continued inconvenience. Also, full kitchen but no coffee provided for first night (nearby market took care of this). Wifi was slow but ok but it had a VoIP filter! So internet phones did not work. Fortunately, Skype got around this.hotel lobby was lovely. Staff were attentive and helpful and we had no unresolved issues. Spa was not very useful (hot pool and sauna) and pricey but workout room was free and has lots of equipment. Beach was beautiful but crowded during the day (public beach is adjacent) - the rock formations are worth exploring. Go early, although we did one lovely walk in evening under a nearly full moon on an empty beach.Hotel restaurants provided quality meals, but ours were part of a business package so your experience may be different. shuttle runs into town is convenient and reliable. The old town is a 6 km hop. however, Outside restaurants are in easy walking distance (10 minutes). Just keep in mind Albufeira is Portugals largest tourist destination, so there are lots of tourist traps and overpriced selections. Hotel recommendations were very good. A couple were high priced but quality another was reasonable, authentic and good. However, meals in Portugal should be priced reasonably ( you can eat very well for 25 euros with wine), so you be the judge."
Sep 2015,40,Bad location but beautiful hotel,"Can't fault the beauty of the hotel. Gorgeous lobby. Beach nearby so views were lovely. Large, plentiful pools. Rooms lovely (though beds were not the most comfortable). Food at hotel was quite poor. Main negative was that there were no good shops/restaurants nearby. Quite a walk to get to them."
Sep 2015,50,Great for families and couples alike,"We stayed in room 342 not a sea view room however still had nice balcony and views. Very clean and trust me I'm fussy although some marks on the furniture and floor but this is to be expected it is a very popular hotel. Food fantastic, put on 5 pounds great selection of drinks not badly priced in view of its 5 star status. Great position being high up the views are breath taking. Free shuttle bus to old/new albufeira worth a visit. If you want to eat out short walk to Martins Restaurant great choice, great food or if you feel like stretching your legs to build up an appetite turn right at the entrance and you have a variety of cuisines to choose from. Saving the best till last The Spa definitely worth a visit, staff are very professional. The pool bar staff could not do enough for us always smiling and having a banter. On that note ALL the staff were friendly and helpful, even the maintainance man was polite when my aunt couldn't open her safe, he was there very quickly. Would probably agree that it's not 5 stars but would say it's a good 4.5, will definitely be returning."
Sep 2015,40,Some 5* elements.,"Have just returned from this hotel/apartments. We (two adults and two children 4 and 2yrs) went for ten days at the end of August. The hotel lobby and restaurants are definatley 5*. The waiting staff are top notch, the buffet food and selection is lovely. 4 euros for a bottle of water with dinner so we had wine etc from the supermarket and just had water with dinner. The Apartment is a bit dated, but spotlessly clean. The shower curtain was threadbare and we found the furnishings a bit poor, the bed was solid. The terrace we didn't use as it wasn't enclosed and the children could fall down the stairs, also our apartment faced the main road so we could hear cars all night. We didn't leave our children at the kids club as the children seemed to come and go as they pleased and ours wondered out of gate, luckily we stayed with them so grabbed them! Also, priority seemed to be given to Portuguese children, and the evening entertainment was very low key. We didn't mind this as we couldn't have late nights with the children, we did visit the old town one night where we saw lots of entertainment. The hotel provide a free shuttle bus and a taxi is only 7 euros if you miss a bus. The only other gripe was we were given no assistance getting our bags onto the transfere coach. The receptions staff just watched on, in our opinion that isn't a five star service. But the restaurant and the hotel lobby and bar are definatly 5 star service!  And the bubbly and chocolates on arrival to celebrate our honeymoon was a lovely gesture. Overall a great holiday, great pools, great food just some little points that I feel the hotel should touch up on. We would return for sure,  but would stay In a two bedroomed apartment nearer the main hotel area."
Sep 2015,40,"Very nice stay, but not 5 star.","Just back from a two night stay. Very nice resort and very central. Walking distance from Eulalia, with lots of restaurants, bars. Very nice walk into strip and only cost us €6 to get a taxi to the old town. Breakfast was nice and staff very efficient, helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay there again if I was visiting Albufeira. gym is in need of upgrade. Plenty of parking."
Sep 2015,50,Family Resort that ticks all the boxes!,"Firstly from start to finish we were very impress with the Grande Real Santa Resort and as a family of 4 (children of 3 & 5) it catered for our needs. Having read through many of the reviews, which I'm sure many points are justified, after a weeks stay at the end of August, I hope this review is helpful:Arrival - we were greeted very warmly by the informative front desk, who told us everything we needed to know. Our bags were then loaded on to a resort buggy and dropped of to our one bedroom apartment.One bed apartment - slightly dated but not offensive and for the amount of time we stayed with in it and not by the pool, beach or elsewhere it match our criteria which is clean, spacious enough and well equipped. I notice a few remarks about the wi fi which personally I couldn't care if the room had it or not, it was good enough to load web pages and download an album from I tunes.Food - we went full board (breakfast, lunch and dinner excluding drinks). We found this to be good value and for the price we paid it meant that even if we did decide to go out for a meal or two we would probably would have saved money than eating out for lunch and dinner. The food itself was good quality and the range was vast for a buffet, plenty to choose from. Personally for us who had young children it worked perfectly as we didn't have to stress if there was something suitable for them as there was so much to choose from and quantity/waste they eat or left. We have all been there when we have paid for a full meal and the kids refuse to eat it or didn't like it, that stress simply wasn't there for us!Prices - Again we found the cost of drinks and hotel good value however we didn't have to pay for a meal so I'm not sure of the value there. Cocktails were €6, a large larger €4.5 and soft drinks around €2-3, same with ice cream. From previous experience I've paid a lot more for drinks at hotels, pints up to £6 so I though it was good value. The hotel itself offers a free kids club between 10am - 10pm and start times are flexible so kids can be dropped at anytime, evening entertainment, beach towels, sports facilities and much more.Is it a 5 start hotel - compared to a city hotel, definitely not and probably not to others 5 stars in upmarket places however at worst it is a 4 start. For us with small children, maybe not quite being the most uapmarket 5 star made us a little more relaxed with the children as there are so many other families there.Overall the pool areas were very clean, pool/bar staff was very helpful, access to the beach is close and easy and access in and out of the resort is secure adding that piece of mind. There were things that I though could have been done better or required better attention but maybe that's a culture difference or just me being uptight!!!This is a excellent resort for families, children and couples and we had a great week there and will definitely be heading back."
Sep 2015,50,Nice relaxing hoilday,"The hotel was a lovely place for a holiday, the place is big and the staff very helpful, maids clean everyday.the pool areas are supported by a snack bar and close to the apartments if a little expensive compared to eating and drinking out in the town.we were a family with kids 11 & 10, there was a family day each Saturday with bouncy castle and games adn activities each day in the kids club ( although they didn't go to any) we would go back but it would probably be without them and take advantage of the spa and gym"
Aug 2015,40,4.5 stars - Excellent holiday,"We stayed here for one week in August 2015, and had a wonderful family holiday.  (Bed and breakfast)We had a private car transfer from the airport, which we booked through Sovereign Travel.  The transfer is about 30-40 minutes. The hotel reception staff all spoke English perfectly – and I overheard many other languages spoken too.  They were very helpful and courteous.  We booked a one-bedroom sea-view suite, and requested the top floor to make the most of the view.  With two small children, we were concerned about how the room set-up would be.  We were pleasantly surprised that there are two rooms off the hallway entrance.  One room is the lounge, but we had it constantly set up as a bedroom with the sofa-bed all set up for our two children.  The other room has a huge double bed in it (6 foot), which was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!  Both rooms have an en-suite bathroom, AC, mini fridge, TV, and balcony.  It was like having a two-bedroom suite, so it suited our family of 4 perfectly.  We liked that we could put the children to bed, close their door and we could stay up and watch telly or sit on the balcony, rather than feeling we all had to go to bed at the same time. We had a bottle of water in each room on arrival as well as two tubes of Portuguese Smarties ☺We had already read on TA that there was a fridge so we brought a travel kettle, two mugs and teabags with us so we could make tea and coffee in our room.  (There is a shop to buy milk about a 5-minute walk, as you turn right out of the complex).  We also connected our portable DVD player to the TV so the children could watch Peppa Pig etc when we were having some downtime in the room.There are three pools (but I think two further pools for the apartments to use).  There are two larger pools – one heated and one apparently heated, but I am not sure it was… it was rather chilly, but once you got used to it, it was OK.  The heated pool was the most popular of course, and I can imagine if you are there without children, it would have been annoying to swim or relax there during August when it is busy with children.  Our 5-year-old son practically lived in that pool all week. There is a toddler pool too, which was about 35cm deep, perfect for the little ones.  They all shared (most of the time!) their toys such as watering cans, buckets, Lego and other tubs to pour water in and out of.  Our two year old spent most of her time in this pool, so both children were happy!It is only a few minutes walk down to the beach from the hotel, where we spent one morning.  Paid 10 euro for two sun loungers and an umbrella… it was very busy with locals and tourists but the water was freezing (it is the Atlantic Ocean, after all!).  The breakfast selection was very good; I am not sure why other reviews on here say it was terrible…. There were about 5 or 6 different types of pastries to choose from, pancakes, fruit, yoghurts, eggs, sausages, bacon, cereals, cheeses, juices etc.  It gets very busy after about 9.15am, which we learnt on the first day, so we just made sure we were there 8.30am each morning and it wasn’t so busy.  We sat outside in the glorious warm weather; it was a lovely way to start the day.  The breakfast staff were very attentive and helpful and spoke several languages too.We went to Zoo Marine one day, which is about 20 minutes away, and broke up the week nicely. It has a water park, theme park and aquarium.  We watched an amazing dolphin show and is well worth a visit.About a mile away is the new town; it had a larger supermarket and a lot of restaurants and bars.  It looked quite tacky, but fun if you were there without children!  We caught the free bus to the old town one evening, it was lively with lots of locals and tourists and had dinner and a wonder around.  I think we were lucky, as I have read about long taxi queues, but we didn’t have to queue at all to get back to the hotel, there were loads of taxis waiting. (8 euro to get back)Within the hotel complex there are several restaurants to choose from including down by the beach, and there is a great pizza restaurant just outside the hotel complex (turn left).There is a Kids Club, which looked like it had loads of activities, but we didn’t use it as our son just wanted to be in the pool all day!  There was a disco, but it was always at the time we were having dinner, which was a shame.The only three suggestions we would like to make to the hotel is:1/ Improve the WIFI.  We know that it is not their primary concern, but if you offer it, please make it usable.  At check in we were told which WIFI to connect to, but it was still pretty awful most of the time.  2/ The security on the room doors could be improved.  There is a lock, but it is at the same height as the handle (i.e. easily opened by little toddlers).  It could have done with an additional lock towards the top of the door so little hands can’t reach it.  At night I was terrified of one of my two waking up and just opening the door and wondering out into the corridor.  It could have happened and, sleeping in the other room, we would have no way of knowing they had left the room. Thankfully, this did not happen, but a lock higher up would have meant I slept a lot better than waking up every couple of hours to check they were still in bed! 3/ The children’s play area could do with having a canopy over it.  It is a suntrap where it is located, no shade, so the metal climbing frame is burning hot.  The whole area would be used so much more if it was protected from the sun, as it was I barely saw any children using it, as it was just too hot!Lastly, on our last day we didn’t have to leave for the airport until mid afternoon, but we had to check out by midday.  The hotel allows guests to still use the facilities and then use the Spa downstairs to shower and change before leaving.  This worked perfectly, and didn’t feel like we had to shower and be ready 4 hours before we were leaving for airport.We loved our holiday at this hotel and are seriously considering a return visit next summer."
Aug 2015,40,Not 5 star but generally very pleasant,"I'll try to make this useful and realistic.  Spacious, modern hotel, kept very clean everywhere, helpful reception staff, nice rooms, lovely situation with path down to public beach (which is good sand, kept clean, surveillance for swimming, lots of loungers and parasols to hire, fun water sports available).Some frustrating aspects: painfully slow (free) wifi, limited and boring pool space for such a large hotel (2 circular pools, one heated - hot, one ambient), very good breakfast buffet but usually 10+mns queuing to get a table - not very 5 star.  Of the various restaurants at the hotel, the evening buffet was good, but expensive (35€ without drinks) - we spent less in the 2 à la carte restaurants!  The à la carte in the main building, and the fish-oriented one halfway down to the beach were both very good, and much more classy than a noisy buffet.  During the day, food at the pool bar, and at the brasserie-type restaurant (also halfway to the beach), was very basic.  Drinks and icecreams at the pool bar were very reasonably priced.As far as entertainment was concerned, each evening there was some live music in the bar and at the brasserie restaurant.  Ok, but not extraordinary and no dancing.  There is a nightclub/disco on site, but only on Fridays and Saturdays I think and open from midnight only!  We didn't go, so can't judge it.For teenage kids, really nothing particular to do either during the day or in the evenings.If you want to wander outside the hotel, there are quite a few restaurants, bars and a supermarket about 15mns walk up the road.  Also there is a hotel shuttle to and from central Albufeira - but not in the evenings, when you need to get a taxi back to the hotel.  Very cheap (around 6€) but horrendous queues for taxis at Albufeira (we waited more than an hour on one occasion).Overall, pleasant stay.  Fairly expensive hotel, but good standard and (let's be a bit snobby) I think the cost of the place and the lack of nightlife have the positive effect of avoiding a certain unpleasant type of client.  General behaviour was good."
Aug 2015,40,Enjoyable!,"Stayed in a one room apartment for a week. The apartment had a outdoor patio with two chairs and table and was in a green and quit part . Very well equiped , with micro oven, coffea maker, toaster , well functioned AC , big flat screet TV in two rooms, very comfy bed, nice bathroom with clasic bath products from Porto. Cleaning was exelent. The interior was a bit dated, but everything functioned well. Only one minor detail, the pillows where not comfy. The WiFi was also a bit unstable. The rest of the resort was tastefully done , and all the personell was friendly and helpfull. Good selection of food in the morning and in the evening buffet - free sparkeling wine (Cava-type) in the morning Splendid view from the terrace.The bus to old or new town was free, and on time. Just be there 5 minutes before.Nice to take a swim in the pool in the morning, it was empty! The two pools belonging to the flats are much more calm than the main pool on the terrace.  There were a lot of portuguese families in August, but well behaved kids and no problem. It is not far to walk to the nearest Minimarked , just outside to the right (in the Alfama complex has a well stocked Minimarked) and only 10-15 minutes to the beginning of the ""Strip"" if you take a left out of the complex. Tried the Spa and had a Vicy shower massage (back massage) - very good! All in all a very relexing resort with a lot of space and green areas, but not like a 5 star hotell in Northern Europe - expect a Family resort 4+ * I would say"
Aug 2015,40,"Family holiday with friends: not 5 star, but definitely met expectations ","We spent 6 days and nights at this hotel for our summer holiday with our two boys: aged 4 and 1 and also our friends who have a 5 year old boy. I agree with other reviews that this hotel is not 5 star. There are parts of the hotel that need redecorating and small things like having a shower curtain with the bath/shower make it more like 3 star than 5. Despite this, it was everything we expected, wanted and needed. The buffet on an evening was actually quite good. Kids are for free; we went b&b. I've read some reviews that don't rate the evening buffet, but we felt it was really good. We visited zoo marine one day and the old town one night. If you go to the old town, we highly recommend Shalom 2 who have the best ribs we've ever tasted! The boys absolutely had a ball. It's very close to the beach, which is a lovely beach with handy caves to get shade for free if you have young kids! The fish restaurant and cafe bar as a part of the hotel, but on the beach front are good places to eat. We found the fish restaurant overpriced though. We were very happy with our room and the cleaning service. Our boys had their own room linked to ours by a hall so it was just a perfect set up for us. They had their own bathroom too. We booked a family suite with resort view, but ended up with a sea view which was a real bonus.The coach transfer through jet2 was longer than advertised and this frustrated us. Taxis are inexpensive and the bus service running until 7ish at night to new and old town is useful. Lastly, do not order a hot dog from the pool bar. It arrived cold and I mean cold with a topping of grated carrot and crisp shavings: pretty much the oddest thing we have ever eaten! On the flip side the cocktails at the bar terrace near reception were fantastic and we got to see Louis Figo at the bar, Portuguese Real Madrid ex captain. Apparently a regular!"
Aug 2015,50,Great 5 stars resort and a hidden gem,"I was there in August 2015. Coming early to the hotel, expecting to wait to be checked in, but the staff were very helpful and friendly, and made their best to provide the room as early as possible. Resort facilities are great, it is a huge resort with a great view. Beaches, indoor and outdoor pools, restaurants and gardens are all provided and well maintained. I have booked a double room but instead get a big apartment as a complementary upgrade. The apartment consists of a living room with full kitchenette, entrance, balcony, bathroom and a big bedroom. I do recommend this hotel for families as well as for couples."
Aug 2015,20,Excessively small room and overpriced venue,The room is very small and we can see some stains on the floor carpet. We can also see wear signs on the furniture.No wifi pass was transmitted on check in.Only positive comment is location near the beach.
Aug 2015,30,Not 5 star !!!,"I stayed here for a week in August with my husband it wasn't cheap either but it is very dated carpets & decor are from the 80s great location and facilities but staff too relaxed not helpful we ordered a sandwich for lunch the waitress just put food in front of us never asked if we wanted salt & pepper then disappeared you have to chase them all the time. Breakfast is a nightmare you have to queue I don't mind kids but too many running round and people pushing push chairs around  buffet area it's not a relaxed atmosphere at all. In a 5 star you should get better service then this could go on more but won't I would rate it 3 star and I won't be staying here again the staff need to be a lot more attentive  and on the ball, it is a shame as this let's it down. One more thing you have to pay €10 a day for a sun bed on the beach !!! We have stayed in 5 star several times and do'snt compare."
Aug 2015,40,Nice hotel but not suitable for couples when we went in August,"Stayed for a week in August at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia. Overall had an enjoyable holiday. Hotel of good quality rooms clean. We had a room overlooking the resort which we found to be better than paying for a sea view as the sun is on that side of the hotel late afternoon so nice to sit out on the balcony when you go to your room.The hotel is a bit remote for our liking nothing around it a bit of a walk to the new town which we found to be a bit tacky and run down. Old town a bit better but seems to have gone down hill a bit since we were there last . Long taxi queues to get back to hotel. Went to Vilamura for the day, lovely Marina better quality śhops and bars but a bit far to go every night. Waiters and staff very friendly and helpful I would not recommend this hotel for couples as it seems to attract lots of families  - quite noisy. No children free areas. Dissapointed that we were not able to use indoor pool without having to pay extra. It would be nice to have smoke free outside areas for dining and poolside as this became quite a problem for us as most smokers have no regard for others. Wi-fi was very poor."
Aug 2015,30,A nice Getaway however certainly not cheap!,"Has everything one would expect from a 5* hotel besides the poor wi-fi. Breakfast was lovely and with a generous selection of foods. Wi-fi was disappointingly poor! We were in room 236 and the wi-fi was not good enough. So much so that the Messenger app for Facebook actually failed to work properly during our stay at the hotel. The rooms themselves were nice with cleaners coming on a daily basis. Impressed with the selection of restaurants within the hotel premises. Our favourite was the one beside the beach which also has some wonderful ice cream. Each restaurant area has live music from 8-11 which is of very high quality. The hotel offers a shuttle bus service into both the New Town and the Old Town 6 times per day finishing around 8 (I would recommend the Old Town.) Taxi's back from the old town are cheap, no more than 7 euros but beware that there can be a very long queue (up to 1 hour) before getting your taxi due to the high demand at night time. 3 main swimming pools were disappointing, they are circular shaped and not really made for swimmers, more for children and families. Worth noting that it is a very short walk down to the beach (3mins) with lovely views."
Aug 2015,30,Disappointed,"SummaryI stayed in this hotel with my wife the first week in August 2015 on a B&B basis having booked a deluxe sea view room. We chose it because of the Tripadvisor rating and its close proximity to the beach. Overall, we were disappointed mainly due to the small pool, limited range of food and the hotel’s isolated location from shops and restaurants and no drinking water left in the room or coffee making facilities in the room. The WIFI was very poor. I would have given it a four star rating overall but tripadvisor shows this as very good but I think its closer to average/good than very good.LocationThe hotel is isolated from shops and restaurants although if you take a left from the hotel you can walk to Albufeira Strip in 20 to 30 minutes. However, the hotel provides a free 27 seated courtesy bus which runs every hour (early morning to early evening). Get there 10 minutes earlier as it does get busy and some people get left. If you take a right from the hotel there is small supermarket under an apartment block about 10 minutes walk on the left. You can buy some nibbles and drinks for your mini-bar.RoomThe sea view room was excellent with a balcony which had a superb view of the beach and sea. It was kept clean and the air-con worked fine. Like many hotels it can be noisy in the early hours of the night as music is played from other hotels/restaurants nearby. We take good quality earplugs so we were not really affected by it. I also found the bed to be a little too hard for comfort.PoolThe pool was small and uninviting so we went to the beach although I it would be fine for small kids. Beach and SeaYou access the public beach by crossing a small service road at the back of the hotel and have to use your room card to open the gate. You have to pass by a small bar and go down some steps to the beach. It’s about 5 minutes walk. The hotel provides beach towels which you collect near the hotel reception.You have to pay €15 a day for 2 people for two sun loungers, mattresses and an umbrella, although you can hire an umbrella for €5 to put in the sand yourself. This can prove expensive if you decide to go to the beach every day and since the pool is uninviting that’s what we did. Although from 2pm onwards it only costs €10. They are positioned quite close to each other so when other holidaymakers smoke which they did on regular basis it can be uncomfortable if you don’t smoke. The sea was very cold and so much so I did not go in. My brave wife did but only a couple of times. It was very busy and on one day we were unable to get sun loungers. The sand is fine and a nice beach.MiniBarThere is a mini bar in the room which is empty and as such I filled it with drinks I bought from the nearby supermarket. I was not charged extra for using it. ServiceThe staff were very helpful, professional and polite. We used room service on a couple of occasions in the evening and the quality was good. No complaints. I was disappointed that no water was left in the room – this is little money for the hotel and leaves you dissatisfied.BreakfastYou have to get down to breakfast before 9.15am if you don’t want to queue. On one day we had to wait 20 minutes on our first day which we avoided by going early on other days. We did see a queue every day. The food quality was good although compared to other 5 star hotels I have stayed in I would say the range was limited. For example, I like bananas with cereal and never saw one during my stay.Buffet lunchYou can pay for a buffet lunch for €29 and eat all you want – but we only did this once on the first day we arrived. Again, the food range was limited and I don’t think it was value for money although the quality was good. You’re better off having a small bite at the local bar next to the beach if you can get in as it’s very busy with guests and other public using the beach.Evening MealYou can pay for an evening buffet meal for €35 but again the range was very limited and I was very disappointed. We went late about 8.30pm but there were not many guests there and it had the feel of a cafe as opposed to a restaurant. We did eat out on other days at a restaurant next to the beach bar which was much better in choice and quality and value for money."
Aug 2015,50,"Fabulous Hotel,Fabulous Holiday!","Just arrived back from a Luxury week away with my partner,staying at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa.The staff where very welcoming and helpful.Check in was quick and easy,with the hotel being fully booked and as we arrived around 10am and checkout wasn't until 12 we where told their would be a short wait for our room. The staff kindly carried our bags to the luggage room and offered us beach towels and access to the spa while we wait. The wait was around an hour which was quicker than expected and we where kindly shown to our room.The room was excellent and spotless,which was cleaned once a day. The maids where helpful within changing the two single beds into a huge double. The bathroom had complementary shampoos and shower gels,also a fresh bottle of water. The room also included a hairdryer, TV with a wide range of channels and a fridge. Breakfast was excellent and service was great,small que as you have to wait to be seated but is very quick as staff work quickly to clear and remake tables inside and out. Food was always freshly cooked,with a wide selection of hot and cold food. Staff kindly offered a selection of hot drinks tea/coffee as seated. The poolside bar also offered a large selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks and a small selection of food. Staff where always friendly and helpful. They also offer a small selection of sandwiches which where cooked freshly by a chef in front of you. I would highly recommend the Pork Steak Roll as it was always delicious.The hotel itself has 3 main swimming pools,overlooking the beach front which me and my partner used throughout our time here.  The 3 pools varied in depth and temperature. The children's pool was the warmest of all 3 but was for small children. The deepest pool was cold but was great for a quick dip after sitting in the sun all day. The most popular pool was warm and was the perfect depth.Sunbeds get snapped up very quickly but the hotel uses a rule of after 30minutes of not being used they can then be taken. Which worked well as it gave everybody the opportunity to use them.Every evening me and my partner ventured out into the town for dinner,which included the new town and the old.The new town,was in walking distance from the Hotel around 10-15minutes,with a few shops on the walk up. In a taxi this was only costing €4/5 euro. The new town is a strip made up of clubs,shops,bars and restaurants,which was a great night out,wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a quite relaxing evening but is great if you want to have fun.The old town was a little further out,which we didn't attempt to walk as it was costing €7/8 euro in a taxi. The old town had many more restaurants and was more relaxing than the strip. The old town is built up on the beach front with many beautiful restaurants.Lots of shops and bars. Only problem we found was catching a taxi home as you had to wait in a Que for around 30minutes.Overall me and my partner are looking forward to returning next year as the hotel lived up to its expectations,and the staff went above and beyond to make you feel welcome. Only thing I would fault is that the wifi is very slow throughout the day,as many guests were using it,but overall I would defiantly recommend this hotel to anyone.Perfect hotel,perfect holiday!"
Aug 2015,30,"Great location, though better for families and over priced for what it offers","My partner and I stayed there thinking that it would be a great place for a relaxing stay in the Algarve. Unfortunately it is very much a family resort and the pool area is small for such a large resort, therefore there is not much ""peace and quiet"" around the pool.The location is great for the beach (though the beach is busy, it is always very quiet in the no umbrella sections and so easy to find a nice piece of sand to set yourself up for the day).The rooms are large and the ones with the balconies over looking the beach have a great view. The décor is a bit naff, but nothing terrible.Perhaps the biggest draw back for such an expensive hotel is the lack of quality food. The breakfast is not great and the restaurant options are very limited (though there is a higher quality restaurant that opens Wed-Sun, unfortunately we only stayed there last Sunday to early Wednesday).The wifi is also terrible. With so many guests, it cant cope with the traffic. Worked perfectly when we were leaving early for a 6.30 am flight."
Aug 2015,40,"Nice Hotel, Not 5 Star Though","We stayed here for 10 days in August with our 3 year old and had a nice break.In general I'd say this is a good quality hotel but is overrated at 5 stars. By UK standards I would say it's a 4 star maximum.Guests were mainly Portuguese I would say, maybe 50-60pc. The rest UK, other European, US etc.We stayed in one of the one-bedroom apartments which was very good. The standard of the decor and cleanliness was high and there is a decent amount of space. The apartments face either onto the shared play areas or the hotel itself. All either have a shared patio (ground floor) or a balcony on the first floor. I think if you have kids the ground floor is the better option if you can. All have air con which worked well (if a little noisy). Minor issues - sometimes we would get noise from upstairs apartment occasionally when they moved chairs (often!). Also the door security is not childproof - it locks fine but the lock is unlocked when the handle is pulled down, so you'll have to keep an eye on younger children.The service was generally _ok_ but we did get some poor/aloof/surly service that I would not expect at a hotel that describes itself as 5 star. The young guy handing out towels in reception was particularly weird as he stared through you and said the bare minimum of words (and no courtesy). On a positive note our maid was excellent and very friendly, also the bar and food staff near the pool. Also the kids club staff too.We were half board and had a buffet breakfast and dinner each day. I can be a bit of a foodie at times and didn't have much expectation of the buffets but I must say they were fine. Breakfast was the same each day but still very good. Too much choice to name. And again in the evening the choice and quality was good and didn't get repetitive since the options were regularly changed. Suffice to say we either had a very light lunch or non at all :) I would advise getting to breakfast early in the sitting (8 onwards) or you'll be faced with a queue to be seated and a scrum at the buffet.We also had family with us so the kids (3yo, 5yo, 7yo) went to a kids club a couple of times a day for an hour or so and they enjoyed it. They basically have the run of a conference suite in the hotel that doubles as kids club - so there's a main room and then 3 or 4 other good size rooms to play in with the toys, sports equipment etc they provide. Staff were all young people but looked after the children ok it seemed. Children are signed in and out at a reception desk but I think (as a paranoid parent) I would have liked slightly stiffer security measures. Also, in the evening we saw a couple of shows (reptiles and parrots) which the kids enjoyed a lot. I think these are operated by external people who make money by taking photos of you and the kids with the animals and then try and sell them to you. All optional of course.The pool areas were very good. The hotel and the two apartment areas each have two pools, a toddler pool 30cm deep and a main pool. The hotel toddler pool is heated but the outer pools aren't (or at least not much - 23C).The beach is nice and easily accessible from the hotel. It's not private so does get used by other tourists and is busier at weekends. Sun loungers are 15E a day I believe.The area around the hotel is built up with houses and apartment blocks but doesn't have much to do (a couple of restaurants and small supermarkets) - other things to do are a 20 min walk away I would say. I'd say the hotel is suited to people who looking to spend most of their time at the resort, including mealtimes (either catered or self-catering).We didn't take any spa treatments but did use the gym, which was small but fine.All in all I think this is nice hotel but I would echo what many of the other reviewers are saying - it's over billed and if you have expectations of 5 star luxury you might be disappointed. Instead I'd call it a good-quality family hotel."
Aug 2015,40,Excellent Family holiday,"Stayed in apartment 580 which was a one bedroom apartment. We are 2 adults and 1 five year old child. Room had one large bed and sofa bed. Also fully equipped kitchenette, fridge, hob, microwave, toaster etc. we stayed half board so did not fully utilise the kitchenette. Apartment was nice and was cleaned every day had no problem with it. The hotel has three pool areas each with 2 pools one a kids pool and the other a deeper pool. We only used the pool by our apartment and was always able to get sun loungers. There was a pool bar here as there is at all the pool areas. Relatively expensive for instance 3.5 euros for apple juice and 4.5 euros for large beer. With regards to eating we enjoyed breakfast was always good and nice selection of fruit, pastries and hot food. With a young child we tended to go to breakfast quite early, we did notice that later (9.30 onwards) it tended to get busier. The lunchtime buffet was also excellent particularly enjoyed grilled fish and desserts. My daughter really liked grilled chicken. The evening buffet we did not enjoy as a family. Even though there was a kids buffet my daughter could not find anything that she liked. Would have been nice if something simple like pasta with tomato sauce was available just as a fall back. We had vouchers for half board that could be used for either lunch or dinner, so we used for lunch when we could. We tried Atlantico snack bar on way to beach and this was good and cheaper than other hotel options. The Santa Eulalia restaurant overlooking the beach we also tried. This was really good and fish dished my wife and I had were great. However on the kids menu the only fish available was fish fingers from freezer! Would of been nice that a great fish restaurant could provide fresh fish dishes for kids. She ended up having fresh grilled chicken which she really liked.The kids club at hotel is really good. Is available from 10 till 10. If you wish you can leave yours kids here, there is a wide range of activities from arts and crafts, to swimming lessons and shows. Would highly recommend, we went with our daughter when she was at club and were very impressed with the staff.For the beach you can rent sun loungers and parasol (10 euros till 2 or 15 euro for day for 2 loungers and brolly). It's a public beach so if you don't want sun loungers you can just put towels down on beach and is free.The only downside of resort is that there is not much very close by. There's a little supermarket if you go right out of resort gates (it's in the resort next door). Martins restaurant is left out of the gates and is nice and reasonable. The hotel has shuttle box to albuferia which we used and is worth taking advantage off.Had a really good time here. Wish regards to prices yes drinks etc are more than other places in albuferia but it's a lovely location. It's a bit out of the way but wasn't a problem for us."
Aug 2015,40,very good but room for improvement,"Just returned from 9 night stay in Seaview Suite, B&B with husband and 9 year old.Room was excellent - Via 1 entrance from the hallway you enter 2 rooms which are connected, each with separate bathrooms. Main bedroom has huge bed, second room with pullout bed for children. Cleaned daily with fridge in each room. No iron.Breakfast was good - Always a queue as you are seated by staff but it goes quickly. Staff work relentlessly hard to clear and reset tables and replenish food/drinks.  Range of choice is large and the usual for good hotel.Poolside - There are lots of small pools which is a shame as it limits what you can do in them. Only 1 pool is heated and can get very crowded on cooler days.  Plenty of sunbeds around and parasols.  Fresh towels available daily. No daytime activities actively promoted or visible beyond a board by the breakfast room.Lunch - limited choice on site. We ate at poolside bar (very limited choice) and Club Atlantico (good choice but dreadfully poor service - they need more staff).Dinner - we didn't eat in the hotel but can recommend the Santa Eualia fish restaurant next to Club Atlantico.Free shuttle bus - queue early to avoid missing a seat as only 27 allowed on board. Last bus back from Old Town is circa 8pm.  Taxis are cheap but there can be long queues in the Old Town.Gym - disappointing for a 5* hotel.WIFI - free but at times intermittentEvening entertainment - pleasant, easy listening singer each night but nothing notable.Probably wouldn't return only because there are other, better places to try out."
Aug 2015,50,Peace and tranquillity,"After reading some of the reviews to this hotel after I booked I was apprehensive,  but from the moment we pulled up to the front doors, and from the whispers of the other coach passengers ""wow look at that hotel 5stars"". Any doubts we had were gone. Very helpful and welcoming staff, our cases were taken from the coach and carried up to our apartment. The apartment was excellent also,  spotless and cleaned every day, they even did the dishes. The bathroom had shower gel and shampoos etc there was also a free bottle of fresh water waiting on your table. The hotel was exactly what I wanted a place to relax and chill out. Towels were supplied for sunbathing and going to the beach. A walk along the beach was relaxing and there was plenty off room if you wanted to catch a few rays.  The views from the hotel were spectacular. I would definitely recommend this hotel a little more expensive but you get what you pay for."
Aug 2015,20,Reduce Your Expectations (to Zero),"Don't get me wrong. This is an upscale hotel in a perfectly lovely setting. People come here from all over everywhere. However, as a five-star hotel this place falls so far short of expectation that I recommend looking elsewhere. It's okay, really, once you reduce your expectation of the service level to zero. Let me approximate the reality of this place: you get nothing, and nobody cares. Examples: arrive after the morning rush, but before check-in time, and nobody will help you to get a lounge chair at the pool. Since people lay towels on the lounges, then leave for hours (as people do all over the world), we needed help to figure out how to find two lounges, and to move them together. No such luck. Reception forgot to call us when our room was ready, then forgot to have our luggage brought to the room. Turn down service on night #1, but not on nights #2 or #3. In three days at the pool and beach not one person came to ask if we wanted anything. I still don't know how to get a drink of water out there. One bottle of water provided in the room, after which you must fend for yourself to get another one. Nobody tells you that the lounge chairs on the beach are provided by a separate company, and cost 15 Euros per day for two chairs and an umbrella. You have to find out the hard way. The hallway outside our room smelled like cleaning fluid when we arrived, and smelled like cleaning fluid when we left.It's a small matter, but they really could do something for couples. There are two main pools, with children doing what children do in both. Is it out of the question to reserve one pool for adults only?Here's what I recommend. If you've spent time in Porto and in Lisbon, and you have a few days left before having to be home in the USA, if there isn't a better hotel around here than this one, fly back to Miami instead, and stay at The Breakers on Palm Beach, where the terms ""five star"" and ""service"" go together without the word ""no"" in the middle."
Aug 2015,50,Wedding,I got married here in June 2015.What can I say breath taking views and unreal venue.First impression are mouth opened.Food is unreal and fresh. Staff are very professional and trained to a 5 star service.We had 100 guests and the whole day went off without a problem recommend for weddings or a resort.
Aug 2015,50,Excellent Hotel & Location,"We stayed in May and we had our best holiday yet. We were a family of 4, children aged 5 & 10. The staff were friendly and we felt very welcome. Facilities were great, right by the beach. We went self catering so we could eat out but feel we should have probably opted for the B&B. We ate in the restaurant once but it was quite expensive being a 5 star hotel so not ideal when you're trying to budget for all meals out. The food was lovely though as you would expect. They do a shuttle bus a few times a day to the old and new town which we used most days and was a great service and saved us on taxi's (which were inexpensive anyway). The only thing about the bus service was dare I say it 'the germans'! Sorry but they are unable to observe any kind of queuing system and think that it's ok to push in when everyone else has been waiting and arrived before them. This was quite frustrating and I know other holiday makers felt the same so perhaps the hotel should put some sort of notice up to say first come first served where the bus stop is.Apart from that we had the best holiday, weather was great, people, pools and apartment amazing. Our beds were changed and the apartment was cleaned from top to bottom everyday. I am looking froward to returning in the next couple of years and would highly recommend it for couples and families alike."
Aug 2015,40,Great family hotel,It is our 2nd year in this hotel with the kids and it is very good.. separate pools dispite the location of the room/apartment and super friendly staff makes this fully booked hotel not so full after all.
Aug 2015,40,"Nice, but NOT 5*.","Nice pomace but my main concern is that the restaurant suddenly decided to change their All Inclusive evening dining experience from the promised a la carte to sub standard buffet. Myself and several other people complained that they had refused to offer resident guests the usual menu and directed them to a buffet. This was not the arrangement promised and the buffet was an appalling choice of rubbish, pish-pash assortment do cold salads quickly concocted up. My suite was filthy, carpets stained, hairs In bathroom. However,  staff very friendly and reception staff delightful."
Aug 2015,50,Great place! ,"We stayed here in July for one week in the one bedroom apartments with our three children aged 6, 3 and 1. The layout of the place is 1st class with plenty of pools bars and restaurants to ensure that it never feels like the place is packed even though the place was fully booked when we were there. We loved the fish restaurant overlooking the beach and also the one down at the beach though independent from the hotel is great as well. I had seen some negative reviews about the breakfast. I personally couldnt have faulted it. The fresh pastries were first class. The service was also excellent.The beach is on the door step and very easy access. The old town only a short drive away with a free shuttle also.If I had to pick any negatives and this is being very particular the apartments decor is slightly dated for a 5 star establishment and could be modernised somewhat. However ours and familys next door was spotlessly clean with a daily full clean where they even clean your dishes! I did have a couple of small issues with the kids club but these were resolved by the manageress very quickly and generally it was very good. They might want to put more entertainment on in the evenings  although the female singer who was there every night was excellent. More childrens entertainment would be a positive addition. I would love to return again as this was a great experience for all of us. I would give 9 out of 10."
Aug 2015,50,"Perfect location, great resort ",My boyfriend and I just came back from 6 nights here. The location was fantastic with beach access it really makes a difference. The pool and resort grounds were lovely and the service was great! I would recommend a sea view room. We also visited the spa for the most incredible couples massage.Only thing to be aware of is the beds a really hard. Just I case you are expecting a soft bed I don't want you to be disappointed. Breakfast is good large selection of food. We also are at the seafood restaurant. Very fresh and tasty!
Aug 2015,30,5 star resort but 3/4 star hotel.,Visited for one week in August and returned with mixed views about the experience. Arriving at 11.30 am to be told your room won't be ready till 2pm does not give a great first impression. After all they knew I was coming since March! Added to this the very offhand and unhelpful attitude of in particular the reception staff we first encountered was annoying to say the least. We ended up having to open suitcases in the reception area and changed clothing in the toilets. No offer of a spare room or showering facilities was made. Does that strike you as 5 star service?That however was thankfully as bad as it got because the rest of the stay was very enjoyable. All other staff we encountered were helpful and friendly which goes to show how a couple of bad apples can spoil the barrel for all concerned.As for the hotel it's a poor 4 star at best. Stained and worn carpets and in our case curtains barely attached to their fixings speaks of a place in need of investment. Others who we spoke to confirmed this was also the case in their own rooms. The whole impression given by the place is of faded glory in serious need of an update. The outside areas ie.pools etc were very good and well kept.As for the location it's actually a good 4 km outside Albufeira old town and in my opinion certainly not walkable from the hotel  . However leaving the main entrance of the resort and turning left a 10 min walk takes you to the edge of the New town and a busy area of bars and restaurants so your first impression of being stuck in the middle of nowhere proves to be groundless. Breakfast was reasonably good the only criticism being a limited number of hot food options. It seemed much more a continental type breakfast offering which suited me fine I must say.The free hotel bus to Albufeira was a nice bonus but it stops at 8 pm. Taxi back is fairly cheap at 7/8 euros so can't really complain about that.If I could give 4 and a half stars I would do to be fair as we enjoyed our holiday here overall. But the 5 star rating is a bit misleading in my view for the reasons given.
Aug 2015,50,Lovely resort!,We have just returned from a week self catering. Definitely the cleanest we ever stayed in. The grounds are lovely with a choice of pools which are generally quite quiet with no problem getting a sunbed.  Access to beach is down several sets of steps but lovely sandy beach with plenty of sunbeds available.Hotel provides a  bus to new and old town but last bus is at 8pm. If going to old town be prepared for a long wait for the taxi home - expect to wait an hour!  A 15 minute walk will take you into the new town.Hotel provides a beach towel each day for each person - wish we had known beforehand!  If self catering then pack a tea towel and dishcloth although the cleaners will wash your dishes for you.Our only minor complaint was being woken by the cleaners at 10am and also when we were resting in the afternoon despite leaving a picture message on the door!All in all deserves its 5 star rating- hope to return!
Aug 2015,30,A good hotel... but not 5 star,"A good hotel, but not a great hotel and does fall short of a 5 star establishment when compared to other five and some four star hotels I have stayed in previously. A little bit difficult to rate so the best thing to do is outline the good and a few of the minor irritations to provide balance:Summary: Family of 4, 11 night stay, 1 bedroom apartment, self catering.The good:--------------- Excellent reception staff, always pleasant and always helpful- Location is very good right beside the local beach and indeed other local beaches at low tide if you fancy a stroll.  2 recliners and an umbrella will set you back €15 per day or €10 for a half day and there are plenty of water sports on the local beach - Not too near, not too far from Albufeira town (€6-7) taxi ride with plenty of restaurant choices but be prepared for delays after 7pm in the evening both ways (or contact a private operator as we did - check out yourtransfer@hotmail.com)- General area is quiet after 11pm at night, with only a bit of minor road noise at the front of the hotel- One bedroom apartment, good size, excellent air conditioning (one of the best I have come across) with separate controls for the main living quarters and the bedroom. OK facilities for self catering, comfortable beds for the adults and basic pullout bed for the kids.- Free good sized safe- Very good cleaning staff and always very helpful- Good quality sun loungers on the decked pool areas, but a little shortage at times- Free Wifi and 2 TV's with a good general mix of channels- Night time entertainment is low key duet type music (which some may consider on the not so good list!) but we enjoyed the low key approach- Free shuttle bus (up to 27 people) into town a few times a day, can be busy in the evening times- Security seems to be good in the facility also, lots of security cameras!- Nice mixed group of guests from many nationalities and kid friendly too- Kids club, staff and facilities are also very good though geared towards the younger kids, so if you have kids older than 7 or 8, they may find the club a bit limited and games room is OK.- A free good gym is available on site and is well equipped- Well kept hotel reception with only one shop and an art exhibition to view too at the time we were there!- Pool bars were good but a bit limited in food choices but the service was very good- A good choice of beachfront restaurants from the basic snacks to fine seafood dining right behind the hotelThe not so good:------------------------ An as yet unexplained booking problem on arrival between the travel operator & hotel, but to be fair to the hotel, they did accommodate us on the first night once I gave them my credit card. However, we were given the apartment which is the furthest away from the beach, hotel reception, swimming pools etc... but I did not feel we were in much of a position to negotiate that at the time.- There are a number of outdoor swimming pools (four, one heated) on site, but all are very, very small and circular in shape, so if you fancy a bit of swimming exercise, the hotel falls short - check it out on google maps/earth to view directly- There was no sign of any type of welcome pack in our room so a quick trip down to the hotel bar cost me €8 for two bottles of water, which I think is pretty ridiculous in any hotel.- Buffet breakfast on the first morning had a queue of people/families waiting 10 minutes or more just to get in the door. Though we did not go back, I saw much even longer queues other mornings which is simply not five star (with queues up two flights of stairs right up to reception one morning). -The buffet restaurant is simply too small for the number of guests at this facility and at €25 per person with a limited selection and small self service counter area represents poor value and cramped for guests. We did not sample the evening meals at €35 per person due to the breakfast experience but it did seem like much fewer people attended same and the choices seemed more extensive with an extended serving area outdoors.  But there are plenty of alternatives in town and relatively close to the hotel (like ""Martins"")- Getting into and out of town can be difficult (despite the free shuttle service up to 7.20pm) and taxis may take from 20 to 40 minutes to pick you up (not the hotels fault, but still a problem) .- The indoor saltwater spa pool will cost you €20 per person per hour... which I think should be free at any four or five star hotel, these extra charges do add up and irritate- Drinks are certainly five star priced with a kids cocktail costing €6.50, beer, wines and water (previously mentioned) are also costly- Access to the local beach is by walking directly through the outdoor part of the buffet restaurant which is far from ideal if you were a regular diner...- Other parts of the hotel like the raised lounge overlooking the beach seemed to be closed to guests other than wedding partiesAs the complex is large (and sometimes busy with vehicles double parked on footpaths everywhere during weddings), you will have to mind your kids as cars, taxis, buses, electric carts and mopeds go simply too fast around the facility and this is dangerous- If you have any walking impairment or are wheelchair bound (or have kids in a buggy) the entire facility is rough cobble stoned and will be a bit of a disaster for you to get around.- Some noticeable repairs do need to be done e.g. our bidet was blocked, kitchen work top cracked, missing a chair on our patio which never materialized, outside light was not working (but fixed very quickly once reported to maintenance), woodwork feature (pergola) on the patio completely dry-rotted and more dangerously a lot of missing or loose cobble stones around the facility- Bar staff were OK but on ordering drinks one night and asking if they could be delivered downstairs I got a thumbs up, but 15-20 minutes no sign of the drinks so a quick trip back to the bar to check on progress was met with, "" we are not allowed to deliver drinks down stairs""... It would have been nice if someone had popped down and told us that rather than just leaving us waiting- Ground floor apartment ""balconies"" are more of a common pavement separated by wooden trellis and are a little open / lacking privacySo there you have it! It is a very good hotel if it were 3 star rated, average if 4 star, but considerably short for 5 stars.  So 3.5 out of 5 for this hotel."
Aug 2015,40,holiday with the kids..not 5 star though,"Stayed for 5 nights on a multi center trip, having stayed at this hotel previously we pretty much knew what to expect. It is a very good hotel, but not a 5 star, would say 4+ star. Rooms are perfectly clean and comfortable but not luxurious. the pool area is lacking sunbeds leading to the inevitable race down early in order to avoid being beaten to the sunbeds by the 'towel left on sunbed next to a strategically positioned book brigade'. The hotel has 3 restaurants, of which the Santa Eulalia is the best IMO, even better is the superb beach restaurant a short 2 minute walk along the beach which isn't actually part of the hotel. We ate in the main hotel restaurant one night , out of necessity really and i wouldn't bother again, the food was fine but its just typical hotel buffet food.There are no real options for dinner without a taxi ride, which wasnt a problem for us, but is worth considering. It may sound like i am being a bit negative about this place, which i am not....i actually really like it and find it very relaxing, but i do feel it is important that one understands it is not a 5 star experience."
Aug 2015,40,Good experience,After starting on the wrong foot (we had booked a room with sea view and we were given a room with a glimpse of the sea - some discussions occurred and we come to an agreement) things got settled.Staff very friendly and helpful.Resort have all facilities and right on the beach is very convenient.B/fast is buffet and is quite good both in variety and quantity.Every night there is entertainment (singers) which makes life much better otherwise you would have to drive to the village (walking is quite a distance).Also there are a few restaurants in the resort and all quite good.SPA and gym facilities well organised.Overall good experience.
Aug 2015,20,Not a 5 star hotel,"I am currently staying at this hotel.  Ignore the reviewer who said there are enough sunbeds. There are not!!!!  When I complained about this to reception I was basically told ""tough.""  The beach is horrible. Very overcrowded and not at all what is described by the hotel!!  The wifi is extremely intermittent and again reception were very unhelpful. It is definitely not a 5 * hotel"
Aug 2015,10,Overrated,"Sorry I wouldn't visit here again, advertised WiFi non existent, ""it must be your iPhone sir"", yet I travel all over the world with the same phone and never had a problem anywhere else.Then there's the ""secluded beach"", well it might be secluded during sleeping hours, but there's not an inch of beach available during the day.Then there's the numerous pools, but they don't have enough sun loungers, simply not good enough!If you like lots of people, cramped beach, no wifi and no pool side loungers you're welcome, I certainly won't be back, sorry.Not a slur on Portugal or the Algarve by the way!"
Aug 2015,20,"NOT a Romantic holiday - but if you have kids, then you will Love it...","This is a very nice hotel for people that have kids - it's not meant for people that are wanting a Romantic getaway.  It's a bit far from everything so if you want to try different Restaurants, then you will Definitely need a car. I'm very glad we had a car and could visit Lagos and Sagres and especially the Alvor beach.  The restaurant on premise is very nice but you can't eat there every day so make sure you have a car to get to many of the great restaurants along the Algarve coast. My kids are above 18 so if I knew what i know now, then i would not have stayed here.  The seaview rooms are lovely and if you get an apartment, please make sure that it's not too close to the busy road as it would be too noisy.  Excellent for Families, Poor for Romantic couples."
Aug 2015,50,Fantastic Hotel in a great location,"Great hotel in a fantastic location, pools nice and tidy and the large family room was excellent, I couldn't fault this hotel, however we were half board and the bar prices were a bit too excessive for my liking, so we went to the beach bar 200 meters away and that was great...Service was exceptional, my son left his cap in the room when we left, I emailed the hotel and they posted it to my home address DHL 1st class, WOW...All in all a well deserved of 5 stars."
Aug 2015,50,Great - Lovely property and Exceptional Service,Service is Fantastic.  They don't get tips so you have to give them Cash for tips because their service si already fantastic and if you give them tips then its even better! The one restaurant close to the beach (high end) is good food.  Breakfast is good food but coffeee gets cold quickly~
Aug 2015,50,Perfect!,"I wanted a relaxing 4 night weekend break with a couple of friends and that's exactly what we got! We stayed in an apartment and we couldn't fault it. We had a fab view over looking our pool, the apartment itself was clean and had everything you'd need. It was cleaned every day (which we didn't expect) We ate at the beach bar a couple of times and couldn't fault that. We did eat at the fish restaurant on the beach (not part of the hotel) and we would recommend that to anyone (always a good sign when the locals are eating there!) The staff were always helpful and friendly. Beach towels were available every day too. I think a few other reviews have been a bit harsh about the hotel which is such a shame as its a lovely place, very quiet and relaxing. I would stay here again."
Aug 2015,20,Disappointed ,We arrived at the hotel on the 31 st July ready for a celebration of my father turning 70 . We were more than pleased with the hotels appearance and when we saw our room was more than happy.The pool area looked lovely it all turned sour when we went down for dinner on the first night as we were half board there was 12 of us in total my brother had a quick look at the buffet selection which for a supposed 5 star was very disappointing.We immediately went to reception to complain only to be told no manager was available until the next day so we endured the lacklustre buffet.We spoke to the manager the next day and explained our disgust at the food selection and quality he told us to see how we went the next night as there was a theme night and he would talk to us again.Admittedly the food was slightly better the next day but we had decided it still wasn't good enough so we went back to see him he said we could have 20 euro per person off the a la carte if we wanted or have lunch free .In the meantime while around the pool I spotted some lady pointing across to us at the pool to a member of staff I wondered what was going on but thought nothing of it until she started pacing up and down around us and pulled out her phone as if to video my son .At this point I approached her and asked did she have a problem as I have seen you surveying my son and family she said no and quickly left then the staff member she had been with approached my son in the pool and asked him if he had been in the upstairs bar because a lady had her glasses taken.My father went over to ask the man what he was doing approaching my son and he repeated what had happened.When I heard this I was so furious I complained at reception and a manager later contacted us to talk about it fair to say I told them in no uncertain terms that I thought they treated the whole situation disgustingly one being my son was never in that area and two if you have a problem you talk to me not my son who has no clue what's going on.To make matters worse today my family went down for the lunch they were promised today and they said they knew nothing about it.So to sum up what was supposed to be a special occasion for our family it has been a shambles thanks to this hotel.
Aug 2015,40,Lovely Beach Front Hotel,We stayed here for 5 days in July in a studio bungalow . It was very spacious and clean but has very few facilities if you do wish to use for self catering although it does have a fridge and kettle so is sufficient for basic needs. The hotel is situated on the lovely beach of Santa Eulalia which is far away from the hustle and bustle of Albufeira. There are 3 main outdoor pool areas of the hotel and although we were there in the height of season there was never a shortage of sunbeds. We stayed on a room only basis so cannot comment on the food in the restaurants although if you were to have breakfast it is charged at 20 euros which seems quite expensive -it looked a standard hotel buffet style. The spa area is an added bonus. Overall a good hotel-maybe 4 star rather than 5 but no real criticisms.
Jul 2015,50,FAB-U-LOUS,"Stayed here for 10 nights 8-18 July in a suite  which was fantastic - lovely big bedroom and bathroom and lounge area with sofa bed for 2 children to sleep on and another bathroom. Towels changed regularly and bathrobes supplied. Fridge in lounge for storing water and soft drinks. Staff very friendly and helpful at reception and in the restaurant. We were staying on half board basis - breakfast had very good selection of everything, dinner maybe slightly less of a selection but the buffet did change each night. Restaurant was much quieter in evenings as most people were on b&b basis. We were pleasantly surprised by a trolley in our room with cakes and bubbly on our anniversary which the hotel kindly provided - Thank you! Only down side if on b&b basis long wait for taxis at hotel after 7pm."
Jul 2015,40,Another lovely visit,"My wife and 12 yr old son Stayed here under a month in Grand Real, I stayed 1st 2 weeks,& we were joined by other family & friends at different intervals throughout, obviously in pre-booked other apts on the complex. We stayed in a 1 bed apt. Bed & breakfast included, which was excellent.Have been coming here last 3 yrs in a row.We always enjoy our stay here in The Grand Real, our son meets up with the same kids every year and looks forward to catching up with his mates and meeting new ones.Certain members of staff went beyond the call of duty, Filipe in the restaurant always had a warm welcome and went out of his way to help. He was so sweet to my 12 yr old, thank you Filipe! However certain other members including the young gent who stood at the cash register at the evening buffet and a lady,a senior lady/ waitress with long hair in a pony tail were not so professional. Every time I visited( and wished to sign for my evening meal) I was questioned in front of the whole dining room, when I will be paying and did I want to pay for the previous evenings..... This was before we even sat down.....I almost felt they thought I was trying to pull a fast one! It kind of put us off, & we tended to eat out instead of the aggro. Martins restaurant and the many restaurants in the nearby village are great.Joao in the kids club is absolutely wonderful. He is the heart of the kids club. He was always so full of energy and enthusiastic with the kids. We really, really missed Antonio, who was a porter this year. We would love to see him return to the kids club, his smiling infectious enthusiasm is missed greatly.One last gripe, the pillows are very hard and uncomfortable in the apartments. Overall, another enjoyable stay, thank you."
Jul 2015,50,Mr Mc Elhinney ,I recently stayed at this hotel for a week. I stayed in a studio which I thought was home from home. The pools we're fantastic just outside our room and there were more than enough sun loungers to go around. Staff was a great help the only downfall was that my stay was too short
Jul 2015,50,Superb,"We stayed for one week from 12th July in a one bedroom apartment. Lovely apartment, spotless, great air con and comfy bed.  Kids v happy in lounge.Staff are all very helpful and friendly. My daughter has coeliacs disease and they kindly organised gluten free bread and cake.  There was a wonderful breakfast choice for all everyday.Location superb, gorgeous beach. Beach has water sports if you like that kind of thing.  Live music in the atlantico bar wonderful in the evening.  We enjoyed eating at the restaurant actually on the beach - great fish. Taxis are cheap. We went to olhos d aqua a few eves - loads nice restaurants 5 euro in a taxi. Also has a great beach.Lovely pool area - ice lollies for the kids! Walk out of main gate and turn right and supermarket 10 min walk.Sadly whilst away my daughter became unwell and needed her appendix out. The hotel were wonderful. They arranged a doctor. Sorted taxi. Phoned us in the room to ask if they could help with anything. Our jet2 rep mary Jo was superb. She helped us in our hour of need and also visited my daughter in hospital. We love this hotel and the staff.  It is low key but our kids love playing on the beach at night so it suited us perfectly. We have never been back to the same location but we would come back here!"
Jul 2015,50,Great hotel for young familys,"We stayed in a 1 bed apartment, loads of room for 2 adults and 2 children. Pool outside apartments. Staff very friendly. Kids club was well organised. We got private taxi each time as it was cheaper for 2 families with young children."
Jul 2015,50,Quality of Service consistently excellent a very professionally run facility,"We have recently spent 2 weeks family holiday at this hotel it was a wonderful experience great food and great service and importantly the cleaning service was immaculate, pools very family friendly, great service and food throughout the facility.. All in all a memorable and enjoyable family experience.The only issue not related to the hotel is the Taxi service ion Albufeira which is a real problem, there are regular queues for Taxis in the evenings going out of the hotel for meals this is not restricted to the hotel but needs to addressed by the local Business Community."
Jul 2015,50,Flawless!! ,We are currently staying at this hotel and must say we are thoroughly enjoying it! The members of staff cannot do enough for us and have always been there to help. We stayed in a studio apartment which was fabulous. The pool was right outside our window and was lovely. One day there was even a bouncy castle for all the children and face painting. As it was my birthday during our stay a surprise birthday cake was brought up to our apartment with champagne as a present from the hotel. This was a very personal touch. We would recommend this hotel to anyone and we will be returning to this fantastic hotel again!
Jul 2015,50,Ocean view is fantastic,Wake up to the sound of ocean waves and have a wonderful breakfast on your balcony or go down to a Restorant  - all just great! Fantastic hotel with an amazing Spa and treatments and very good restorants ! Love it! 💖 Hotel also organizing  lots of activities for kids and adults - very interesting!
Jul 2015,50,Amazing stay for our honeymoon,"We stayed here on our honeymoon and it was our first experience of a 5 star hotel. I really cannot fault anything during our stay unless I was being really picky and splitting hairs. The only way I can explain some of the negative comments on this site is that those people had an unfortunate stay or they set their standards very high.We asked for a room on a higher floor and mentioned that is was our honeymoon, we also booked a sea view room to get the best view. I didn't quite know what to expect but when we got into the room the view was amazing and we even had a bottle of sparkling wine and some snacks complimentary from the hotel (I assume as it was our honeymoon). The bed we had was massive, I have never seen a bed so wide and it was very comfortable. Overall the room was perfect for us, big balcony, big bathroom with everything we needed (didn't spend too much time in the room anyway).Everywhere we went the staff were very nice and eager to help if we had any questions. Saw a fair few families in the hotel bu there was no major screaming kids running about and the pool was very nice too. Sunbeds were pretty much available all day round and the bars in the hotel were very nice too. Of course it is a hotel and drinks are slightly pricier but if you expect something else then I really don't know what planet you live on.Breakfast I found had a lot of choice and everything that I tried was delicious and freshly cooked. The quality of the produce on offer was very good. We only had breakfast so I cannot rate the day/evening menus as we prefer to make the most of the amazing restaurants in Albufeira (the Old Town being our favourite).We did not make use of the spa but I did use the gym a couple of times and this was also free of charge and the gym was sufficient even for an active sportsman like myself. Definitely above average hotel gym.The hotel offers a free shuttle service that runs six times a day stopping at the Old Town and New Town. It only filled up completely once while we were there and we did make a lot of use of it. The alternative is to get a taxi, fares range from €5-9 depending whether you go the Old Town or New Town and at what time of the day. The New Town can be reached by foot in 15 minutes but this walk does have some hills so may not be an option if this is a difficulty for you. The Old Town is a much longer walk which we did not even attempt.Overall I would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel. Our honeymoon was simply amazing and everything we hoped it would be."
Jul 2015,40,Amazing,My husband and I stayed one week in Grand Santa in Juky it was our 1st time in Alfberia . Our room was nice and clean with clean bed sheets and towels every day.We booked a sea view which was an amazing view from our balcony and listening to waves every morning and night made it very relaxing . The food was excellent along with the staff and the receptionists . A nice pleasant 15 min walk to the strip and I would recommend Teasers restaurant along the way which was very cheap and food was good. The Old town is a must with the bus taking you there and back for free.from the hotel .A lovely place and beach to spend the day there.
Jul 2015,50,fabulous,"wonderful hotel, rooms great with the biggest bed i have ever seen in a hotel. service was good although hotel price were expensive.all staff very friendly and helpful. definitely will go back for longer visit. 10 min walk to praida de oura"
Jul 2015,50,Faultlessly amazing!! ,"Not one for writing reviews normally but after my stay at the grande real I felt I couldn't not! What an absolutely amazing hotel!! I cannot rate it highly enough, the setting,  the hotel, the room,  the facilities.. Beyond my expectations! The staff from first checking in were polite and helpful. The room, we had a sea view room which was so lovely! The facilties were all great and the private beach wow utterly beautiful. And the whole complex utterly immaculately clean. I can honestly say I can not fault anything at all not even a little. If you are thinking of booking do it you won't be disappointed. I am making sure I return next year without fail."
Jul 2015,10,Awful ,"I really would advise you give this hotel a miss. We booked a week away here after staying here in 2006. My memory must be playing tricks on me as I remembered a lovely hotel; not this time. We arrived on Sunday the 5th July at 12.30 to be told our room was not ready, fine we thought we'll have a drink in the bar ( see comments later) firstly the rooms; shabby, dirty carpets and chipped tiles, also a half used toilet roll?!! The reception staff are really rude one day completely ignoring my husband and I, never mind perhaps their English is not good (which it was as we heard her speaking perfect English to another guest minutes later). The breakfast is mediocre the best thing is the fresh orange juice, the ""Al a  carte"" restaurant was permanently closed? Today we vacated our room at 09.30 with the maid cleaning next door and only finally returned at 15.00 and the room was still not cleaned. 15 minutes later we had a card pushed under the door saying could we advise when the room could be cleaned - what a joke six and a half hours to clean a room then advise they were unable to enter."
Jul 2015,50,First Class Hotel,"Looked up Tripadvisor before going on holiday to this Hotel and found mixed reviews, and therefore a bit apprehensive, should not have been, from the moment we arrived it could not have been better.  Beautiful Hotel and the Apartments were terrific.  Short walk to the beach, no towels on chairs by the swimming pools in the morning, plenty of chairs (in fact most mornings I was the only one swimming)Apartments cleaned every day with new towels. Courtesy Bus to Albufeira many times during the day.My birthday was on the Wednesday and a bottle of Prosceco and a birthday cake were delivered by a lovely waiter singing Happy Birthday to me. (my only complaint was he was not a very good singer)My only slight reservation about this place was that it was quite a walk up to the Santa Eulalia and not a huge amount there. However, we went into Albufeira twice a day as there was more to do there and if this Bus did not take us back we got a Taxi which cost about 7 Euros. wifi, air conditioning and safe are all free.Would definately go back."
Jul 2015,40,Good spot,Very pleased with location of hotel and apartments. Our apartment was overlooking the pool which was great. Staff friendly and ready to assist if we rang with a query. Apartments very quiet and clean. Can recommend.
Jul 2015,50,Self catering apartment,"Wow, second time in a row (never usually go back to the same place twice) and it was even better! Out with the UK finding a 5 star experience can be difficult with 5 stars often being just a good 4 star and so on. This is not, this is a proper 5 star, with the service and rooms to match. Fantastic holiday, would not hesitate to booking again. We went for a self catering apartment this time for a family of four which had one room with a monster sized king bed, a separate bathroom and shower area, a kitchen and lounge. Nice and cool, well ventilated with aircon in both the bedroom and lounge area. Sliding doors to small private patio area with tables and chairs. There was a sofa bed and also a single bed. We chose a ground floor as we have a 2 year old. Our apartment was 304, nice spot.There is a pool close to the apartment, in fact two pools only within 50yds to the rear. The pools near to where the apartments are, are much quieter than the pools at the front which does have stunning views down to the beach and over the Atlantic so you have a choice. The baby pool is very shallow and was ideal for our two year old. The larger pools are very nice and very clean. There is a kids club which is located near to the front of the hotel (you can look down at the kids play area from the elevated bar), this is only one of two areas I would mark the hotel down slightly. There are lots of helpers (staff) but they are not co ordinated, they absolutely ensure the safety of the kids but I felt there was no structure to what they were doing, in the most part the children just ran around. The other thing which was a slight negative was the price of drink at the pool side bars, a glass of white wine was 6.50 euros and a beer 4.50 euros, a gin was 7 euros, I felt this was a little steep. And for reference you can buy a half bottle of wine at the pool bar for 8.00 euros so its better value. Lollies were cheap, snacks were cheap, tins of juice were 3.50 euros each which again I thought was high. Other than that though its a fantastic resort, well run, spotless and modern. The terraced bar areas are lovely and they had live music on each night. You are sat outside overlooking the ocean - very nice.There is private access to the beach through a gate which is for hotel residents only, the beach is fantastic, proper powdery sand, no shingle. The sun loungers were 10 Euros a day so we bought a large umbrella from the hotel shop for 23 euros (you can get them cheaper at the supermarkets for around 15 euros. Which worked a treat and saved quite a bit, last time we were there we dropped 100 euros at the beach on hiring parasols. There is a great beach hut/restaurant on the beach called Esplanada O Pescado (nothing to do with the hotel), we went daily for our lunch and drinks. A large beer was 2 euros and the food was very nice and very reasonable. We had a full lunch everyday with drinks, food for four with lollies the whole 9 yards for 40 euros. You will also notice two restaurants when you pass through the secure gate to head to the beach which are on the hotel grounds, these aren’t owned by the hotel but serve good food although the menus is quite limited, one I would say is more snack/lunch based the other more formal. The food is much cheaper than in the hotel and the drink is much cheaper as well. The views are stunning! Regarding hotel location you have a fifteen minute walk before you find shops and bars, if you turn left when you leave the gates you will head up a hill which takes you to brit bars if thats your thing, we didn’t bother but I did enjoy the walk in the morning sun for the rolls and milks etc. There is an intermache supermarket at the tope of the hill which is best priced in the local area. If you turn right when you leave the hotel gates instead you will find the first of two shops which are a much shorter walk, 5 minutes. They are much more expensive but handy. If you want to really save money and stock up on wine and beer, food etc (you have a fridge remember) get a taxi and ask to go to the Continente shopping centre (or ask for the watches at the round about, you will see what I mean when you arrive) there is a hyper market with everything, I mean everything. Prices are amazing, food, drink, everything. Taxo will set you back 12 euros return but you will save that on a 60 euro spend easy!A taxi to the old town is 8 euros if its called through the hotel due to a taxi surcharge, you’ll see the price drop to around 6-7 euros from the old town if you get one at the rank.We went twice to Zoomarine. Great value day out but be warned, there isn’t much shade unless you drop 15 euros for two beds and a sun canopy and the sun can be baking hot if you have little ones. Look it up on trip advisor, if you have children they will love it, excellent day out and food and drink is so cheap which was a real surprise! We used a taxi company who gave us a fixed price of 15 euros there and back.A taxi from the airport return is 60 euros, we used stork transfers http://faroairportprivatetransfers.com/ great to deal with, I made a time change the day before we were returning home by email and the replied straight away and the driver collected us without a hitch. Ive used them twice now. Happy to answer any questions, please email me if you would like to know more. Ps. I tipped the cleaner 15 euros on day one and I couldn’t get her out our apartment, cleaned every day, dishes done - spotless!!"
Jul 2015,40,Very Good with room for Improvements but we will return......,"My review is based on a short 4 night break as a couple looking for an excellent beach with lots of peace and quiet. We also wanted to stay in the resort room and not self cater in their apartmentOverall Comments : As a 5 star resort, we happily rate it 4/5 or 8/10. It is extremely important to realise this is a 5 star 'resort' and not a 5 star 'hotel' and this distinguishing factor is really important to understand before you book your stay and pay the amount they charge. There is no point comparing this place with hotels as that defeats the purpose. I want to highlight that the tourists here were lovely, lots of families and young couples with no brash loud lewd sad drunk folks, which was a very big tick for usLet me try to keep this short and simple, reasons why we loved this place and would return are	1. Exceptional food : Not once did it feel like the buffets were created for mass catering and bulk eating. We enjoyed dinner for 4 nights and lunch 1 day, and have nothin but praise for the spread they put. For dinner, they always served 2 sea food dishes (John Dory, Cod, Calamari, Octopus, Prawns etc), 2 meat dishes (Pork steak, Beef steak, Portugese Chicken/Pork etc), a section for leafy salads, 2 sections for lovely mixed salads and a desert counter including cheese, fruits, cold meats etc. We never felt overwhelmed with the amount they had on display, something you tend to see a lot across resorts in Europe	2. Top quality evening entertainment : Most family friendly resorts tend to focus on kids shows and entertainment all day every day whereas this place is unique. While it has a good variety of programmes through the day to keep kids busy, there is always a nice show on in the evenings. The 4 nights we were there we enjoyed tasteful live performances by good singers. Music is on at the bar from 2030 until 2330 but it isnt so loud as to disturb people in their rooms. They even have a disco and a proper one too as it also hosts weddings and private cocktail parties. There was a famous double act one of the nights but since it actually started at midnight we dint bother going	3. Choice of bars and restaurants : Another point we liked. They have a pool bar serving sandwiches and drinks all morning, a bar overlooking the ocean serving snacks and drinks all day until 0100, the buffet restaurant and another one situated closer to the beach serving excellent fresh fish and meat for dinner/lunch. You can bill everything at these place to your room so you don’t have to carry your cards/cash if you wanted a drink when you returned from the beach. There is also a café that is independent of the hotel that you need to pay for then and there	4. The Half Board Option : While at most resorts it doesn’t make sense going half/full board it does here. Because of its 5 star rating, the buffet costs 32 Euros a head. Yes, the food is great but I would've definitely cursed myself had we not gone with the half board option paying almost 50% less than the 32 euros a head in the hotel. Of course, even if you were to pay 32 euros, an average eater would very easily get back every penny paid for given the lovely spread they had on every night. Also, breakfast is served from 0730 to 1030 and dinner from 1930 to 2230 which are really generous time spans	5. Location, location, location : Cannot praise the location enough. We upgraded to a sea view room and couldn’t be happier. Beautiful views and sounds of the waves crashing down every day.  The beach itself is pristine with blue/green colors and really flat beds so you can walk far out in the water. Its away from the main Albufiera town and about 30 mins from Faro airport. There is a supermarket 5 mins to the right from the resort gates and has everything you need. There is a bus stop just outside the resort. There isnt much within a 10 min walk really but having said that we only walked to the supermarket a few times.	6. Facilities : The room has a fridge to keep things cold and air conditioning, which though doesn’t go below 17C, worked well and kept us cool all night. They have a daily free bus service to old and new town but if you want to take the taxi then they book for you, it costs just 5 euros to new town and 10 to old town. I have already spoken of the bars and restaurants to spend time in. They have 3 pools and lots of sunbeds. The beach is a few mins walk through the resort but you have to pay 10 Euros for half day or 15 euros full day to have 2 sun beds and a brolly, which is worth it if you enjoy lazing on the beach. They do have a money exchange at the reception but no ATM machine. There is also a small store at the reception selling international papers, clothes, touristy stuff, sun tan etc that can be charged to the room. There is a vending machine dispensing cigarettes but not overpriced. There is also the option to enjoy a host of water sports on the beach though we dint try it but a lot of people did and seemed to have a good time. They are 2 tennis courts which are well maintained and used a lot, including kiddie lessons. They also have a fantastic spa which we never had the time to enjoy. Prices are 5 star though!!!	7. Hospitality : Everyone working here is fantastic, yes you may see an unhappy face or two but given the sheer size of this place, it is lovely to see the smile on their faces and general happiness to serve their customers	So, what did we not like or appreciate that much and hence knocking a star off	1. Room quality : No it isnt bad but I'd say it was more 3 star than 5. As all other reviews have stated, rooms are very dated and you can tell it needs TLC to spruce it back to life. Bathroom taps and small wall cracks in the corner dint make you feel 5 stars. The room size was big enough, flat screen TV although just 2 english channels and 2 VH1 channels, none of the usual TV channels you get when outside UK, there is Sky News though. As they don’t mind charging top dollar for the room they need to improve it and make guests feel its worth the money they pay	2. In Room facilities : It is a resort which is why I understand they don’t provide coffee/tea maker but it would be good given there is a balcony to enjoy the views sipping your morning cuppa. They don’t even have an alternative to enjoying drinks/food in your room. Room service has a flat fee of 10 euros so if you order 2 coffees for 4 euros you pay 14 euros which doesn’t make sense. 	3. Water Charges : They charge you a lot for water when you have dinner or lunch. 3 euros for half and 6 euros for a litre of water which is nonsense. The supermarket sells 1.5 litres of water for less 1 euro!!!	4. Pricing : The prices they have for in room service as well as the a la carte menu and drinks are equivalent of a real 5 star hotel. A 5 star resort is not near the quality level of a 5 star hotel and neither should its prices, they could lower it down to pull more people into their bars and restaurants. They are smart given there isnt much choice outside so people don’t mind paying these pricesWe still think that the location, food and service far outweigh its negatives, and I am being really picky with some of the negatives. The live music until 1130 pm and choice of restaurants and bars kept us busy the entire time. When we had nothing to do we spent hours on the balcony enjoying the view with some lovely cold Portugese beersTips : *Try to book early and take the sea view room. The resort view rooms actually means looking over the car park and makes a huge difference waking up to the ocean every morning instead of car park views. *If staying in the resort rooms and not apartments, then go for the half board option as a minimum to save a lot of money. Remember, a buffet meal of any sort paid on the day costs 32 euros a head, way too high*Enjoy the entertainment and enjoy the beach walks"
Jul 2015,40,Great base for swimming with dolphins!,"We went because we needed to be relatively close to Zoomarine.  It was better than expected.  Nice room, lovely beach front fish restaurant and a wonderful late night cocktail bar!  Pay the extra and get away from that ""Benidorm"" feeling!"
Jul 2015,50,My 5th stay & I'll be back!,"This is my home in Portugal. I absolutely can't fault the service, the comfort & the food at Grande Real. The views from the hotel are breathtaking and you have as good as a private beach on your door step. There are two pools and an excellent kids club if you want to lose the little ones for a couple of hours or the whole day. The breakfast buffet is huge, you're almost spoilt for choice, there is literally something for everyone. Try the hotel restaurant on the beach front, it serves authentic Portugese cuisine at a very reasonable price. Whether it's your first time to the Algarve or you have been a few times, a stay here will not be regretted!"
Jul 2015,50,Another great stay!,Just returned from our 3rd stay. Travelled with two 11 year olds. Ticks all the boxes. Staff as friendly and helpful as ever. Made so many new friends and my Portuguese is definitely improving! Will be back for our fourth time soon. Ate logo nossos amigos!
Jul 2015,50,Fabulous resort - excellent facilities and great location,"Have just returned from 7 nights at this resort with my family.  We booked 3 studio apartments through a British Airways deal and stayed on a B&B basis.  The studios were modern, quite large, and were extremely well furnished with a kitchenette, dining table and four chairs, sofa bed (we didn't use this), sofa, huge bed, large wardrobe, safe, air conditioning, bath robes and two TVs.  All 3 studios were on the 1st floor so had balconies furnished with a table and two chairs.  The bathrooms were large and well appointed and each included a hair dryer and double-sided makeup mirror.  The studios were serviced daily by friendly housekeeping staff.  The garden areas around the studios and apartments were well tended and attractive and lovely and quiet at night.As there are a large number of apartments/studios in this resort, they are split into two areas with a circular swimming pool and toddlers' pool in each area.  Each pool area had its own bar/café but only one was open when we were there.  There were plenty of sun loungers around the pools but not very many parasols.  That would be my only gripe about the whole resort.  With temperatures well into the mid 30sC each day and lots of families with young children/toddlers, there needs to be a lot more parasols made available in these pool areas.  Even my adult family members were in need of parasols! Guests could also use the facilities in the main hotel which included the pool area (where there were more parasols); bars and restaurants and the gym. There was also a beautiful Spa area and any treatments are booked and paid for directly to the Spa staff.  Breakfast was served in the main restaurant area which had an outdoor terrace with sea/pool views.  The buffet choice was excellent with plenty of hot and cold food available as well as coffee/tea brought to the tables.  Omlettes/eggs could be cooked to order if desired.  All the resort staff we dealt with treated us in a polite, friendly and helpful manner.The hotel is in an excellent location with wonderful views over the Atlantic and a small beach (which is open to the general public so can become crowded, especially on the weekends).  There were sun loungers and parasols for hire (15 Euros for two loungers and a parasol per day) and a beach bar/restaurant with toilets.  The beach was patrolled by lifeguards and there was also a choice of water sports (at a cost).  The hotel also runs a free shuttle service to and from Albufeira which takes about 15 minutes each way.This hotel resort definitely deserves its 5* rating and I hope to be able to stay there again in the future."
Jul 2015,50,Top Class resort Hotel,"I stayed here in early June and I was well impressed. Check in seamless ,the staff could not do enough for us they were really attentive and pleasant. I stayed in one of the apartment villages with its own communal pool. The room was 1st class. Very clean and rustic .The breakfast was extensive and was a very high standard. Staff again in restaurant was 1st class. They hotel has its own stretch of beach which is amazing. Very clean beach and not to busy. Over all I cant fault this hotel as location was in a quiet and only a 10 min taxi ride to the old town. I will definitely return for a relaxing holliday very soon. !!!!!!"
Jul 2015,40,Nice resort.Not sure about self catering,"Stayed in a one bedroomed apartment for a week with my 8 year old twins on a self catering basis.It was a nice apartment with a big bedroom and two pull out sofa beds.The double was very uncomfortable so would need to be used for light kids the other not so bad.There is a 2 ring ceramic hob which i found could not hold 2 pots.There is also a Combination Oven/Microwave which to be honest I couldn't figure out.I asked for a spatula for the frying pan but they couldn't provide one so all my easy over eggs and omelettes were scrambled by the time i scooped them out of the pan.They don't do egg cups either.I asked for a dish cloth and tea towel they don't do dish cloths but provided a napkin for the tea cloth.The apartments are not very sound proofed as on our second last night we had new neighbours one of which had a snoring problem.One of my kids likened it to a sealion or an elephant and as a result we all had to move into the kitchen.If we had longer to go I would have had to ask to a change of apartments.You get fresh towels every day but had to argue with a 'more than a towel worth' for fresh towels one evening .We were on our way back from the pool and wanted the towels for the morning but he said we had to wait until the morning as its one towel per day.A bit petty I thought as thats all we were doing getting one towel per day but in advance. It is a very well kept resort in a lovely location on a nice beach.There is no problem getting beds by the pool .There is a restaurant Martins a few minutes away which is nice but on a roadside,There is a beach restaurant attached to the hotel and we thought the food not great but it is nice for a drink and cheaper then the hotel bar which is very expensive.A can of coke at the hotel is 3.5 and 2 euro at the beach bar.A glass of wine is 6 euro at the hotel bar.At the pool bar they seemed to ignore my kids and served adults who can behind them.I had to intervene twice .They need to remember whose money the kids are holding.There is another beach restaurant to the right of the hotel accessed from the beach which isn't bad.Otherwise a good 20 minutes walk to restaurants or a taxi ride.The Intermarche supermarket is a long 20 minutes hilly walk which I wouldn't recommend with kids.The small supermarket to the rights does the basics. Overall a nice well kept property but I would prefer a location a bit more central as nice to have a choice of restuarants."
Jul 2015,50,Love this hotel,"Great hotel for comfort and tranquility. Really enjoyed staying here, great facilities and very comfortable. We were there in late September so the weather was lovely and the hotel wasn't over run. Food was delicious, would def go back."
Jul 2015,50,Wedding,My son his fiancee had there wedding here on 29 June 2015 what amazing hotel staff ware lovely  food was beauitiful and what a great night we had .I stayed here last June 2014 and went half board and I must say it has not change what amazing hotel a little bit far from the town but just taxi down the road witch will save the legs if you don't want to walk will cost €5  would go back again
Jul 2015,30,Very disappointing ,"As residents of Portugal, we have been here over 5 time in 12 months and normally very impressed. However the last time let us down..mainly due to 2 reasons - the staff were very poor and not as attentive as they always have been. Also the wine/champagnes were seriously over priced..and we felt out priced the area. It's a shame but we will probably not go back ."
Jul 2015,40,Was hoping it would be good and it was!,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff and great breakfast. The beach is great but a bit of a faff to get to with a toddler as there are lots of steps. Lots of pools so no fighting for sunbeds. The room was large and cleaned to a high standard."
Jul 2015,50,You Won't be disappointed!,"I have stayed in this hotel for 2 family holidays with 2 young children and can highly recommend it. The service is excellent on every level,  the hotel and grounds are fabulous, in a gated complex, right on the beach. It is about a 10 - 15 minute walk to the strip, or a 5 euro taxi ride, and there is also a shuttle bus to the strip and into Albuferia up until 6.00.On both occasions we have booked breakfast, which was good, and eaten in the main restaurant on a couple of nights, which was also good, but we like to take a wander to other restaurants of which there are plenty nearby.There are number of pools with sunbathing areas all gorgeous,we stayed at the main hotel pool, as we had booked one of the suites in the hotel which again was perfect, very spacious,  2 bathrooms 2 balconies, sea view is highly recommended.Also a kids club with playground great,  the beech is just short walk down to the front of the hotel, with a couple of restaurants good for lunch or dinner.This hotel is ideal for a quiet family break, I could not fault it on any level, we will certainly return again....."
Jul 2015,50,Beautiful resort with fantastic views of the Atlantic,What a splendid holiday we had in this 5* resort. We stayed for 7 nights and each night the food was delicious and plenty of it. The staff were friendly and rooms spotless. The decor is very cool in colour and extremely spacious.
Jul 2015,50,Grand real amazing xx,Only home from the most amazing resort on the algarve.... it deserves every star of its 5 ... the views the super friendly staff  cant do enough for you( you dont have a parosol apologies one moment madam i will get one for you  ) ... private beach ... amazing food... spotless clean ... obrigaido grand real .... until next year🌞
Jul 2015,50,Lovely week in the sun,"We stayed in the grande real Santa Eulalia apartments for a week. They are spacious and spotlessly clean. The grounds of the hotel are pretty and there is a choice of swimming pools. The staff were very helpful with any queries we had.We ate at the beach bar a couple of times and I was very impressed by the staff there. My son requires gluten free food, and although they didn't have gluten free bread they immediately offered to get some from the hotel.Both children (10 and 8) have plans already to return next year."
Jul 2015,40,Lovely 10th Anniversary Stay,"We have just returned from a 4 night 10th Anniversary stay and thoroughly enjoyed the visit. It is hard to fault the hotel on any measure, we found the service to be excellent everywhere.  We had breakfast every morning and there was everything you would expect in a major resort hotel. In the evenings we had cocktails at the pool bar and main bar, both excellent. 2 evenings we dined in the a-la-carte restaurant and the food and service was good. We also used the free shuttle bus service to visit the nearby old town both for lunch and for dinner - I can really recommend this, the old town has some great spots to eat and drink especially if you venture off the main drags which are a bit touristy. You have to get a taxi back as the shuttle does not run in the evening - this cost us less then 8 euros.The main pool area was spotless, yes the pools are a tiny bit small  but only if you really want to swim properly. The beach is just a couple on mins walk and we had or proper swims there, the beach was also beautiful and clean and well looked after.A result of the current £/Euro rate, we found the hotel and the town to be pretty good value for money - cocktails for under £4.50 and coffees for less then £1.50 - not bad! We didn't bother with the 32 euro full on lunch (that looked great) and instead opted for the pool bar or Atlantico restaurant which was also cheap but we're talking toasties, pizzas, burgers, salads etc - perhaps this could have been a little more Portugese? That said these lunches also hit the spot - what's wrong with a burger when you can eat lovely fish every night for dinner? Loved the milkshakes!We just had a normal room, not the sea view. The room was fine, yes perhaps a tiny bit small for a 5 star but the room was perfectly clean and the bed very confy. There is free wifi anywhere on the hotel. The spa is lovely, we both had massages - excellent!A number of reviews I've seen question the hotel's 5 stars. I would give the hotel 4 1/3 stars, in my experience. We've stayed in some of the 5 star resorts in Mauritius and some 4 1/2 star spots in the Caribbean and it's not quite there, but It's hard to really find fault when you factor in the price we were paying, maybe we just had a great deal. We are certainly recommending it to our friends, at the very least for a mini-break!"
Jul 2015,50,Wonderful Holiday,"Just returned from 10 nights at the Grande Real and have had a superb holiday! Myself, husband and 2 children and 4 stayed in a one bedroomed apartments whcih was perfectly sized, cleaned every day and well equipped. Staff are so friendly and cant do enough for you! The beach lunch/snack bar serves lovely food, vast lunch menu and all reasonable priced and quick service! Our boys loved the kids club which is open 10 til 6 7 days a week and during school holidays until 10pm. Our boys went twice a day and some days we had to drag them away - the staff are lovely and attentive to the kids. Large supermarket 10-15 mins walk away along the main with a great choice of restaurants and bars near by - we went to 6 differnt restaurants over 10 nights and didnt have one bad meal or experience. My only criticism is that the toddler pool could have been cleaned a little more frequently but we would most definatley return in the future!!"
Jul 2015,30,3rd Stay,"Lovely hotel, great place to come on holiday, however in my opinion not 5 star. Room is comfortable, great big bed, great view. Nice breakfast, nice pool area and right on the beach. Things that disappoint are the hotel appears not to have been updated ie. some staining on room carpets, decking around pool area needing painted. The wifi is painfully slow and drops off continually no matter whereabouts in the hotel you are. The satellite TV channels are very limited so when I wanted to watch some Wimbledon tennis I was directed by hotel staff up to Filips Sports (decent, if not a little grubby, bar with friendly staff) bar 10 minutes walk away towards Albufeira ""Strip"" where the wifi was fast and I could watch Andy Murray on BBC2. When you stay in a 5 star hotel why should you have to seek out a sports bar?"
Jul 2015,30,☆☆☆☆☆it's not probably ☆☆☆,A family of 7 stayed for a week returning June 30th. From flaking paint in the bathroom to cracks in the walls. I had two villas a 1 bedroom villa and a studio villa. On the steps outside going to the pool. There was a rusty nail in the path. Also on the path was a empty cigarette packet that I spotted on our arrival. And 7 days later it was still there. I didn't eat there but I did find the drinks over priced. It is in a great location just a 10min walk to shops and restaurants.  But there was a wedding on ever day so you can't get to sit out on the balcony with the big luxurious sunbeds  ( from the brochure )  now I stayed in 575 and 577. 575 had some cockroaches in the kitchen area cracks on the wall flakes of paint falling from the bathroom ceiling. Ants on the floor ( expected )  pool bar at the pool never opened at all. Even after being told it was opening on Thursday. It hadn't opened by the following Tuesday.  The hotel part is nice but the apartments are far from being 5 star I've stayed in better 3 star hotels. Over priced for what your getting. But I did have a great holiday and staff are lovely.
Jun 2015,50,Wedding,"Visited here for a friends wedding, it is an amazing place great food great drink which is actually expensive, bulmers/magnets is €7.50 local beer is €5.00 normally 2.50 on strip, the views are breath taking over looking the beach for dinner and then to take in sunset"
Jun 2015,50,Excellent hotel,We stayed in this hotel for a special occasion and the staff where so attentive . When we went to our room after check in the was a knock on the door they had prepared a trolley with cakes and champagne to congratulate us! Really nice touch and we were so surprised. Staff and hotel was very nice .
Jun 2015,50,First day but well impressed,Having read a number of poor reviews we really did not know what to expect but we couldn't be happier.  Arrived at 12.15pm expecting our room not to be available until 2pm but we were greeted by pleasant reception staff who took us to our room which is amazing. Very clean air conditioning not working properly mentioned to reception on leaving the hotel returned 2 hours later repaired. If the rest of our week is anything like our first day we will be well happy
Jun 2015,50,Perfect,"1. Get a sea view room it is well worth it2. Spa is amazing as we were the only people in the spa. It does cost extra but is is worth it3. Food in the hotel is lovely but as old town is down the road we didnt eat much here. 4. Wifi it better by the pool. 5. Old town is perfect for restaurants bars and a few clubs but it is a family friendly area. 6. We went in June and there wasn't that many children, never saw any in the evenings. But as there two pools, one heated is full with children and the salt water is cold and perfect to cool off and only adults use that pool.7. Old town for dinner in the evenings is 6Euros taxi recommend Ruina Restaurant beautiful food and view on the sea front. 8. Vilamorea is a 15Euro taxi recommend Mayflower restaurant well worth an evening stroll round the marina. 9. Over all amazing hotel and spa!!!! Would go back!!! Beautiful country."
Jun 2015,30,Average,"This is in no way a 5 star hotel. The views and the staff are its only redeeming feature as the rooms though spotlessly clean are shabby and worn. The hotel needs a lot of attention is. Loose tiles cobble stones, rotting wood, smell of sewage. The food in the buffet was always cold and the selection was poor. The seafood restaurant near the beach was wonderful and the staff were friendly and professional and the food was wonderful. The pools are too small, more like paddling pools and the snack bars food was very poor. I would recommend going self catering and the hotel take away at least two stars"
Jun 2015,40,Good beach restaurant,"We didn't stay at the hotel but ate at their beach restaurant Le Club Restaurant. The view is lovely, the service excellent and the food delicious and well-presented. It was a bit pricey but it is to be expected as it is part of a 5 star hotel. Would definitely recommend visiting it!"
Jun 2015,40,Good Food,"Didn't actually stay at this hotel, but it had a outside restaurant which was open to the public.Had a fabulous table overlooking the beach and sea, ordered the Tropical Salad with chicken and my husband had a sandwich, although this was quite big and beautifully presented. The food was excellent and we did have lunch there twice.Would definitely go again."
Jun 2015,50,Wonderful location for family holiday,"Highly recommend this resort for families. Kids club is very good, staff very friendly and attentive to children. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which was spotless and cleaned every day.One of our children was sick while we stayed and the reception staff were very helpful when organizing a doctor for us."
Jun 2015,20,Not impressed with facilities  hospitality ,"It was a huge let down and I will never stay here again and would encourage anyone considering staying here to look elsewhere.Our intention was to select a hotel which per the website looked very appealing and promised to provide a much needed relaxing holiday. Our experience upon arrival, and during our stay, did not deliver on this need. We felt that many other guest felt similarly unhappy, for various other reasons.From the upkeep of the hotel, the lack of food choice for vegetarians, the quality of the welcome, this self professed 5* hotel, does not deserve the label of Grand nor the star rating. We arrived in an early flight, and transferred to the hotel. There was no welcome, nor any consideration of hospitality from the reception staff, who were definitely not busy.We can understand our room would possibly not yet be ready, and this was confirmed by the receptionist. So we asked for our luggage to be stored away while we explored the facilities. Four hours later, we were horrified to see our luggage still in front of reception; anyone could have walked away with it. We waited till 2pm to be given our room, which was small.To freshen up, my wife had a bath - the bath water would not drain away and she was standing in the used water! We complained 3 times over 3 days (Day 1 to the cleaner who said it would be resolved, Day 2 to the front desk, and then Day 3 by phone to Front Desk) before a maintenance person arrived. The maintenance person revealed that he had not been made aware of the problem prior to Day 3.We insisted on a room change. To think that the hotel staff would happily let us remain in a room with an issue, without themselves arranging a replacement room, shows their lack of concern for guest comfort, and maybe the corporate culture of the hotel.Then drinking water ... could not believe that a 5* hotel does not provide drinking water except on day 1!The sun loungers on the beach can be used, but are charged! There is no kettle in the room. Everything possible is charged for.The gym, which features in the hotel website, is free to use, but only at hours that the spa operates! The gym equipment has not been maintained, a bike pedal is missing. The other bike and the rowing machine are in need of replacement, as are many of the weights.On checkout, I asked for consideration due to the 3 days of inconvenience. The hotel response - that they had provided a room change, so no consideration!It was a huge let down and I will never stay here again and would encourage anyone considering staying here to look elsewhere."
Jun 2015,40,Family friendly,"We stayed at this hotel for a week. We were there for a wedding. We have two kids aged 1 and 2 so we opted to stay in a two bedroom apartment. The apartment was clean and equipped with stove, microwave. The only thing missing was a washing machine (which was abit annoying as out kids go through clothes) the laundry service is very expensive so bear this in mind. €130 for 20 items of clothing! We opted for the breakfast. It had a pretty huge selection but nothing exciting but worth it. I would not recommend the evening buffet which is a waste of money. The hotel pools were great! However only one of them was heated. That was the main pool. We were there in May so it wasn't got enough for the pools to heat up from the sun. Overall, the hotel is very family orientated. Staff are friendly. Their wedding venue is beautiful and had stunning views of the ocean. The beach is very close."
Jun 2015,30,4 not 5 star,"Hi allMyself my wife and our daughter have just returned from this hotel.On first impressions the hotel and grounds seem very nice and well looked after, however on closer inspection you start to see some short fallingsOur room was an ocean view suite which was a good size if not a little dated, the 5 star resorts I have stayed at all over the world have always had tea making facilities and an iron and ironing board ( not this one ) so I called reception to ask for an iron only to be told that would cost me 5 euros ( 5 star eh )Down by the main pool areas the plastic grills around the outside of the pools are black and unclean ( it really should not be like that )Our other main concern was the kids club, on returning to collect our child of 4 on our second day we found her at the top of a climbing area unsupervised and stuck, so glad we turned up when we did, after complaining to the duty manager that evening we received a bottle of wine and some cake. On a more worrying note we were talking to a couple with a young boy who were using the kids club also and on one occasion they dropped the boy off for a few hours and returned to the pool area to relax only after a while the young boy somehow escaped the kids club and made his way back up to the pool area where thankfully his grandparents spotted him, we told the family to complain to the management but they just told the kids club  supervisors.would we stay again.Well I love the location and the beach but I don't think it's great value for money and I haven't even mentioned the breakfast ( awful ) but I doubt very much that we would return"
Jun 2015,50,We'll be back,"My wife and I stayed at Grand Real Santa Eulalia for 10 days in early June. It is a vast complex with many apartments with their own parking and pool areas. We stayed in the main hotel on a full board basis and in a suite with sea view. We were in room 339 on the third floor, with wonderful views of the sea and beach. The rooms are spacious and very well equipped with everything you would expect from a hotel of this status, with perhaps the exception of tea & coffee making facilities. Every member of staff was polite and courteous and go out of their way to help in any way possible. We had just one isolated and unexpected experience when we were shown to our table one evening by Vasco who appeared to be quite rude and rather arrogant, perhaps he was simply having a bad day!Breakfast, lunch and evening meals were all beautifully prepared and presented with a good selection. Best to get down before 9am or 9pm to avoid queuing. Some have said the deserts selection is poor, however we did not find this to be the case, the selection is very good, but at times the replenishment is a little slow. Generally most guests dress appropriately for evening meals but the odd few gentlemen (and ladies) make no effort and walk in looking as if they have just come from the beach in shorts and t-shirts. It is a family hotel and as such quite a number of children were there, however most were not yet at school age and they were reasonably quiet and enjoying themselves with their parents.Most of the time there are ample sun loungers available, usually by midday there are only a few left. This did not however prevent just one or two guests from reserving prime position beds before 8am in the morning. Two couples very selfishly put towels on 4 loungers for just two occupants, totally unnecessary. The beach is accessed via a secure gate, room key required, and offers spectacular sea views on the walk down. Worth stopping for a meal, coffee or ice cream at the snack bar on the way up or down. If you want to swim, as you go onto the beach keep left to avoid masses of seaweed, the sand is much nicer on the left hand side and sun beds are available. It is a public beach and can get busy.The hotel is free from insects; during our stay we saw just one fly which is a testament to the cleanliness of the whole complex.Some of the feedback regarding this hotel is somewhat negative, the hotel is without doubt a five star, but it is perhaps some of the guests who are not!"
Jun 2015,20,3 star hotel,"Although the outdoor areas are nice, as is the reception area and the beautiful sea view from the pool, the rest is terrible! Average breakfast and a REALLY small room, oddly designed with an outdated decor. The room layout is very strange with a small bed and in some places you can't even fit a small bag between the bed and the wall. The bathroom is also outdated with ugly shower curtains. Despite all this the price is still high! Needs either to be classed as 3 or 4 star or major renovation!"
Jun 2015,40,Nice family hotel,Staff are so lovely and will go out of their way for you and are very good with children. The hotel grounds are also lovely with just a very short walk to the beach. The only downside is the food. Dinner is very repetitive and they only seem to put a small amount out at a time so makes you not want to take as much as you would like. The dinner wasn't suitable for my fussy 2 year old who mainly likes food he knows i.e. chips etc and it wasn't until a couple of days in to the holiday I found out (from another guest) there was a child's menu that they don't offer out unless you ask.
Jun 2015,40,Beautiful Resort & Family Friendly,"The pros: Gorgeous property with direct beach access, excellent breakfast, friendly staff ready to please.  Fantastic spa (get the cranial massage).  The location is a quick walk or cab ride into town, while feeling completely isolated while on the property.  This is a very family-friendly resort, with activities and menus appropriate to their customer base.  The accommodations were spacious and had plenty of storage.  We had an ocean-facing room (worth it!) on the top floor and slept to the sound of ocean waves crashing on the beach.The cons: The interior of the hotel is very dark and the room décor is a bit...unusual.  There is not an ATM on the property, so be prepared to walk into town or come with plenty of cash on hand for tips, etc.  The pool can get crowded early on.Keep in mind, this is a family hotel.  If you are on a couples retreat or traveling alone for some R&R, know this before booking.  The pool is very lively during the day!"
Jun 2015,20,4* resort 2* dining .... It won't be what you've paid for,"This hotel was very disappointing. The 5* experience failed badly to live up to expectations.The rooms were dated and had dreadful decor. Most of what you see advertised on site was either closed ( end of May? ?) or not available to paying guests, just to private parties, weddings etc.The dining area was small and the food was dreadful to say the least. Limited choice and poor quality. Drinks 9 euros for 2 beers, give 10 euros and don't expect your change back.This hotel cares more about catering for weddings etc, there was one happening  whilst we were there and the whole entourage, including the bride, walked by the pool amongst sun bathers.I booked this hotel expecting something different to the 4* hotels we normally book and it was a huge let down. There are far better hotels in Albuferia, save your money and book elsewhere."
Jun 2015,50,1st Anniversary Visit.,"We got married here in May 2014, and  wanted to return for our first anniversary. I booked, and requested the room we stayed in last year. This wasn't guaranteed, but was requested. I was delighted when we checked in and the hotel had managed to get us into the same room. They also sent us Champagne to our room at the time we had got married the year before.I cannot fault our stay at the hotel. This place will always hold sentimental value to myself & husband, with it being our wedding venue.But the hotel & staff never disappoint. Thank you to everyone at the hotel for making our 1st Anniversary so special.Hopefully we can return for our 2nd anniversary next year."
Jun 2015,50,Good for families,Really good hotel for families.....our children loved it! Food is good and friendly staff. There are various pools doted around complex and it's a short walk to the beach with some nice views. Visited SPA -  good too! There is a restaurant just on the beach walk that looks like its attached to the hotel (not sure if it is or not ) it's at the side as you walk down to the beach but staff there are very stressed and generally unfriendly but good for snacks IF you can get served! Over all a good hotel experience!
Jun 2015,30,"Good holiday, hotel rooms awful!","Stayed here for 5 nights May/June.It's a lovely hotel but showing signs of age in the rooms. We booked a sea view suite but when we checked in there was no afternoon/evening sun which was a waste of 2 balconies and with a toddler we wanted evening/afternoon sun if she wanted to nap in the room. There were no other rooms available but a helpful receptionist sorted us out with a standard room. It was a downgrade but she also changed the price to reflect that. Bottle of cava and fruit sent to room by way of welcome which was so nice of them! Note - The cava costs €8 per glass in the bar but the same one is €3 per bottle in the supermarket!In summary:The positives- loved the location. Secluded but could go to Olhos D'Agua which is less than 5 min drive. Didn't like Albuferia which is 10 mins other direction, at all when we went in for couple hour but knew that before we booked here! And there's no real reason to leave the resort.- beach front cafe is very good value and amazing scenery- service has been very friendly and excellent - cleaners to chefs to reception, all great. - never had to go early for a sunbed at the main pool areas. Maybe peak summer is different though.- contrary to other reports the place wasn't over run with kids in the evening, in fact I saw almost none in the lobby bar for 3 nights!!- fantastic spa area, €20 for an hour which is not worth it though. We had passes included in our package.- great pools and having one heated was brilliant especially for kids.The negatives- the carpets in the room are stained, filthy dirty and worn bare in places, couldn't let my toddler walk barefoot on them and not a hope of us doing so. Wooden floors or decent carpet would be way more hygienic. We met people who stayed in the apts and they said they were all tiles and cleaner.- Hallways very dark and some lights missing. Bit eery.- buffet in the evening didn't have a lot of choice and when I asked if there was ala carte I was told no only to discover there was later that evening. Buffet was expensive at €34pp. We read on the website that there was a choice of restaurants but the second one wasn't opened yet and that was disappointing. - drinks etc are expensive but that's what you get when booking what's classed here as 5star. Still couldn't believe they were more expensive than where we had stayed previously in Vilamoura ! Wine being €6 a glass v €3 in Crowne Plaza Vilamoura. CP was a far superior accommodation.All in all we liked the resort but I honestly couldn't stay in one of the hotel rooms again. Having been in two of them they both had dirty carpets which was off putting and not a coincidence as another couple said the same. It's not what I'd expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel. That said we would possibly try the apartments having heard good things or else yet the Epic Sana resort nearby."
Jun 2015,40,Very pleasent holiday but not ideal for disabled,"Stayed here at the end of May in an apartment with my wife and 3yr old grandson. Lovely well equipped accommodation and a great large comfortable bed. The swimming pool close to our block was not in use so we used the heated one by the hotel. Just the right temperature for us and our grandson loved it. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the maids were excellent. The beach is close by and is very nice, beds and parasols a bit pricy though. Located in a quiet area, main strip about 20/30 minute walk but a free bus to Albufeira New and Old Town. The one down side for us is that my wife uses a wheelchair and paths and roads around the complex, to the beach and surrounding area are not easily accessible, so wouldn't be holidaying here again."
Jun 2015,50,Excellent property,"Just back from this property , stayed last week 2 adts + 2 chd age 3 & 4. I stayed in the apartments which worked out well. They have 2 sofa beds,  1 single and 1 double. Full kitchenette  with microwave. The property was spotlessly cleaned everyday. Kids club was great for younger kids, 3 pool and direct access to beach. Food lovely and staff excellent, €5 euros into albuferia, supermarket 10 minutes walk away."
May 2015,30,Showing its age,Pleasant hotel with very nice staff however cannot be considered a 5 star location. The resort is starting to show its age and really needs updating:- hallways are dark even during the day- poor bathroom lighting- rooms lack full length mirrors- room carpets showing signs of wear and tear- room aircon is not very powerful- pools are smallGood points- sea view- staff- hotel bar is excellent- very good beach
May 2015,50,Fabulous Holiday,"Stayed for 9 nights in early May 2015. 2 adults & 2 children in an apartment. Apartment was very spacious with 2 bedrooms & 2 bathrooms. It was immaculate & was cleaned everyday. The buffet breakfast each morning was lovely with lots of fresh fruits, breads, cheese, cereals, yogurts, full fry, champagne & cakes. There are a number of pools. Three pools at the hotel. We had a pool and kids pool near our apartment there was also the same size pools with the apartments on the other side of the complex. Three nights we had the buffet dinner, I felt it could have had more selection for a five star especially the desserts. Access to the beach is gained with your key card. It's a fabulous beach & only a two minute walk. My kids went to kids club for a couple of hours each morning. They're 3 & 4 and thoroughly enjoyed it. There is a play area connected to the kids club with a slide and climbing frame. Staff in kids club were lovely. Very friendly & the kids had no problem staying with them. All the staff were so friendly from reception to waiters, the lady in the shop who helped me with bikini selection. Highly recommend & we will definitely return"
May 2015,50,Fabulous Hotel And For A Wedding Venue,"We went to this hotel for our daughters wedding. There were 48 people in our party staying at the hotel and everyone enjoyed the week and all said they would like to return to the hotel again for another holiday. It is also child friendly hotel.Food, Customer Service & Facilities are excellent.The only downside was the Wifi connection was a bit intermittent but it was free."
May 2015,40,Hotel/Apartment,"Stayed here for 10 days in an apartment with our three and a half yr old grandson and he loved the heated outdoor pool,there are other unheated pools. We had a lovely time here. Friendly hotel staff and well equipped apartments. Only down side was I'm a wheelchair user and the resort entrance and up to the reception and apartments there are large cobblestones which are quite uncomfortable underfoot and impossible to use the wheelchair on, very very bumpy indeed. The beach is close by and very lovely but also difficult access for wheelchairs. Would not go there again due to this reason."
May 2015,50,Great Holiday!!,"First time in the Algarve and we loved it!This hotel is great with lovely accommodation and great location for the beach.It has several nice pool areas around the complex some quieter than others.We found the staff very helpful and friendly including the free bus driver who on our first day when we caught at the wrong time dropped us near the hotel and saved our feet. 20 minute walk from hotel to ""The Strip"" which isn't too bad after a good evening meal while it settles.We preferred the atmosphere of the Old Town at night for which we used the last free shuttle bus then taxi return (approx.7 Euros).Was my birthday while there and was pleasantly surprised to return to the room after a day out to find a bottle of Champagne & a birthday cake along with a lovely birthday message.Option to pay for wifi within your room but found the free wifi in the restaurants, reception & around the pool areas adequate.Would definitely visit again"
May 2015,40,Good hotel during the day but evenings can get a bit manic!,"We have stayed before and I have previously reviewed this hotel, we had a lovely room with a sea view with just a couple of minor issues, one being the balcony chairs were all damaged and would have made sitting in them painful in swim wear or shorts, these were quickly changed on request and an unpainted area where some work had been done and not repainted in the room colour, just filled. Harsh maybe but this is supposed to be a 5 star hotel.The room and bed was very comfortable and the maid service excellent, note we did have soft mattress toppers on our massive bed which helped soften the otherwise hard mattress.We found all the staff to be very attentive, polite and helpful especially at breakfast and in the pool bar which serves lovely cocktails.We were on a B&B basis so would go out early evening to eat and have a night cap in the terrace bar, this was a great way to finish the day off, but be warned in the evening all the young families seemed to congregate in the bar area and it seemed to transform into a children's play area and push chair park, many children were well behaved but some just ruined it for those who wanted a quiet drink, and we witnessed many people complaining about the noise and disruption to each other including us!It would appear that many of the young families are staying in the apartments and enjoying the hotel bar facilities in the evening,One final thing the breakfasts are great, sitting out on the pool terrace with your day ahead of you takes some beating."
May 2015,40,"Great hotel, slightly let down by entertainment and evening meals","Just back from the hotel and while we loved the hotel, it did have some downsides.First, the good stuff. The hotel itself is superb, it is in a great location with a lovely beach just a few meters away. Service was on the whole, great (with one exception, see later). Breakfast was great - a good selection of rolls, pastries, hot and cold food and even glasses of champagne (or cava). No HP sauce though.. ;)  The pool areas (there are more than one) are great for kids and adults alike.We booked an apartment (separate bedroom and lounge), which was superb.. It was spacious, even had a mini-kitchen and we loved it..Now the not so good.. The entertainment seemed like an afterthought. The days there was evening entertainment, they were stuck in a corner of the main hotel lobby. Not ideal when you have a toddler and wanted to let them loose (a bit). Maybe we've been spoiled in the past but there were almost always an outdoor amphitheter with kids disco and games - plus adult entertainment and activites during the day. You'd think the hotel would want to keep people around?We normally tip cleaners at the end of the holiday - do this at your peril here as they will steadily reduce your toiletries (and toilet rolls - not ideal when you've got 3 people with sniffles) until you cough up some cash.. Yes, you could complain to reception, but some euros soon bought much better 'memory' and things were back to normal.The evening restaurant wasn't great. Poor selection of food for the price and it's definitely not cheap.. We're glad we went breakfast only - though we did try it out.. Good news is that there are some great restaurants nearby or a quick shuttle bus away.Wifi (if you need or want it) is flaky around the entire complex - apart from reception.Lastly, it's not really walking distance to the old town - though the shuttle buses were great. They could go on a bit later to cater for early returns for those with kids but better than nothing..Would we go back? Not until the kids are older.."
May 2015,50,loved it,"Came with my young family and had a fantastic stay. My main points are1 As advertised a child friendly place with lots of excited young children all having the time of their lives (happy parents)2 Clean and very tidy. The option for clean towels each day for the pool or the beach (2 mins away) makes for a hassle free day as their is no need for sand to be dragged into the room.3 freindly and attentive staff who catered to all our needs4 an excellent taxi service provided by May (ask at reception) a family run private service who were extremely friendly5 a cheap taxi fare from old town albufeira6 gorgeous weather7 excellent resteraunts within walking taxi ( Martins,casa velha)8 gorgeous weather9 Some really excellent live music in the bar at nightThe only downside was the ignorance of some other nationalities when queuing for the free bus into albufeira ( think of beach towels on a sun lounger and you get the picture) although after complaining to the staff they arranged a free ride into the town with a local private transport company.Would like to thank all your staff"
May 2015,50,Great place for a short break!,"We have just returned from this hotel after a short 4 night stay. We arrived at midday and was greeted very well by the reception staff who told us that we had been upgraded to a suite with a sea view.!! The room was lovely with everything we needed and more. We are in our mid fifties and just wanted a short break away from a busy life at home, so it was great. The only negative I would say is that there were so many toddlers. Not that it bothered us, as they were all very well behaved,but I have never seen so many round the pool. The hotel boasts that it is family orientated so cannot blame that on the hotel, but sometimes it would have been nice to have some quiet time. We found the food  to be perfectly adequate, and the breakfasts were excellent. We got the free bus twice, which was great and always on time. The weather was great too, which always helps. Would I recommend this hotel....definitely! All the rooms and corridoors are carpeted which makes everything so quiet, and we had a very comfy bed and slept so well too. We did not venture far as we were only there for a short time, but it is a lovely retreat away from the hustle and bustle!"
May 2015,50,"""Almost, but not quite perfect""",I have stayed in numerable hotels in Albufeira and this has to ranked No 1 on my list. I decided to treat my better half and managed to secure a suite overlooking the sea. There was a problem with the suite allocated but to their credit the matter was resolved relatively quickly by the management and the second suite was actually better and afforded a far better view.Although outside Albufeira the hotel runs a courtesy bus which we didn't use as the local taxi service is very good and generally reasonable.The hotel itself has everything you would need to have an enjoyable holiday and the picturesque beach is only 2 minutes from the hotel.I stayed on a bed and breakfast basis and in hindsight glad that I didn't opt for full or half board. I did eat in the hotel one evening and opted for the buffet which frankly was disappointing based on limited choice and the cost. This hotel really has to look at other 5 star establishments and address the way it caters for its guests. The choice of and presentation of the food should be improved.The staff were without exception friendly and courteous and the rooms spotlessly cleanOverall I would have no hesitancy in recommending this hotel.
May 2015,40,no much to do and see around,"we were in end of march until the end of april 15  we had an appartement clean but noisy  no insonorisation  we had eveything we need in it for kitchen /wifi/ tv  cleaning every day wich was nice and the staff very nice peoples but albufera is way too much commercial we were there 20 years or so it was Portugal typical we will never go back  and the food is lousy all over, good thing we manage to do our own cooking"
May 2015,50,Great Stay,"The hotel facilities and staff are excellent, two of the pools were closed, however the main pool area had plenty room and sufficient loungers.Location is a little out, about 10-15-minute walk to the local supermarket, but we liked this. 15-minutes to the strip and a 7-8 euro taxi to old town.Two minor problems were dealt with promptly."
May 2015,40,Our Second Visit...,"We visited  a couple of years ago and found the location to be perfect for our needs. This time we were on the 3rd Floor in room 315. The rooms are starting to look a little tired in places and the fridge stopped working after 3 days. The hotel WiFi is atrocious, poor speeds, poor connection and completely unreliable. The system obviously cannot cope with the demands placed upon it, and the Hotel wasn't full!! We use WiFi a lot to research places to visit, restaurants etc... it was more reliable to use our 3G connection.Breakfast is the standard european buffet, and there is enough choice to find something you will like. The service is still slow, but the staff are pleasant.We do not eat in the restaurant, as we found it be expensive and poor quality on our last visit, and based on comments from fellow travellers, nothing has changed. There are plenty of lovely local restaurants only a few steps from the main gate.The service in the main bar terrace is slow & painful at times, the view is fantastic and relaxing, the cocktails are lovely.If you get a good deal on the price, I would highly recommend this Hotel, but not at the 200euros a night they want.I can imagine during peak months, i.e. july, aug, sept then it would be extremely busy, we were there 3rd week in may and the Pool was extremely busy and full of screaming children."
May 2015,50,"Loved it, again.",This is a great hotel at a very reasonable price. Maybe not 5 star by UK standards but a very good 4 star. Pool area very child friendly with plenty of sunbeds. Easy access to the beach. Breakfast is a very enjoyable experience with plenty of choice. Highly recommended hotel and resort. I'll be back at Easter with family in tow.
May 2015,50,Fantastic,"Amazing hotel! We had a fantastic 4 day stay. The staff  were lovely, the hotel was really clean. The breakfast was brilliant and a great choice for the evening meal. The views are wonderful. The bed was huge in a very comfortable room. Nothing but praise for this great hotel with a real wow factor or arrival. We will defiantly be returning!!!"
May 2015,30,Very relaxing time spent,"Ok we are leaving this hotel in 12 hours so its time to write a review.Owerall we had relaxing week, beach was close, weather was great, the apartment we stayed in was absolutely great a lot of space clean, free safe wich is always needed on holidays now the bad points... We seemed not connected with staff at all reception staff was always rude when we first arrived to check in there was 3 members of staff there but we where ignored for good few minutes, whenever we had a guestion its seemed to be ansvered in very short sentince with no care at all, when we call to book a taxi from reception we where told we have to come up its not possiblle to do it over the phone so we actually had to wait 20 min at the reception for a taxi .Reception staff always seemed to be very busy so never had time to even say hello wich is very poor in my eyes especally if its 5 star hotel! There is no entertaiment at all in a evenings wich is crazy coz hotel is very far from the old town. Ok lets move on to a positives we went to eat a lot in a Atlantico restaurant wich had great food and very friendly staff especally young fella name Rui! He was sooooo friendly always with a big smile on his face always inturested on how we are, i have to say he was the one that made us comeback to eat there all the time great manners ! Some staff should definelty learn few things from him on costumer service, so definetly BIG thankyou to Rui and best of luck in his job! The other odd thing we found was the water on the beach seem to be very very dark dirty on some days... Ok the main question i guess is would i stay here i again ?! Well im coming to algarve again in september but will i pick this hotel again i honestly have to say i dont know as i dont feel like its a 5 star resort it seems with lack of costumer service from bar staff and reception staff i would have to say its more like a 4 star resort oh by the way the wifi in our apartment was gonna for day and a half"
May 2015,40,Best you'll get near Albufeira,"Just back from 10 day holiday at Grande Resort Santa Elulia.  The hotel is excellent. Spotlessly clean, spacious with all the expected facilities. The staff were great too. Its more suited to families than Execs so dont expect the tranquil boutique Spa thing.The only negatives were the food, which is average but not special and the lack of evening entertainment.  Overall though excellent for a beach holiday.  Book it!"
May 2015,40,Enchanting beach .. delightful staff .. good food .. noisy kids,"We, as a couple, have just spent a truly memorable week at the Santa Eulalia to celebrate our 21st wedding anniversary. Our room on the top floor had a wonderful view of the sea, sandy beach and nearby cliffs and woods (actually more interesting than a continuous beach running for miles on either side). [A tip for newcomers booking: the best rooms are on the 3rd (top) floor and, oddly, have balconies which alternate between being shaded and open to the sun - the former making sunbathing impossible, but offering pleasant sitting on a hot day, the latter ideal for sunbathing, but affording no shade].Our room (n. 313 with shaded balcony) was attractive and perfectly clean but the well-equipped bathroom was frequently filled with a dreadful smell of sewage, which repeated clearing of the bathroom drains by willing staff failed to remove for long. Various staff seemed well accustomed to the problem and all blamed the ocean tides (although we never understood exactly how the tides had this evil effect!). This frequent smell from the bathroom would never be cause enough by itself for us to avoid the hotel in future - but the management MUST find a proper solution (probably involving a complete cleanout or renewal of the hotel's entire sewage & air vent system).The staff were, at every level, attentive, genuinely kind and very friendly, helpful and efficient, as was the customer services manageress Ca'tia Sa'. The food in the buffet restaurant (the a' la carte restaurant opening later in the season) was good; initially we felt that, although nicely presented, many of the different cold salads and various other dishes tended to be bland and taste all much the same within their grouping. However, from the beginning of the following week, the variety and intensity of different flavours increased noticeably (or so it seemed to us) and our brief change to a' la carte dishes (made available to us at extra cost) no longer seemed necessary. Compared with the buffet in some large 5* hotels, the choice of dishes does perhaps appear relatively limited - however, many elements of the menu are changed daily and it really must be said that our overall dining experience was in fact excellent.Children - crying, screaming or just excitedly shouting - were everywhere. There was virtually no place in the hotel (apart from our room) or on the beach where one could be free of the sound of disruptive kids. However the hotel clearly advertises itself as a family hotel and we knew there was this risk before we booked. This is good for those who come with screaming kids of their own, because there will be so many others that they will fit in without embarrassment - but if one is not accustomed to the constant disturbance and has not the ability simply to close one's mind and ears to it, then it does detract from the overall experience. [An idea might be for the hotel to have adults-only dining after, say, 9.30 pm and/or to set aside some area(s) for adults only; however this would clearly not be an easy thing to do.]In summary therefore, although in our own case both ear and nose plugs would doubtless have helped on occasion, the fact remains that we had a truly delightful and memorable time at this very pleasantly staffed hotel and we commend it most highly."
May 2015,40,First family holiday - for a special wedding,"My husband and I and our ten month old baby spent a week here in May 2015, three of 50 guests for the destination wedding of close friends at the resort.We were nervous about taking our little one away for the first time, but are so glad we did. Everything went smoothly and our daughter and both of us had a wonderful time.We flew from Southampton with FlyBe, which was fantastic, and used Algarve 365 for the transfer to the hotel. They come highly recommended, reasonable, reliable and provided an immaculate Maxi Cosi car seat free of charge.Check in was smooth and we were soon being taken to our very comfortable and clean apartment by golf buggy. A couple of maintenance issues were dealt with promptly and a high chair provided immediately on request. The one bedroom apartment was spacious with a nice terrace. The kitchenette has plenty of pots and pans and cutlery but only a hob and microwave for cooking. There are a good bath and shower.We chose bed and breakfast and considered it extremely good value. The hotel would not be graded 5* in the UK, but is lovely nonetheless. There was excellent variety at breakfast, the fruit, cheese and pastries preferable to the cooked breakfast. We ate the barbecue lunch once and enjoyed it. Friends who opted for half or full board were disappointed at the selection. With full occupancy, more restaurants and pools should have been opened.There are plenty of restaurants and supermarkets within walking distance, the pick being O Pescadoro, which is the beach cafe in the day. It enjoys spectacular views and spectacular fish and seafood from 6pm!The wedding we attended was truly special, set against a stunning backdrop with fantastic food and drink. A really wonderful venue for a special event.Other days were mostly spent at the lovely main pool area (the only one with a heated pool at this time of year) and gorgeous beach (sun loungers and umbrellas extra).The bar staff arranged for a TV channel to be changed so a group of us could watch our beloved Saints back home in the Premier League one day.We used the free hotel shuttle bus (family day out with little one in baby carrier) and taxis (hen and stag nights) to access lively Albufeira. The Old Town is around 15 minutes away by car.We were impressed with the kids club, a nice little added extra for families, and I enjoyed a massage in the deserted spa. It's a shame you can't use the facilities when having a treatment, as would be usual in the UK, without paying extra.Paula, the reception manager, was kind enough to arrange us a 2pm late check out free of charge."
May 2015,50,"Very relaxing time, great staff","I went on my own with my daughter who is nine and we felt very well looked after. The staff are great and we would definitely go again. There is a great adventure park down the road too (like Go Ape but loads cheaper) that we went to every day. The beach is beautiful, the pools are lovely - a really lovely relaxing holiday."
May 2015,30,Certainly not 5*,"having just returned from this hotel,  no way is this a 5* hotel more like just about 4*The corridors where the rooms were  very dingy  the lobby in the rooms were dingy as well there was no main light in the ceiling  , even with the lamps beside the beds on still very dingy.  The food way too much cold selection and not enough hot food,  the pool area was way to cramped up you could hardly move between the beds.  Hardly any umbrellas on the beach so very exposed.   The only ladies toilet near the pool of which there was only one , the flush was busted  and didn't flush properly. Then on the last day of my holiday the top of the cistern and been removed so you couldn't even flush it.  The pool bar the choice of menu very boring.  I will not ever go back there again4 times I had to ask to get the air conditioning working properly.  Then another day asked 4 times to get a broken light replaced.  This hotel need to get a lot of things sorted out"
May 2015,40,Good hotel - a good distance from old town,"We stayed here as a family of four for one week (2 adults and 2 children aged 2.5 and 7 months).AccomodationWe stayed in a 1 bed apartment which was very nice and had all the facilites needed when travelling with small children. The apartment was very spacious and the decor was very nice. The hotel accomodated our request for an early check in and arranged for two travel cots to be place in the room. Cleaning staff were excellent. There were 2 pools close to the apartments neither of these were heated but as the weather was very good this didnt matter to us. Tip:- request an apartment close to the hotel entrance especially if travelling with small children. FoodWe stayed on a half board basis. The hotel provided vouchers which could be used for either lunch or dinner. We mainly ate at lunch time and found the selection to be better than the evening meal time. The choice of food was a bit limited although the quality was excellent. I thought in particular there should have been more choice for deserts. Drinks were expensive (4 euro for a large bottle of water, 3 euro for a coke and 4.50 for a beer). On the first evening we were offered a childrens menu for our 2.5 year old son. This provided a good choice. However when we asked for a scoop of ice cream for his desert we were informed that we would be charged 3 euro for this. We were not offered the childrens menu for the rest of our stay. Choice and quality of the breakfast was particularly good. Tip: Room service was very expensive (10 euro service charge) and the choice was limited. However there was a very nice pizzeria just outside the hotel (to the left as you come out of the gate) that does take away. ServiceStaff throughout the hotel were very good and were particularly friendly in the restaurant. We were a bit disappointed that there was a charge of 20 euros to use the indoor pool. There is a good kids club with plenty of activities during the day. We brought our 2.5 year old a couple of times and he really enjoyed it. However, there is no entertainment for adults of children in the evening.Wifi was free and reasonably good. LocationThe hotel is quite a distance from the new and old town. There is an area with restaurants and shops about 20 minutes walk. The new town is about a 30 minute walk and the old town is a good 50 minute walk. The walk is along a busy road and is not the nicest or most scenic of walks.The hotel provided a shuttle bus to the old town. We used this on a number of occasions. There were two different drivers, one was very helpful (with the buggy) the other driver was not. The service ran 4 or 5 times a day with the last bus around 6.30. While the service was great, I felt the last bus back to the hotel was a little early. A taxi from the old town cost 8 euros. In summary, this is a lovely hotel probably more of a good 4 star than 5 star. We probably wouldnt stay here again due to the location but would recommend it for those seeking a quiet getaway."
May 2015,50,Time with the family,"Spent 5 days recently at this hotel with the family, the kids loved the pool areas - one of which was heated)and the beach. The hotel was lovely, the room spacious, very clean, all the staff were lovely and friendly. We went half board and the food was good. The Atlantico bar. Where we spent a couple of lunchtimes was excellent."
May 2015,50,AMAZING!!!!!! never fails to let us down.,just spent another amazing week in the grande real it is our 8 time my wife and i can not fault this hotel the staff were excellent as ever the guys at the cafe bar atlantico were excellent service flawless and the maids also deserve a special mention c u again very soon !!!!!!!!
May 2015,50,THIS IS what you call a hotel.,"The Santa Eulalia is a very well centred hotel in Albufeira.The staff are very friendly and courteous, and very knowledgeable about the area, so were happy to advise on anything we needed to know.Everything in this hotel made the grade.  It was clean, spacious, and very well maintained.  The pool area was constantly kept clean and tidy.  The rooms are very spacious and more than adequate, with everything working as it should.  The maid service was second to none, with bedding changed every fourth day, and towels replaced as needed.  Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff.  Suitable for couples and families alike.  Although this hotel is classed as a 4*, it is most definitely more than that.There was also an indoor spa, sauna and steam room (6 euros per person or 10 euros for 2, for the day.  Well recommended.  The bar was well stocked, and the staff very knowledgeable.  The restaurant is large, clean and the food smelled very nice, but I can't comment on taste, as we never used the restaurant in the hotel.  There was evening entertainment in the bar on various nights, very rarely heard in the apartments.  There was also children's entertainment during the afternoons - water polo, darts, archery, etc, and the cocktail game (higher or lower card game) and Stickies (bingo with cards) for all.  Free wifi for the duration of your stay, and good connectivity.  Well maintained and clean lifts throughout this hotel, making it very wheelchair or pushchair friendly.Situated well within Albufeira's Santa Eulalia/Paia do Ora area, and within easy reach of many eateries, shops and supermarket (Intermarche) and pharmacy.(see reviews on Annabels, Paulos Italian (who deliver to the hotel), The Chinese Royal (who do takeaways for you to collect), the Chinese Buffet, and Carpe Diem to name a few).Highly recommend visiting ZooMarine and Albufeira market (every first and third Tuesday of the month).  Also a trip to Albufeira old town well worth a visit. For views of this hotel, check out their website: Exactly as seen, so didn't need to take photo's ourselves.  Make your own mind up:http://www.conforhoteis.pt/en/Menu/Hotels/Santa-Eulalia/Gallery.aspx"
May 2015,40,lovely hotel but dinner not up to a 4/5 star,Lovely hotel in a beautiful setting. Not much to do in area so used the hotel courtesy bus to go to albufeira a few evenings. The breakfasts were OK but the dinners were poor compared to other hotels I have visited. Stayed in 2 bedroom apartment which was lovely but the colours scheme a bit bright. Plenty of space with two bathrooms which was useful
May 2015,40,90%,"Just returned today 15/5, stayed half board.First the 90%, a stunning hotel, in its own grounds surrounded by villa's with amazing sea views to the rear of the hotel,to me it's in the perfect place just nicely secluded but only 20 mins walk to the new town and an hour walk to the old town,or they provide free buses to new and old town.like a lot hotels a fortune must have been spent on the reception area,I was not disapointed with the rest of the hotel,sea wave patterns in the corridors carpets, a little touch of the animal kingdom about the place bamboo effect etc,the rooms are spot on in themselves.our room was a little down the side of the hotel but still had a good sea view. Very clean(even checked for dust, clean as a whistle) very large bed,patio doors open right up to about 6ft,nice touch.the staff are 1st class, the restaurant staff,cleaners spot on.a can do attitude. 2 round pools 1 cold and 1 heated,nice sun beds. Amazing sea views. Now the -10%. on arriving at our room we only had a bottle of warmish water,no fruit or anything just water,fridge empty. The air con was ok-just.wi fi a tad iffy. As I said earlier the restaurant staff are spot on,the food was nice but not the best selection I have come across,not much for veggies.the desert bar is only about 4ft long,so kept running out,Deserts got replaced but slow,never came across ice cream. Drinks not the cheapest. Maybe I am a little harsh,but for a little more thought it would be perfect,all said it is 5 star. Would I stay again, yes i would."
May 2015,50,"Great hotel, best in albufeira",The hotel rooms and apartments are spacious and extremely clean. The hotel staff are more than helpful and there are plenty of pools to choose from. We had a great time and only payed around 65 pound a night. Would definitely recommend it and go back. The beach is fabulous.
May 2015,40,nice hotel and beach not five star though.,"Clean spacious rooms cosy beds good breakfast. Nice pools one was heated which wasNice. A bit remote if you want to go out in albufeira, you can get the courtesy bus but last one is 6.20 pm. Taxis cost around 8euros and the drivers are grumpy and bad mannered. Some of the staff grumpy also and not very accommodating but some were very nice especially Paula on reception who was most helpful. Food and drinks a bit pricey."
May 2015,40,Very relaxing lovely hotel and holiday,"The hotel was excellent, immaculately clean and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. We had booked a one bedroom apartment half board but when we got there we were given a suite with a fantastic view, we went to reception to explain we had the wrong accommodation and were told we could move into an apartment the following day if we wished. The suite was fantastic but had no tea/coffee making facilities but this was remedied by the hotel who provided a kettle and cups so we stayed in the suite and had a really comfortable stay. Only negative points about the hotel were that the pools were very cold (as quite early in the season) and although breakfast was really good some of the evening meals were average, and I would have quite liked to have had the option of ice cream for dessert. There was not much information provided about the hotel in the rooms however if you asked at reception they told you everything you needed to knowThe gym was very well equipped and free to use and although it officially opened at 9 am, if you asked at reception they would let you use it from 7 am so you could work out before breakfast.We were told that you could not get along to Albufeira Old town via the beaches but with a bit of a scramble we managed to walk along the coast into the Old town which was a lovely walk taking about 1 hr with breaks taking in the stunning scenery. We caught a taxi back which cost about 6 euros. All in all a lovely stay in a lovely hotel."
May 2015,40,Great beachside location,"This hotel has a great beach side location and over looks the beach.It is a large hotel which can seem a bit impersonal. The rooms are spacious and have good size bathroom.The shower over the bath is not thermostatic and can be difficult to regulate. The beds are comfortable. The air conditioning is individually controlled. There is a small fridge in the room.The sea facing rooms are probably better as many of the room face the entrance / car parking area.Out of season the only restaurant is the only one open and can be busy. Not a relaxing place to eat. The beach restaurant is a good option for a lunch time snack.There are a few shops and small restaurants locally but you have to catch the bus or a taxi into the main resort centre. The pool area has plenty of sun beds and two pools one of which is heated, both pools are not overly large so do get busy.The spa offers a range of massages.The staff were helpful and polite.Overall  a great option for family's but if you are looking for a peaceful break then is will not be the place for you."
May 2015,50,Excellent ,"We are leaving today after a 4 night break.After a good 3 hour flight, the resort was only around 30 minutes from the airport. On arrival it was as good as it looked in the promo material.  The check in was simple, our bags were taken to our room; as were we on a golf buggy.  We had a one bedroom studio apartment; spacious and clean with everything you need for self catering.  Free Wi-fi too.Our experience was that the staff were very friendly and professional; we are quite self sufficient so don't need much but the times we visited reception we got the information we needed.  Staff in the bar and restaurants were polite and welcoming.  As we are a little off-season not all restaurants were open.  Our only negative is that, after 7pm all other areas that serve food are closed and the Cozinas restaurant is the only place open for food; wewere unable to book a table for the two of us; still not sure why; I think it's because it is the boarders restaurant and people are seated at tables of 6. No offence but we wanted romance eating with a view of the ocean not sitting with 4 strangers!  As a result we went off the resort for our evening meal as we had no other choice.The pools are great; plenty of space, beds and another pool and bathing area round by the apartments. Follow the path down onto the beach and it's just glorious; right on your doorstep.We used the Spa; unlimited use for the day for €20 each; it's a Thalassotherapy pool which is why there is a charge and €3 each for a cap; I think that is reasonable. I also went back and had the Hot Stones treatment with was wonderful.This is not a 'ravers' place; but we wanted to have sun, relax, eat with a few drinks in a bit of luxury and we certainly achieved that. Overall we have had a great time and would certainly recommend it to people looking for a relaxing tranquil break."
May 2015,50,Fantastic Family Holiday,"We had a fantastic family holiday here. We booked a resort two bedroom apartment which was spacious, clean and well decorated.As a family of 4 with two children aged 3 and 1 we had been looking for a resort which offered family friendly facilities and service but was also somewhere adults could enjoy. This is harder than it would seem but the Grande Real resort was a perfect mix for us.We had booked self catering(as other hotels we had been to where we had booked half board had restaurants where the food and service were very disappointing) but this wasn't the case here and we wish we had opted for the half board option as buffet restaurant was lovely. We dined there 3 times and every time the service and food were very good. On the other nights we dined at the fish restaurant on the beach which was also very good.The location of the hotel is perfect if you don't really want to venture away from the hotel and with two small kids we stayed in the general area. Most days we played on the beach and returned to the hotel to use the swimming pool in late afternoon when the temperature there had cooled a bit. (It was 27 degrees when we holidayed)The views from the pool area, Bar and restaurant are just amazing and any photo I tried to take did't do it justice.There was a communal pool in the area of the resort apartment but we only used the main pool as this was heated to a lovely temperature.Both my kids loved the playground at the kids club and playing with some of the toys within the kids club. The staff there were really friendly.We are definitely going to return and this time we will book half board to enjoy more of the restaurants."
May 2015,20,Definitely not a 5*,"Disappointed with this hotel. Location - terrible. You need to hire a car or get taxis if you want to get off the resort. They have an hourly shuttle bus to the town which stops at 6pmPoor wifi, hit & miss staff, weird rules to try & get money from you. Spa - makes you pay 3 euros for a shower cap - another way to make money."
May 2015,50,A wonderful family friendly resort!,"We have just returned from a weeks stay at the Grande Real in Albufeira. It was our second visit as we enjoyed our frst so much. We were given the same room that we stayed in before which was delightful, clean, quiet and the bed was enormous. There was also a bottle of champagne waiting for us when we returned to our room on the first evening with a lovely note wishing me a happy birthday from the staff at the Grand Real. I later found out that it was Marisa on reception who noticed my date of birth on my passport and followed up with the lovely gesture. Very thoughtful indeed. If you are booking a room at this hotel you must include breakfast as we thought it was amazing. The chef was on hand to make me fresh porridge every morning and cook an omelette of your choosing if you so desire. The fresh fruit was delicious as was the selection of breads, cheeses and cooked meats. There was even champagne to wash all that lovely food down!All in all this is a wonderful hotel, excellent value for money and certainly one which we will return at the earliest opportunity. Keep up the good work Grande Real Santa Eulalia resort & Spa."
May 2015,50,"Brilliant, relaxing, Great!!!","We arrived late on a Saturday and were greeted by very friendly reception staff, book-in was effortless, we were taken to our room by golf buggy and bags taken into our room by very nice staff.  Room was great and met all expectations - bed was huge!!  We decided to eat at the restaurant on first night and was very good and staff very attentive, we are there again during our week which was also very good.The room was cleaned every day and clean towels, also clean pool towels every day do no need to pack your own😀Free shuttle bus into old and new town on regular basis which is nice to see but no real need to leave hotel as plenty to do there.  Pools very good and plenty of loungers, a short walk down to the stunning beach is well worth it, the views are amazing!!! There is a bar on the beach which is very good, food and drinks good value and the staff amazing (especially Laize)Very relaxing hotel, good weather all round great experience 😍"
May 2015,50,Loved it,"Really lovely holiday. Went with my 6 year old and he loved it to. Quite liked the fact it wasn't in the middle of albufeira which had wall to wall restaurants and nightlife. The studio apartment was spotless, spacious and quiet and even had blackout curtains. We could have done with pots and pans in the kitchenette though. The onsite beach and heated outdoor pool were great. The algarve is really a beautiful place. The reception staff were always gracious and helpful . We don't know about the restaurant as we didn't eat in the hotel. Will definitely be back soon."
May 2015,30,"Not much style, not much substance...","We just got back after a wonderful week of Portuguese sunshine and adventures. This is what we thought of the hotel:- the staff are hit and miss. The reception staff are great. We had a bad experience with the two bar staff one evening which ruined our evening. When we complained the hotel offered us two passes to the spa. We declined the gesture as it came with a warning that we would be required to purchase swimming caps and we really weren't interested in spending another euro in the hotel after the  awful and rude service of the unprofessional bar staff. The staff will not acknowledge or greet you unless you do it first.- we stayed in a studio apartment and it was a really good size for the two of us. It was equiped with everything we needed. If you turn left out the hotel gates and down into the little village there is an intermarche. It's bigger and cheaper than the ones to the right but slightly further away. The apartment was cleaned every day and we were given fresh towels. We left the last of our euros for the cleaning staff in appreciation of their hard work.-we had one meal in the hotels restaurant and ordered off the a la carte on our first evening as we arrived late. The waiters  were friendly but less than attentive which was quite annoying when you're tired. This was the first impression if the hitel. The food was ok. I would  say the portions are a bit on the small side for the price. We got back to our room and the hotel had given us a complimentary bottle of sparking wine with some desserts. A lovely gesture although the desserts  didn't seem very fresh. - there is a complimentary hotel shuttle every hour from 10am ish until 6pm ish  to Albufiera old and new town. We didn't  bother with the new town but the old town was lovely to walk around and we had a great meal on the sea front of monkfish and prawn capalana  and Algarvian paella. Definitely try the paella. It's scrumptious and served to you at your table  with a bit of flare and drama. A bit of fun! :)- one morning we had breakfast at the hotel beach cafe. The service was excellent and prices very reasonable. €4.50 for scrambled egg and the most delicious smokey bacon on toast. Gorgeous view over the beach. We had a banana milkshake too which was yum but didn't last long! :)- the swimming pools were good and not overcrowded. The beaches were immaculately kept and beautiful with the caves and cliffs creating interest.- everything was extra at the hotel. €10 for an hour of tennis, €1 to play pool, €20 for a day in the indoor pool... annoying when we weren't  able to charge things to the room and settle bill at the end of our trip. Means you have to carry cash everywhere. - a receptionist printed off our boarding passes which was easy and a relief. I just checked in on my phone and emailed the passes as pdfs to the hotel email. She was helpful and charming. - overall the hotel was ok. The lobby was impressive and the wifi was good but not available anywhere else on the property. There is a way to go yet with the consistency  of the staff in their delivery  of 5* service.  Towel boys standing around gossiping is not a good impression to have at the reception desk. It was nice to have our bags taken to the room and driving us on the golf buggy to our accommodation. It would have been a good touch to pick us up when checking out...or at least to offer. Check out was at 10am. The hotel could have let us check out later knowing our transfers to the airport were at 5pm. It worked out ok but these little details define a 5* at the end of the day. Things to do... - we booked an excursion to Saville through the hotel which cost €36 each. later we saw the same excursion advertised for €20 in the village which is 10/15 mins walk from the hotel. Saville was beautiful and well  worth the visit. We paid 7.50 to get into the cathedral and didn't pay the 3 for the guides. We should have because there is absolutely  no information on the cathedral once inside whatsoever. We had lunch in the Jewish quatre  at a locals restaurant.  It was great. The only thing I would say is that the drop off coming back took absolutely  ages waiting for people to be dropped off but you get to see loads of the algarve quickly I suppose. The tour guide was good although very  repetitive which we saw the funny side of. - we walked from santa eulalia all the way to villamoura along the cliffs. It was a great and unexpected adventure. It took 4 hours and was quite rugged  in places. The perfect  adventure for us. Beautiful and worth doing if you wear trainers and are reasonably fit. On another occasion we walked to praia de oura and walked and swam along the coast to the beaches and back to santa eulalia. It was really  exhilarating but If you are going to do it then  I would suggest doing it only on a very calm day and take trainers or sturdy flip flops. Praia Oura is a more lively beach and we had lunch at the 'green' restaurant nearer the end which had a lovely atmosphere and great food. We ordered from the snack menu and the portion was larger than expected. Very responsible prices and the waiter was attentive and charming.-villamoura harbour is beautiful and nice to have lunch and do a little bit of shopping. We had burgers at the Captain's we fancied something a bit more meaty after eating so much delicious sea food. Excellent burger cooked medium at €4.50 without chips. - we got the local bus a couple of times which was always on time. Each way to villamoura is €4.10ish which is a bit pricey but it only takes 25 mins one way. - we played crazy golf at the family golf park. €14 for 18 holes but only €2 more for 36. We shoulve  done the 36 holes because it only  took us20ish mins to do 18! Overall it was fun and they have food and drinks available  with a nice seating area. The algarve is beautiful and everywhere we went the streets were so clean and well kept. The highlights were Saville, the cliff top walk from santa eulalia to villamoura, the weather, the food (especially the traditional Portuguese pastries and black coffee), the beaches and the vino! :) We ♡ Portugal! Carry water with you wherever  you go! It gets extremely hot so remember to keep hydrated!"
May 2015,30,five star hotel not five star food,"i'm beginning to think my wife and I stayed at a different hotel as I would agree the hotel was spotless, the room exactly what i'd booked and kept clean, the pool areas spotless and the prices in the hotel expensive however if you go down to the atlantico bar you will realize they have a dual pricing policy and the drinks are quite a bit cheaper there, a bit naughty, food wise I found breakfast to be ok not a lot to spoil there but the evening meal? I went half board was terrible very limited choice not hot and not very palatable in fact we tried it two nights and then ate out every night after this and while we were there we never saw the restaurant full at all, I spoke to the food and beverage manager who admitted the menu is a limited choice menu I would say very limited, I spoke to a member of staff who said they have had food issues and I know of at least two other couples who took the same option as myself and ate out, I would add the hotel did agree to downgrade me to b&b fair play to them but I am still waiting for some sort of refund, I can only say that this was a birthday trip for me and was totally spoilt by all the hassle, did however get a cake and drink from the hotel,would I go again probably not unless I went b&b or the food issues became five star catering and not what I would class 3star catering"
Apr 2015,50,Brilliant!!!,"My wife and I are currently staying at the Grande Real. The staff are welcoming, friendly and always very helpful. Our room is modern, clean and the bed is very comfy. On the whole we are very pleased with every aspect of the hotel. Its great just to stroll two minutes to the beautiful beach and soak up the sun. Its a short taxi ride or free shuttle to the Old town, a lively place with many bars and restaurants. We are already thinking of coming back in September."
Apr 2015,50,Beautiful hotel ,"I stayed here with my one year old daughter, mother in law and her friend. We stayed in one of the studio apartments. The accomodation was superb, decorated in traditional Hispanic style and extremely well maintained and clean.  The bedroom had a double bed and the sofas converted into surprisingly comfy double beds also.  I loved the apartment and spent a lot of time there with daughter, relaxing out on the balcony.  The apartment was self catering but we found a shop in a hotel resort across the road which was very convenient.It's a bus ride to the old town which is about two miles away but we only made the trip once during our stay.  The bus runs from outside the hotel lobby everyday, which is really handy, and returns at set times from the old town everyday. The rest of the time was spent on the beach which was reserved for guests, at the heated swimming pool and out on the balcony of our room.  The new town is about 10 mins walk away and caters for all tastes, although many of the bars were filled with young clubbers, the atmosphere was very relaxed and friendly. Food in the restaurant was a bit expensive but very tasty and fresh nonetheless.  There is a little food place on the way out to the beach which made excellent food and at a good price.There were other facilities - gym, childrens activities, spa and sauna, however I didn't feel the need to use them at this stay.In summary I would completely recommend this resort to any family as it is a one stop place, with little need to travel as almost everything is catered for.  I would definitely be visiting this resort again in the future.  Many thanks to all the staff for their great hospitality and help during our stay!"
Apr 2015,30,Good hotel not great,Good points:> Good sized beach area within walking distance from all hotel room and apartments.> Hotel was very clean.> Good views> Many pools and sun loungers available.> Good service from restaurant staff.> Good quality food available but limited in menu options.> Additional pools located away from main hotel outside apartment buildings> Apartment nicely decorated.Bad points> Hotel staff could have been a whole lot more friendlier and more helpful. > Only two restaurants open during our stay.> Ludicrous charges for drinks based on full board stay.> A charge of 23 euro per person per visit to use the indoor spa pool and sauna even when booked on a full board basis!> Very little night time entertainment.> Booked was we thought was a suite and ended up with an apartment.> Staff at cafe atlantico situated near the beach are extremely rude and lack in customer      service skills.> Not a 5* star hotel in my opinion. 4 and a half stars would be more suitable.>
Apr 2015,50,High standard with great views,"This is probably the best hotel we ever stayed in. The location on the cliff side is amazing , the view spectacular .As well as the hotel there is villas and apartments on the complex. The gardens are well tended. The beach is right at the front of the hotel.There is a bus that takes you into Albuferia free of charge from the hotel .Getting to the hotel was also easy , we booked with a online private transfer company called yelowfish they were really fantastic, meeting us in the arrivals hall with our name on a computer tablet .They had a baby egg for our 4 month old and a booster back seat for our 4 year old , really well organised . We also got a bottle of wine as a gift from the company."
Apr 2015,50,Lovely hotel,"We visited the first week of easter holiday with our two children (7 and 4).The hotel decor was really beautiful, staff extremely helpful and our apartment was clean and comfortable. I'm surprised at some of the comments on the food. We were delighted with the variety and the use of local fresh produce. The breakfast buffet had everything you could want and more and the waiting staff were excellent. The location is great if you want to explore the Algarve, which we did by hiring a car. The coastline is stunning and there are lots of picture postcard towns to explore. If you want to stay local , the hotel runs a free shuttle bus into the old and new town . It's personal taste but I wasn't impressed with Albufeira at all. I found it to be very tired and run down and pretty tacky in parts : I was so glad that we had such a great hotel with such good facilities. The pool area was great and the kids club staff were very professional.My only criticism of the hotel was that it would have been nice to have some entertainment in the evening. I'm sure they want to maintain a certain serenity in the hotel but even some local musicians or background music would have created a bit more of an atmosphere. Very quiet.I would recommend this hotel and would definitely return but not in April- weather was too unpredictable and quite cold at times."
Apr 2015,50,Lovely Hotel In Great Location,"Just came back from this hotel and wish I was still there. It's in a great location right next to the beach looking out to sea, not far from the new town part of Albufeira. The reception staff were helpful, friendly and polite despite our numerous requests throughout our stay. We stayed in a suite overlooking the swimming pools and the sea and a highly recommend room 243 :-). The room sizes were large with a decent size bathroom with the usual safe and fridge. If you want an iron though be prepared to pay 5 Euros per day for the privilege. At the time we went, there was only one of the 3 pools at the back of the main hotel that was heated and the other 2 were a little too cold to go in so consequently on occasion the heated pool was busy. To be honest I think this hotel could do with one big super duper pool and a small kids pool rather than the 3 circular pools it has.Food was absolutely fine and the lunch especially good, just don't forget your food vouchers each mealtime (except breakfast). Drinks were priced very fairly for a 5 star hotel (probably a 4 star by UK standard) with a pint of beer 4.50 Euros. The upstairs bar makes great cocktails too with a large menu to choose from. Entertainment wise, not great. usually one man bands with an instrument and a portable speaker but because everything else was great and we went in a large group it was not really an issue. For the kids there is a kids club house and small park which our lot loved and went to after breakfast every day. If your children are under 3 years old though you will have to stay with them there so no sloping off for beer :-)There is a free shuttle from the hotel into town every few hours too that some might find useful but to be honest the Taxi's were so cheap we just used them. Another plus (or negative) is that there is excellent WiFi throughout the hotel so if you were hoping to get away from work or keep the kids of FiFa 15 that might not happen :-)"
Apr 2015,50,Peaceful delight in the Algarve..,"2nd visit to this hotel and again another excellent experience. Well run, friendly staff & overall great! Highly recommend to all, couples and families. The hotel has excellent facilities. Breakfast is abundant and there's something for everyone."
Apr 2015,50,1st-9th April ,"We stayed here over Easter it was a lovely place, It didn't have the feel or the noise of a large complex the apartments where private enough. The beach was a private beach and the restaurant over looking the beach was really good. The staff were helpful and friendly. The only problem we did have was on 3rd day we woke up to the bathroom flooded this was due to a burst pipe upstairs apartment. We called the front desk and the problem was dealt with swiftly, we ended up moving apartments the general manager and duty manager could not do enough to help.I would recommend this complex to anyone a really relaxing and fun stay we all had"
Apr 2015,40,Easter holiday break.,"Stayed here for a week April 5th to 12th.Firstly the hotel and all the staff where fantastic.We had a suite on the second floor with a sea view.very nice and very spacious suite with two bathrooms .Rooms where cleaned every day cleaners do a fantastic job a credit to the hotel.We stayed bed and breakfast.good choice every day..all quite nice .dining staff also very polite .Bar prices seemed quite expensive,and also food prices on an evening quite expensive but it is a five star hotel.suprised that you also had to pay to use indoor pool 20 Euros each.main outdoor pool was freezing smaller pool okay which most people used.so quite busy.The hotel itself is situated about 10 to 15 mins walk to nearest shops and bars okay if weather is fine we had a couple of day of rain.not so nice.And its only 25 minute walk to bottom of main strip.Courtesy bus goes to new town and old town about 4 times a day but only caters fof 27 people at a time don't know if it would be any different in high season.so overall hotel 10/10,and location 8/10."
Apr 2015,50,Easter Break,"Beautiful Hotel, 4/5 Star, clean and staff are so friendly. The weather hasn't been fantastic but hasn't stopped us doing anything. Free wifi available, kids club, amazing spa and hairdressers on site. We stayed in an apartment for 3 ppl, beds hard but had the best nights sleep, clean, towels changed daily, main bedroom and very useful kitchenette, could quite easily sleep 4. Pool area very clean and tidy. We we're actually here with family for Passover but the one day we did eat the pancakes and toast was yummy. Taxi to and from new and old town not a million miles away. Beach location and a lovely down beach too. Zoo marine fantastic for kids and adults alike. A very very nice location for a family's holiday any time of the year"
Apr 2015,50,Fantastic holiday,"We had an excellent week at Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and Hotel Spa over the first week of the Easter break. We are a family of four who flew into Faro airport from Leeds and made our way to the resort by taxi. When we arrived at the resort, we were warmly welcomed by the porter who got our bags out of the car. The reception staff made the check in process a breeze and explained everything we needed to know well. The only thing which we were not informed of was that the check out was at 10 am, which was a minor issue. The suite we were allocated was the first from the entrance but was not as noisy as we expected. It was clean and tidy. It had a partial kitchen we did not have to use as we had paid for full board!!The food and the restaurant staff were excellent. There was a good choice of both vegetarian and non vegetarian food. The breakfasts were hearty and tasty. The lunch and dinner menus got slightly repetitive after three days. One idea to spice things up a bit would be to have themed days perhaps. My wife struggles with the vegetarian fare available one night and spoke to the restaurant manager about it. He went out of his way to get (an excellent) vegetarian pizza made especially for her!!The staff at the Kids' club were again very good and polite. They gave us all the information we needed and the times of the various activities was very well sign posted near the restaurant. The club was moved from its designated area to another large space in the main building as the actual area was deemed too hot for the kids. This was very helpful for them.The suites were cleaned daily to a very high standard and the staff were very efficient. We had very good quality (and free) wifi in the rooms as standard which was a life saver especially with the children using iPads regularly.We had free transport into the town which was about ten minutes away. This was always on time and efficient. Again, the times and frequency was very well advertised within the resort.The beach was about five minutes walk from the reception. The access to the resort from the beach was restricted which reassured us about the importance given to the safety of the residents.The swimming pools were very well maintained. We had a smaller pool near our suite. Staff at reception arranged for sun chairs and parasols to be put out on our request. I found all the staff at this resort took pride at serving us and making our stay great. This was from the porter to the cleaning staff to the reception staff and the restaurant staff. I have seen this in very few places and in my view, this reflects excellent work put in by the hotel management who I am sure have kept staff morale high.Positives: Location, service, free wifiNegatives (are quite minor): Drinks can be pricey if you havent opted for all inclusive, rooms do not have glasses for water although they have wine glasses.All in all, a great holiday. Returned fully refreshed and recharged. Would definitely visit again!!!"
Apr 2015,40,Relaxing week,"Great location a bit away from the hustle and bustle, we hired a car so it suited us but might be a little inconvenient if you were without transport. Staff were super and room was more than adequate, we asked for a poolside room and were beside a lovely quiet pool with lots of loungers, beach was very nice and access was easy through the main hotel lobby. We had chosen a room only option as we like to have more choice and there are lots of restaurants a short distance away and were glad that we had. Prices within the hotel reflect the 5 star rating at 3.50 for a can of diet Pepsi! The spa is very well appointed and the staff very pleasant."
Apr 2015,50,FABULOUS !!!!!!!!!!,"Well all I can say is The Grande Real Santa Eulalia is fantastic place to stay ,we stayed self catering in a studio apt ,the room was spotless ,cleaned every ,towels changed every day the staff I found were very helpful and courteous ,we will be returning very soon to this hotel cannot recommend it enough .The management of this hotel should be very proud of yourselves it was a pleasure to stay in such a lovely place .!!!!"
Apr 2015,50,Great Experience in Albufeira,"The Grand Real Santa Eulalia is so well run, the staff are superb, in every department.   Whoever trains the staff is to be praised, they are all very polite, quick and efficient, attending to our every need.The Hotel itself is very clean and well kept, we thought it was brand new( 10 years old).  The food choices were very good, especially for my wife, all gluten free food available at each meal.  Our lovely suite 339 has been perfect, with its beautiful view over the ocean"
Apr 2015,30,Average holiday,"So the accommodation and food were great, but the staff were no where near as friendly as Club Riu Guarana. We went with our 5 year old and 8 month old. On one evening, I was stuck in the apartment with our baby boy sleeping on my chest, as he was exhausted. My husband took our daughter to dinner and tried to bring back some food for me. You'd think he was asking for diamonds, with the fuss that was made! Considering we'd paid for full board, it shouldn't have been a big deal. After speaking to management. They agreed to let me have my meal in my room.Pools apart from one were freezing and I mean FREEZING!Free shuttle to the old town was only able to be used once. They failed to say that it picks up guests from other hotels first, so when it's reached maximum capacity that's it.The beach was lovely though and the children's club was okay."
Mar 2015,40,The caring and attentive staff made our week,"This hotel was everything you would expect from 5*, but it has to be said that the staff, particularly in the dining room, were absolutely wonderful. We had a full board package which included lunch and evening meal. The lunch menu was very varied and of an excellent standard, not a buffet, we chose off a menu. The sea bass, salmon, steak and chicken piri pirir were gorgeous, and always served with a genuine smile and desire that you enjoyed everything.The evening meal was a buffet, and whilst there wasnt a huge amount of choice, everything was hot and tasty. *Top Tip, book full board to get the best out of the food. Paulo Bento heads up the team in the dinning room and must be praised for his warm, natural style which radiated around the dining room and was adopted by all of his team. Rooms were spotless and spacious, and the location of the hotel could not be any better. A lovely walk on the beach every day, and a drink in the bar just through the gate on the way to the beach. No real entertainment to speak off while we were there, an odd singer or vioiln player, but mostly just a chilled, relaxing evening experience. Our only dissapointment was the indoor pool, as when we were there, the weather did not permit outdoor swimming. It was 20 Euros a person to use, which I thought a little steep if you just fancied an hour or so.If the cost had of been a little lower, im sure more people would use it. However, I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel for a weeks holiday where relaxation is what you are looking for."
Mar 2015,40,Although nice place to relax but would expect more from a 5 stars,"We staying in appartments which where nice, although we've been put near the road which tends to be a bit noisy. The beds where confortable, and the appartment spacious, but we would expect a bit more in terms of service for a 5 stars hotel, specially taking in account the rates.The breakfast was good and the service pleasant, but the pool bar was understaffed.The pool chairs was a bit on the short side and you needed to pay atention to manage to grab one."
Mar 2015,50,"Great hotel, perfect place to relax","Spent a week here with my partner and loved the hotel. We were fortunate with great weather in early March (early 20s) so happy just to lounge around the nice (heated) outdoor pool and beach. Beautiful setting, with lovely beach. Very good helpful staff."
Mar 2015,40,Great staff...but....,"We booked this hotel for a four night break. We had read positive reviews on Trip Advisor. Check in was fine, we were given hotel and resort information. We had booked a sea view room. This was on the third floor so we had good views. Breakfast was very good lots of choice from fresh fruit to a full cooked breakfast or freshly made omelettes.Things that weren't too good no tea & coffee making facilities in our room, which we kind of expect in five star hotels. The only available pool was the spa pool at 20 Euros each per use. Hence our swimming kit stayed in our cases.To finish on a positive all the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. Especially the the lady on reception who helped us with bus timetables for Silves and Villamoura. All in all a pleasant stay at this hotel."
Mar 2015,50,A grand way to spend time in Albufeira,"On the outskirts of the town located in a gated resort this hotel easily meets all the criteria for a five star rating but wears them very lightly.Right on the beach, with welcoming staff, great food and generously proportioned rooms all combine to create a perfect environment in which to relax and unwind.Our room on the ground floor had an ocean view and really ticked all the boxes and then some. Spa facilities are top class and there is a courtesy bus into town for those who can drag themselves away.Attention to detail is evident everywhere, even the guitar player in the lobby is seriously good.Highly recommended."
Mar 2015,40,Family trip in March,"Good quality hotel, strengths are  facilities, own sandy beach, free kids club and breakfasts,  shortcomings were locations (ten/fifteen minutes to bars / restuarants) , poor games room and limited on site dining facilities for families"
Mar 2015,50,excellent choice hotel,"We have just returned from short break at Grande Real, on arrival we  were told there was an issue  with our booking, after about fifteen minutes Catia  from customer relations came over to reassure us that all was fine and would be sorted as soon as possible, we were offered drinks, lunch anything that we required on the house. After about thirty minutes all was sorted out, Catia  dealt with the situation very professionally and never once did she say there was a problem which I found very reassuring. we were shown to our  room and WOW  it was fad, The location of the hotel is excellent right on the beach, The view from our room was so relaxing. All the staff are so well trained and willing to help with any queries such as bus times ,transfer pick up times (which really was not their remit) but all was sorted out with a smile.  Paulo and ALL the restaurant staff gave a First Class service nothing was too much trouble and always with a smile. The cleaning staff were always very friendly and their cleaning standards were very high. All in all a very well run hotel , we will return."
Mar 2015,50,Wow wow wow !!!,"Just back from a week at this hotel and cannot praise it highly enough.  The location is fab, right on the beach and the staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly.  We booked bed and breakfast and the food was heavenly, everything anyone could ever want.  We will definitely return."
Mar 2015,40,Family Trip to this Hotel,"We went for our annual holiday to this hotel, it is quite a smart hotel on the whole and the staff are very warm and friendly.   We were lucky to have the main suite in the hotel and it was beautiful - we had two bedrooms, a nice lounge, two bathrooms and a further toilet and a sumptuous dining room/kitchen.  This made our holiday to be fair.  We went full board and it was extremely good value for money.  The drinks like any other good hotel are not cheap but you get what you pay for really.  Breakfast was exceptionally good, lunch very good, evening meal was more than adequate.  As we went out of season (on purpose) it was quiet which suited us all.  Only one of the heated pools was accessible (but if you read the brochure this is what is said before you go out of season) and only the beach bar and the main restaurant available - again as expected so No nasty shocks there.  We did love our holiday at this hotel and the maid service is brilliant - because we had the Grand Real Suite - we were also delighted with a butler service twice a day for pastries and juice and ors h'oeuvres in the evening with wine either chilled white or carafe of red - this was complimentary - very very nice!  We would definitely go there again.  The only negative comments I have are: that the indoor heated pool which was never occupied during our stay was 20 Euros per person for one hour - we felt this was ridiculous - because on the overcast days in March - it would have been very expensive for us to use Daily - and as we never saw anybody in it out of season and it was empty - it serves nobody any purpose.  Also you have to buy compulsory caps of 3 Euros each too.  This is a shame - the Jacuzzis within this pool are not like conventional Jacuzzis either - water temperature is no different - and the steam room was broken.  The Spa which I visited probably one of the worst I have ever visited and I make a habit of checking out the spa's - I had what was called a spa pedicure - they didn't even have a foot spa it was a black bowl which you had to awkwardly try to stick your feet in whilst lying down which resulted in you doing a sort of visit to the gynae stance (not relaxing at all) in and she sort of wiped my feet with a cloth and that was the spa side done!!! The pedicure was the roughest and most painful one I have ever had in my life and the nail varnishes were cheap and nasty and chipped straight away - shame really as in this lovely hotel you expect wonderful and the spa pedicure was 55 Euros to boot!!!  We would definitely go back to the hotel and definitely have the same accommodation for sure but I wouldn't use the indoor pool and spa for sure - the gymn is free however.Our bed although decadent was very hard - I was fine but hubby tried to sleep on a pillow bless"
Mar 2015,50,A perfect spring break...,"My husband and myself recently stayed at the Grande Real to celebrate a special birthday for him.  We were not disappointed in any way.  Having arrived mid morning it was no problem to check in immediately, the staff were all very helpful and welcoming.  Our room had a beautiful sea front location and extremely comfortable.  The dining room was well set out with the drinks waiters quick to take orders, but most of all the food was very delicious for evening dining and breakfast, although we were happy that we'd paid for half board because there wasn't anywhere else much to eat in the evening and the price was a bit steep, we thought, at 32euros each. We found the hotel to be well run, professional but without pretension, so very comfortable.  I think that it's probably heading for a major refurbishment in the next couple of years but this didn't detract from it's comforts.The location was idyllic, in it's own little bay with a clean and lovely beach, although the beach was open to anyone too.  Also on site was a small shop for water, newspapers etc. and a lovely cafeteria for coffee, cake, ice cream and lunches.I would very much like to go back!"
Mar 2015,50,Great location,"We went as a couple for a relaxing weeks break from the cold of the UK. This hotel is in a lovely quiet location as stated in earlier reviews. It is an easy stroll though to excellent local bars and restaurants. The facilities at the hotel are first class. The breakfast buffet has a really good selection and caters for all tastes. Both hot and cold choices are extensive and fresh.Our room was really good. We had a lovely sea view and the room was spacious and kept nicely clean by the housekeeping team. The beds are really firm, however whilst there we saw lots of new mattresses being delivered so it would appear this minor issue is being addressed by the hotel.The main pool area was being renovated whilst we were there, however the hotel made sure disruption was kept to a minimum and the pool was still available with ample beds for the number of guests. Some upkeep is to be expected we find when visiting in low season and this caused us no problems at all.The hotel is lovely and relaxing and we wouldn't hesitate to return. We had a great time and all the staff are polite, helpful and attentive. The shuttle bus is really handy for getting into the old town. Though we enjoyed the walk into town as well. As it was lovely strolling in the sun and warmth. Plus there are some super bars and restaurants along the way to stop off, have some refreshment and watch the world go by.We would definitely recommend a visit and stay here if you are considering the Algarve for a break."
Mar 2015,50,Booked Again,"We have re-booked for a holiday in May, this hotel is fabulous, has all the facilities a family with young children require. This hotel is for people looking for a quiet and relaxing holiday- no loud noise, no busy traffic and no bars/clubs nearby. The food is very good. We ate both at the buffet and the a la carte menu and had no complaints. The alcoholic drinks are on the expensive side. The sea view restaurant /cafe is very good for snacks and coffee and the staff are very pleasant. Our 4 year old enjoyed every minute of it and the kids club staff were very nice and friendly and trustworthy. I felt very comfortable with our son playing in the playground and in the kids club. He wanted to stay there most of the time as well as in the heated pool. The staff all round could not have been any nicer. The Spa is brilliant and does exactly what you are looking for, really relaxing.  Roll on the next 8-9 weeks."
Mar 2015,40,Excellent service and location,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights last week.We wanted a short relaxing break with a bit of comfort,good food and good weather and were more than happy on all counts.The hotel is in an excellent location on the edge of Albufeira overlooking a good sandy beach which is easily accessible via steps. There are excellent facilites with extensive lounging areas round the outdoor pools as well as good seating areas on the balconies.As you go down to the b each there is the Atlantico bar and restaurant which does great value lunches. The variety and quality of the food at both breakfast and dinner(which for us was a buffet) was very good though the hot items at both were only lukewarm.The room was first class though our mattress was on the hard side of firm! The free bus service into the town was very handy with stops in both the old and new parts of the town.Customer service was outstanding throughout with all the staff being both professional and courteous-service with a smile goes a long way.We ate out on a couple of nights as there are several good value restaurants within 15 mins walk.Overall very impressed and no hesitation in recommending this hotel."
Mar 2015,30,"Lovely holiday, but not 5 star hotel","We have just returned from a lovely holiday in Portugal, the hotel seems very grand on first impressions, the reception area is very good, but when you get to room a lower standard completely,our room was a standard room with sea view, it was all very clean but a little worn, our bathroom basin was cracked, the bath chipped, the shower was basic and ok, air conditioning dreadful, beds very hard and noisy on any little movement, our patio door would not lock. Food was very expensive in restaurant, swimming pool 20 euros for one hour and compulsory swimming cap.Having said that the staff were very good and helpful, hotel clean, swimming pools outside good, we were out of season so not all restaurants open, but the pergola café really nice food and lovely views, staff lovely. the surrounding area good lots of restaurants and shops easy walking distance, the beach is beautiful, its a must to go Vilamoura harbour, excellent shops restaurants and cafes, its only 20minutes drive, well worth it. If you are into bowls there is a lovely little club in Vilamoura which welcomes visitors, Also if you like cliff top walks, make the journey to the west to Vila do Bispo to see the fort, only 3 euros and when you get through the gates what a surprise, beautiful walks and wildlife. We felt safe, all the locals friendly.We will definatley return to Portugal, but not this hotel."
Mar 2015,50,Excellent all the way,High quality throughout.  Great staff.  Great comforts.  Good attention to details.  Our suite was luxurious and the views were amazing.  Restaurant was very nice but not really good for young children and menu was too sophisticated.  Having said that the pizza was excellent and children can at least enjoy this or the chicken and chips option.
Mar 2015,50,"Five Star Hotel, Five Star Location, Five Star Rating!","Our group of 4 (2 couples) stayed at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort for 28 days - Feb 11 - March 11, 2015. It's about a 30 minute trip from Faro airport.We wanted somewhere to get away from the cold winter in Canada, but we got something pretty special at this hotel. Each couple had a one bedroom apartment, about a 4 minute walk to the maIn hotel lobby, restaurant, pool, beach etc. The apartments were very well equipped and enabled you to self-cater very easily. Full bathroom, separate bedroom, your own patio, etc. WIFI is free and available in the apartments but better reception in the main hotel lobby area.Staff were very friendly and helpful and really made a difference.A great resort hotel worthy of it's 5 star rating. One minor negative - 15 Euros each day to use the indoor pool made it too expensive. It's within the Spa area so I guess the hotel thinks customers will pay it, but they won't. We stayed outside and used the heated outdoor pool since it was sunny every day."
Mar 2015,50,Excellent hotel!,"Travelled as a couple and stayed in late August 2014.Hotel is beautiful. We arrived and had booked a self catering room but on arrival we were upgraded to a one bedroom apartment which was lovely and so much more space.The grounds are beautiful and always kept clean. Our room was right at the front entrance gate but were never kept awake with any traffic or cars coming in and out. The maids came in every day & gave us fresh towels & cleaned the room. The new town is a 15 minute walk but as I am lazy I preferred to get a taxi which sometimes was better off just walking - they phone you a taxi from reception and one night we waited 80 minutes (boyfriends wasn't impressed) they did however call us a minibus as it ended up a few guests waiting and a lovely Portuguese gentleman paid our fair for us (thank-you!)The hotel has its own private beach which on the second night my boyfriend surprised me and got down on one knee and proposed! (yeyy!) very memorable and romantic.We visited the spa one day which cost us 14 euros (if I remember right) for an hours use of the facilities which were sauna and the spa - they also give you a robe & hat to use too. We were the only people in and was very relaxing and calming.The new town is very lively and got clubs & pubs, we weren't into clubbing as a couple but was still a good night to watch everyone else. Only went into the old town one day never at night time.We also done jet ski's, swimming with dolphins and Para gliding which were all firsts for me!Over all was a fantastic holiday for me and was sad for it come to an end, will defiantly be visiting Portugal again in the future and would stay at the grande real again!"
Mar 2015,40,a quiet week,"we have just returned from a great week in this hotelthe bed was firm and the carpet had a couple of stains but overhaul this hotel was greatthe sea view was wonderful  and the staff fantastic. the free bus into town was good there was a gap returning on the afternoon in the times.the heated pool was good and the food was super. we had buffet breakfast but evening meal was waiter service and they were brilliant, It must have been the time of the year the hotel was very quiet which was great for us The drinks prices were usual hotel pricesand the beach bar was ideal for a snack at lunch time, security was good and nothing was a problem for the staff. We didn't use the spa, and there was some entertainment on a couple of nights but it was more background music , so if its night life your looking for you will have to go into town. the nearest shops and bars were some ten minutes walk away and most people seemed to have a hire car. we will be back thanks Derek and Pat from Teesside"
Mar 2015,50,"5* - Superb Hotel, Location and Staff","I have just come back from spending 5 nights at the Grande Real and one of the best holidays that I have had.  I wanted somewhere to relax and recharge my batteries and this was the ideal place. I booked half board, being on my own as didn't really want to venture out of the hotel much. I was fortunate to have fantastic weather. The room - I booked a classic sea view single with balcony. Sea View is a must at this hotel, it is stunning and you get the sun on your balcony all day and the view of the resort, beach and ocean is breath-taking. My room was amazing, it had a super king size bed, satellite TV that got SKY news and there was another channel that showed films, you can also buy some films to watch.  There is a mini-bar which you can get filled, if you want or you can put your own things in there. But it is not refrigerated, it is more like a larder, will keep things cooler than being left out of it, but not as cold I would like water (or wine)to be. Lots of wardrobe space, spacious bathroom and a safe, which is free to use.  I did request a mattress topper before I arrived as I had heard the beds were quite hard, and this was in place and very comfortable. The Real Restaurant was the only restaurant open and served a buffet breakfast between 7am and 10.30am.  The choice was extensive and lovely.  For dinner I was given vouchers to use in the restaurant and could choose from the al la carte menu and have three courses, which made my stay excellent value for money. The food was gorgeous and there is an extensive choice. The staff in the restaurant were lovely, friendly and very attentive. The Hotel Bar - open from 9am - 1am, was very quiet. I had lunch a couple of times here and the service and food was excellent. Not to mention the after eight cocktail I enjoyed after dinner each evening. There was a couple of evenings when there was entertainment. But is still very early in the season.The Pools - there are three pools, one children's pool and two larger pools,  beware the one near the pool bar is heated, the other one is not!!  Plenty of space on the loungers, but again, it was quiet. Not sure it will be like that in peak season. The Spa - the spa is gorgeous and I treated myself to  Basil Massage which was on special offer and it was amazing. I believe that it costs 20 Euros for the pool in their and you need a swimming cap.Location - the hotel is pretty isolated, but if you need a supermarket, for just little bits, there is one five minutes walk turning right outside the complex and it is on the left in another apartment complex.  Or if you turn left out of the hotel it is 10-15 minute walk to bars and restaurants. There is a shuttle bus that takes you into Albufeira old town and the strip, the old town is definitely worth a visit, but not for the faint hearted if the escalators back up to get the bus back are not working.. but you can get a Taxi which is about 7 Euro either way.There is direct access to the beach and the Atlantico cafe bar, which is great for lunchtime snacks. Some people have said that it is expensive and it is all relative to me, in that, yes it is expensive if compare against bars and restaurants in the town, but compare against a 4 or 5* hotel over here, very reasonable. I would pay more for a glass of wine in Manchester than I did there.If you want 5* accommodation, 5* service, isolation, peace, quiet and relation with stunning views, then this is the place to go, I am sure if will get busier as the season goes on and I will definitely be back later in the year."
Mar 2015,50,Really helpful reservations team,I have booked a surprise for the family and the team at reservations have been very helpful to ensure the best few days for us all.  We are looking forward to visiting because if the rest of the staff team at the hotel are as kind as Teresa we will have a great time.Many Thanks
Mar 2015,40,Relaxing holiday,Good pointsLocation on the beach. Sea view room a must! Room 219 lovely view close to lift.Rooms spacious and kept clean.Spa very nice.However 20 euro charge too expensive. If cheaper would have used every day. An ' English ' thing but no tea facilities in room. Take a travel kettle if it's important to you as it is to me!I personally found the beds very hard but wasn't much of a problem for my husband.Food nice and varied. Unfortunately some of the meals weren't very warm because left on a hot plate .Overall a very nice hotel but I think it should be noted that it is a European 5*.Would recommend to friends and family.
Mar 2015,40,"great hotel, not the best location","the hotel was lovely, can't fault it but the area around the hotel was a real disappointment.  If you like to get out of the hotel and walk around to nice little authentic restaurants this isn't for you!"
Feb 2015,50,Unbelievable Bargain!,"My Partner and i fancied a budget Febuary warm up as we always do this time of year  so arranged for 4 nights half board with sea view room at a unbelievable price via Blue Sea Hols keeping our fingers crossed for some good weather.Having been to the Algarve on 3 previous occasions with  varied levels of comfort I can say that the Grande Real is a genuine 4 star hotel very well maintained with professional staff and fantastic beach front location. The Sea view room was as good as it gets and with settled weather of around 18c, clear and sunny we pretty much hit the jackpot here.The breakfasts were plentiful (my partner loved the free prosseco) and the buffet dinners better than expected. The Hotel has an indoor pool & Spa (although we never used it) and large indoor and outdoor terraces to take in the fine views. Also a free shuttle to Albufeira Old Town (10 mins away) which was a nice touch.Due to low residency on our last night they changed from Buffet to Al a Carte menu and we had probably one of the best meals we have had in the Algarve ,Clams and Seafood Cataplana etc. (Although they need to drop the best of Phil Collins Cd on continuous replay....)All in all a wonderfully relaxing break walking the cliffs and beaches eating fantastic seafood and drinking good Potuguese wines.Highly recommended. I am sure we will return!"
Feb 2015,50,Fantastic 4 night break !,"We have just returned from a fantastic four night break at this lovely hotel.  We stayed in a studio apartment which was well equipped and spotlessly clean !  The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly, can't do enough for you. This was a surprise trip for my birthday from my partner and on the day the hotel sent over champagne and a birthday cake to our apartment !, lovely gesture :)  The hotel has it's own private beach and lovely grounds, water features etc. We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on the food/drink etc.  The old town is quite a walk away (easier going into town than coming back due to the large hill !) but a taxi from the hotel to the old town square was around 7 euros.  There are shops/restaurants/bars etc just 5-10 minutes away turning left out of the front of the hotel.  We would recommend Ranni's restaurant in this area... good food, good atmosphere and superb staff !  There are only a couple of little niggles.  The beds, they are hard, this didn't really bother us... but the zip connecting the two mattresses in the middle was a real pain, very uncomfortable !  It woke me most nights having fallen asleep on it :(  Ask for the mattress toppers when booking, I'm sure this would solve the bed problems.  Although the kitchenettes are well equipped with pots, pans etc.. there was no washing up materials and no salt/pepper etc... I'm sure these could be provided without too much expense.  All in all we had a great holiday for our first time to Portugal and we would certainly look at staying here again !"
Feb 2015,50,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at this beautiful hotel from 15th - 22nd February, my hubster and 13 year old daughter.  We had a fabulous room with 2 separate bedrooms, our daughter had her own bathroom, tv, balcony etc so she could have some peace and quiet from us!!!!  Our rooms were carpeted which reduced any noise above us with shoes/chairs etc.The hotel staff were all fabulous, so helpful and courteous and could not do enough for us.  We never came across one bad staff member.The food was buffet style for breakfast and evening meal and although there was plenty of choice, I am not a massive fan of buffets but bearing in mind the distance from the hotel to the restaurants, we were glad we chose half board otherwise it would have been a taxi ride each evening.  You could however choose a la carte in the restaurant or the buffet I think and there were some great bar snacks in the bar, but not sure what time they stopped serving food in the bar area.The downside for us as a family was the SPA.  It was 20 euros each for anyone over 16 for 1.5 hours.  Our daughter was not allowed to go in as she was only 13.  A few of the hydro machines weren't working when I went in and I don't think it was worth the 20 euros.  My hubby and I used the gym and it was good but I got into trouble for filling my water bottle up going out of the gym as I was naturally thirsty and hot - I was asked to use one of the plastic cups instead as apparently hotel guests were filling up their water bottles for use in their rooms!!!!!!!!!!! I found this slightly offensive, but the staff member did approach it in a nice way!I had a full body massage one day, but it was nothing to write home about - 95 euros, with a 25 euro discount I think.  Again it wasn't the most pleasant of experiences.  Overall I would recommend this hotel but not sure if we would return as we prefer Vilamoura and there is a great 5 star hotel there where you can take your children into the spa for 10 euros per day if over 12 years - a great bonus for us as a family if the weather isn't too great.We met some lovely people at the hotel and we have very fond memories of our week at the Grande Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa."
Feb 2015,30,Good,Beautiful hotel. Restaurant food was exquisite and staff were lovely. Balconies had a good view but were relatively small. Pools were small too. Brilliant location if you want to spend time on the beach as the hotel is very close (you can even hear the waves with the balcony doors open). Outside of albuferia but the shuttle bus was handy. Nice hotel overall but it can be very quiet. Perfect for a weekend getaway
Feb 2015,50,Another fantastic stay,"We have just enjoyed our second stay at this lovely hotel. We stayed from  3rd February to 10th February.  We enjoyed our stay just as much as last year.  Once again, we have had an excellent, wonderful holiday.  All the staff at the hotel are exceptional,very hardworking, friendly and helpful.  As a surprise on our wedding anniversary the hotel gave us complimentary wine on ice and traditional Portuguese cakes and chocolate strawberries. The room we were in had a sea view (which is a must) The food was excellent and the service in the restaurant is outstanding.  There was entertainment in the bar one evening, which was a lady violist and singer.  She was also very good, though it's a pity more people weren't in the bar to enjoy it.  We will be back again!"
Feb 2015,50,Absolutely brilliant,Had a week stay at hotel absolutely brilliant staff very attentive very clean food lots of choice and fantastic would go back again lovely waking up to sea view own private beach had a lovely walk across cliffs to old town
Feb 2015,50,Highly recommended,"Best hotel for a family with young children (Free kids club with lots of activities). The view from the bar and swimming pool was breathtaking. Free shuttle bus to go shops (scheduled Monday-Friday).  Our 2 bedroom apartment was always kept clean, fresh towels everyday. Service was very good. We would definitely come back. :-)"
Feb 2015,50,Fab break ,Had a fab 5 night break here   The hotel is modern and luxurious. The staff are friendly and attentive  our sea view room wasn't quite ready when we arrived and by way of apology the reception staff sent up a lovely champagne tea with delicious cakes which was a lovely touch   Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Beds firm but comfyWas surprised no tea/ coffee making facilities in the room which is a little unusual for 5* hotel. But a kettle was sent up upon request Spa and gym area were lovely  but be warned there is a €20 charge for the pool for an hour and €10 for compulsory swimming hat which I thought a little steep Breakfast is excellent   Lots of choice.  Had dinner at hotel once.  Very nice but quite expensive.  I recommend eating out. If you leave resort and turn left there a loads of great eating places a 20 min walk away or 5 min drive   Recommend a car as hotel is fairly isolated although there is a free shuttle bus which goes into  Albufeira 4 times a day Thoroughly enjoyed the holiday and would def recommend is for an out of season break in the sun    Would definitely come back
Feb 2015,50,One of the best.,"The first time we visited, was for a cocktail and enjoying the spumante, the tapas and the nice and location, we knew that we one day wanted to stay overnight.  The hotel is modern and well entertained and this was one reason more.For Valetines day, so we did. Got a vip treatment by arrival, room upgrade for free, a delicious dinner , a helpfull staff and by breakfast sparkling wine like in some other hotels. This one was maybe the best.Every cliente has his ownopinion about the beds.  One likes hard, others like it soft..The rooms are confortable with full carpet. No noise from the shoes above.For sure, we wait the next occasion to reeturn  for a relaxing short holiday, even if we live only 25 km inside the country."
Feb 2015,50,Better than we expected....,"We selected this hotel because of a number of reasons: it was close to a par 3 golf course, could walk to it; it had its own beach area; it had a shuttle bus to the town centre of Albufeira.  The one bedroom apartment was as shown on the website which is not usually the case.  We did find the hotel restaurants expensive and not up to expectations but there are many outside options available within a short walk so it was not a problem.  The staff were great and we were more than satisfied with the service."
Feb 2015,40,"Very Good Hotel, Fantastic location, but.","The Hotel is located right on the Atlantic coast and has fantastic views with a great beach.  However, it is rather isolated being a tough 15-20 minute walk from any shops, restaurants, bars etc. The staff are excellent, friendly and keen to please.  Rooms are good, comfortable and clean.  The one big down side is the lack of good, reasonably priced food and drink.  Whilst I was there only the main restaurant on the lower floor below reception was open.  The buffet breakfast here was passable with a very good selection of 'continental' style fruit, cold meats, bread, etc.  The Hot choices were not so good, standard air-dried bacon and tiny sausages, however, there were eggs - fried, boiled or scrambled.  The real disappointment came in the evening, whilst the A la Carte was good it was a very limited menu and expensive.  The only other choice was the 'buffet' which in all honesty was appalling and at 32 Euro very over-priced.  Drinks in the bar were expensive, a large beer costing 4.50 Euro compared with only 2 Euro in town.  Having said all this I would recommend the Hotel, but advise you to ensure you arrange transport so that you can escape in the evenings for food and drink."
Feb 2015,50,"""well needed holiday""","Fantastic hotel and wonderful staff. After reading the reviews about how uncomfy the beds were, were advised to ask for bed toppers which I did and had a better night sleep than I do at home. Room cleaned every Day by wonderful happy cleaning staff. Would definitely recommend. There  with my 13year old daughter as her School broke up the week before most other schools so got a 5star hotel for the price of a 3star. It definitely is a 5star hotel with a beautiful sea view room..."
Feb 2015,50,Fantastic birthday treat,"We have just returned from a fantastic 4nights break at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Hotel and Spa .This was a Birthday treat for my husband's 65th birthday ,and he couldn't have had a better place to celebrate it .The management arranged a lovely surprise for him on the actual day, a bottle of bubbly and a lovely birthday cake was sent to our room, he was totally gob smacked and truly surprised .So I would like to say a very big thank you for making my husband's birthday a memorable one .I would also like to say what a fabulous hotel this is  can not fault it in any way everything about it is great , food ,service,facilities ,friendliness,location,accomadation.I would certainly recommend this Hotel to any one it is first class.Myself and my husband will certainly be making a return visit ."
Feb 2015,50,birthday  treat.,"My   wife   booked   the   4 day   break   at  the   Grande Real Santa  Eulalia  Resort  Hotelfor   my  65th  birthday.We   were   shown   our  room  by  very  nice  porter  asked  us  were  we happy  with  ourroom  which  was   very   nice  but  at  the  rear  of  hotel  we  said  could  we have a sea  view  he   said  he  would  check for us  which he  did  and  came  back and   said  that  we  could have  sea  view  for 20 euros  a  day  we  agreed  the  view  was  great .As    was   the  hotel   we   only   book  bb  but  we  ate  at  the  restaurant  the  food  was  excellent, service  first  class I   can   fully   recommend this  hotel  5star  hotel  that  is  justified ."
Jan 2015,30,Sentenced to 7 nights hard labour breaking rocks in bed.,"Its 2:30 am, not best time to write a review, seeing as I can't goddamm sleep I am feeling a tad restless. 5* hotel let down by the simple fact that i would be more comfortable sleeping in the pristine lobby, or on the cobbled driveway in the ""resort view"" car park.  It's even making me forget that ( normally my most hated hotel crime, shows how bad these beds are) I cannot be trusted to regulate my own bladder and must have a plastic diaper on my bed Oh have started to moan, so ;WiFi just because its free shouldn't mean its crap.No kettle in room unless you ask, however you must order room service to get cups?Gym, 1 pedal on a stationary bike is not useful.Closing Gym at 8pm.Pictures of gym making out twice as big, MIRRORS!£20 to use indoor pool?1 man and a Hammond organ is not top class entertainment.Can you use softener on the towelling? I don't want to exfoliate after a shower.Vinegar in poached eggs, as my nonna says, why?Out of date activity sheets have you not realised its a new week?Don't come in round the back, press the "" please press here"" labeled button, as a"" you can't get in this way go ALL the way round the back""  is annoying. And if I had been asleep you know what, I wouldn't have written all this. NEW NICER BEDS PLEASE Can you ask cleaners not to remove the spare duvet off room 238s, bed as he is sleeping on it.On the positive side,views, breakfast, location, and staff, especially the cheerfully young lad in the bar. Will add his name.Taking me 3 attempts to load this page so if your in the Hotel lobby and see a naked grumpy hairy man hands upraised to the gods of WiFi router, I apologise."
Jan 2015,40,Very good and close to excellent,"Firstly let me say this is a quality establishment. You cannot help but be impressed with the facilities, We went as 2 couples; one in the main hotel in a classic sea view room, the other in a 1bed apartment. Perfect arrangement for us as we could use the balcony in the hotel room for sitting out early evening and enjoying the wonderful view, use the well equipped apartment for dining when we decided to self cater. We were there on a B&B basis and didn't use the hotel for evening dinner. What I can say is that the breakfasts are wonderful. In the past 10 years our best breakfasts were in Prague at a particular favourite hotel of ours, but we have now found No.2. Juices, fruit, cheeses, meats, excellent quality in everything. Staff service, cleanliness, all of a high standard. Of course not everything was perfect. A few points to disappoint us i) we had mistakenly believed there was an indoor pool; important for us when we book Portugal in January. There is no residents pool, a spa which charges you everyday it is used. Can the hotel not accommodate residents better although possibly less critical in the summer.That was not to our liking. However, overall to be recommended."
Jan 2015,40,Lovely apartments cold pools,I am a late reviewer we stayed here 20th May for one week.  We had a lovely one bed apartment with the children in lounge on double and single sofa bed.  There was a pool right outside our apartment but unfortunately it was very cold.  The main pool at the back of reception was heated but small and very busy.  It was not possible to swim in this pool as full of children. The bar in the hotel is very expensive. the staff are all very friendly and cannot do enough to make sure your having a pleasant stay.  There was also a bar at our pool by apartments but this was not open due to time of year.  Didn't really experience entertainment at hotel as went out most evenings.  If you come out of hotel and turn left the restaurant is very good and we ate there several times.  The beach snack bar was much cheaper than the hotel bar and was good for toasties etc..This was a lovely hotel and I think later in the year when hot enough to swim in outdoor pools would be wonderful. A larger heated outdoor pool is in order I think for the size of the hotel
Jan 2015,50,Theraputic and excellence all round,"You will travel afar before you will come across a hotel like the Grande Saint Eulalia. It is a most beautiful hotel; on arrival I was greeted with wide open space and a beautiful view of the ocean what a welcome; following this the staff at reception were exceptional.  They were wonderful at all times with my queries; they could not have been more helpful and  professional. Their knowledge of all things great and small is to be commended.  I must also say that booking this hotel with their reservations office was indeed a very good experience made easy by the gracious and patient expertise of the personel.  My room was truly all you could ask for with again a beautiful view onto the ocean.  The room was  most inviting in decor and size It was spotless and exceptionally well kept for the week.  As I looked out there was my own private beach!! for the hotel residents what a special treat morning, noon or night. This is all about location, location,location.  I felt incredibly safe at the Sainte EulaliaAs for the exquisite dining what can I add.  Breakfast was exceptional in all that was on offer.  There was elegance in the presentation and in the welcome of the staff. Fine dining for breakfast is what I experienced  what  a delightful start to the day.  In the evening dinner was really delicious; so well presented both by the chef and the waiting personnel. I have already decided that I am returning.  Added to all the above they offer a complimentary return shuttle bus to the old town of Albufeira at different times in the dayA truly memorable and healing experience. Multo obrigado to everyone"
Jan 2015,50,Fantastic Christmas break,"Had an amazing stay at this lovely hotel between Christmas and New Year 2014with my daughter.  Beautiful location with a stunning beach, the hotel was incredible, great food, comfortable and clean room with friendly and helpful staff.  Would definitely come back again."
Jan 2015,50,Quality 5 star hotel.,Great hotel.Had our wedding here. Can't fault it. Stunning views of the beach and the surrounding coastline. Food is great. Hotel looks fantastic. Plenty of places to eat and drink. Staff are so friendly and helpful. Will be back.
Jan 2015,50,Great family holiday,"We had a great family holiday here last June, hotel staff were great and the hotel room is lovely,  beach and pools are great, our kids loved it and we'll be going back again this summer for the third year in a row."
Jan 2015,50,Grande and Real 5 Star ***** Experience,"Jorge Teixeira - Hotel Manager, thank you so much for being a true professional and ensuring that we had a great visit at The 5 Star Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and Spa Hotel in Albufeira, Portugal.We returned home today 5th January 2015 from a 9 night, 10 day stay at the hotel.Reuben checked us in quickly and with a smile whilst informing of the many facilities available to us and we were then driven to our upgraded 2 bedroomed apartment in one of the resorts' buggies. During a later stage of our visit, Reuben also spoke to a company off-site for us, as they could not speak English and our Portuguese is limited.The apartment consisted of 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms (one with a Jacuzzi) and ample towels, a leisure seating area, 6 seated dining area, a kitchenette, and a balcony. The utensil provided were of a high quality.The maids would set out the dining table with table cloth, in preparation for any meals we chose to have. The apartment was spacious and spotless. Bathrobes were provided and slippers were the most comfortable hotel slippers I have ever worn (I have had many).Marisa, a staff member at the front desk was extremely helpful and efficient - every request or question she was asked, she actioned this with perfection and speed. Thank you Marisa - keep showing that wonderful smile.Jorge Teixeira was also kind enough to provide us with complimentary Gold Package Spa Memberships for the duration of our stay. Many thanks Jorge.There was a fabulous New Years Eve Black Tie Red Carpet Gala at the hotel which we did not attend as we had previously made other arrangements. However, we thoroughly enjoyed the amazing midnight fireworks provided at the hotel.We hired a dedicated driver who took us all over the Algarve including The Algarve Mall, restaurants, and other shopping trips at our leisure.The attention to detail was excellent. Late checkout was also appreciated.Jorge Teixeira, it was a pleasure communicating with you leading up to our break at The Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and Hotel Spa. Your hotel is like 'a home from home'.We cant thank you enough for your major, if not sole input into making this a pleasurable and memorable time in Albufeira, Portugal.Angela and Richard"
Jan 2015,50,fab hotel,"We've just returned from a weeks stay at this hotel & can honestly say it was all we expected having stayed here just after it opened.We stayed on a bed & breakfast basis with plenty of choice, New Years Eve firework display was fantastic. The staff are helpful & very friendly."
Jan 2015,40,Overall a good holiday,I stayed at this hotel resort with my girlfriend for 5 nights (Dec 27th - Jan 1st). The highlight of the holiday was actually spending a day in Seville which was breathtaking. Make sure you use the tour weekly planner. We didn't visit Lisbon which was disappointing which was a hotel error. Old town was amazing. Algarve shopping was just like Birmingham Bullring. The hotel staff (most of them) were friendly. We had half board. Spa treatment weren't great. Plus it's expensive. Apartment (402) was clean. A few hiccups with the TV and Wifi but nonetheless a great stay. Will definitely return in 2015.
Jan 2015,50,Still here Jan 1st in the sunshine,"I was worried whether this hotel would live up to standards at 5 star I would say we as a family of 4 with two teenagers aged 17 and 14 have had a lovely time. The concert on the beach in the old town for new year was amazing last night but back to the hotel. I cannot fault the staff and I mean every single one they are so polite and helpful. Our Jacuzzi bath didn't work they offered to change room but we couldn't be bothered to pack four cases so without us asking they left a bottle of red wine water and two packets of smarties in our room how lovely. Some would argue that's how it should be but I have been to enough hotels to know this does not happen!! The two bed appartment is amazing huge! They even put mattress toppers on the beds which I had requested by email. Again this doesn't always happen at hotels. Free WiFi in our room and all over the hotel so kids very impressed that's 5 stars! Cannot fault the cleaning staff lovely ladies.  Cannot fault reception or restaurant staff. Cannot fault the spa staff treatments are lovely, the gym good but havent been in the hyrda pool because 80 euros for a family is a bit much but might try today. All the above 5 star. Food I would honestly say is a 4 star. It's a bit repetitive, often luke warm but we have enjoyed it and as a meat eater family there has been steak lamb chicken ginea fowl so a good 4 star. The kids have even got up for breakfast so it must be good they usually skip it and sleep in. Location beach lovely the hotel could do with a shop rather than boutique but everything within walking distance. Overall even with the food maybe 4 star I would and have given excellent in the review a really lovely stay with lovely staff and sunshine every day for 5 days in December and the kids haven't moaned once what more can I ask for thank you to everyone at Grande real."
Dec 2014,50,Another excellent stay,"Travelled over October half term for a 4 night break very lucky as the weather was very warm, found the hotel up its usual high standards breakfast, lunch (atlantico cafe), dinner all very good. Excellent service by all the staff. During my stay it was my birthday and reception sent me a complimentary  bottle of sparkling wine and birthday cake which was a very nice gesture. Out of all the hotels we have stayed in this is the most relaxing hotel we have visited and shall be returning again next year for what will be our tenth stay"
Dec 2014,50,FANTASTIC!!,"I stayed at this hotel on the 1st December for 4 nights, the staff were fantastic and could not enough for us! The hotel was spotless! Rooms were always clean. we stayed in a suite which was huge and bigger than we needed to 2 of us. The view over the sea was fantastic and we even seen dolphins swimming past from our balcony. The bar/cafe by the beach was wonderful and had some fantastic views. The beach was very quiet and private which we really enjoyed and spent a lot of time there. Location is good - 15 minute walk down the road and you are by all the bars and restaurants. If you wanted to get a taxi into Albuferia Old Town or New its is around 7 euros which was not bad at all - however they shuttle does run from the hotel regular which was a nice touch and very convenient. The lady at reception recommended the gypsy markets to us which we visited - defiantly worth a visit as they are fantastic! very cheap and you do not get hassled at all! I would like to say thanks to all the staff at this hotel for such a wonderful stay and i will defiantly be back next year! This hotel was fantastic and defiantly worth visit. As i am in travel myself i will also be recommending this hotel to all my customer wanting to visit the Algarve,"
Dec 2014,50,great resort,"Only stayed here for 4 days during the WKC World Championships, but we were surprised and hapy with the level of accomodation, breakfast and service. Had a fantastic week. We only had bed and breakfast and did not eat inside the hotel. So unable to comment on the lunch and dinner."
Nov 2014,40,Great place for a out of season break,"Well presented resort visited end November 2014. Stayed in Studio apartment. Very spacious. Clean, well cared for, plenty of towels & clean bedding daily, unfortunately bed rather solid although very large (6 feet) Heating worked well and quickly important for winter break. Wifi good too. Next to small beach which was nice. Hotel had outdoor heated pool to 28c which we did not sample, but indoor pool use appears to count as 'spa treatment' and was prohibitively expensive. A shame because didn't seem to be used at all. Did not sample meals at resturant as these seemed very expensive too compared to food prices in the town.Generally good place, would go againA little too far to walk to Albufeira, though plenty of shops & resturants etc within walking distant (even better than in town)"
Nov 2014,20,Lack of response from hotel,"My wife and I were due to join our family at the hotel on 27 July for one week.  Unfortunately I was unable to travel due to illness although I persuaded my wife to travel without me.  I submitted a claim to my insurers about the loss of my holiday and I was asked to obtain a letter of ""No show"" from the hotel.  Despite two email requests and one letter by post I have had no response at all from the hotel.  So although my wife had a lovely holiday with the family the hotel reputation is not helped by the inability to respond to a simple request"
Nov 2014,30,Noisy and colours in apartment were jarring.,"Noise carries badly, if you are noise sensitive, beware.  Why do woman in their rooms clip clop in high heels all day and night?Alarms went off.  No one interested, said it was normal,  Toilet never worked and staff seemed disinterested.Towels in rooms very thin.Good points, the cafe by the beach is lovely.  The beach itself is 5 star the rest of the resort is not."
Nov 2014,50,"Lovely hotel, lovely staff","Booked this hotel for a girls few days away, bedroom beautiful overlooking the sea, arrived in late on Sunday evening and went to the restaurant - got great  service as we were the only ones there! The salmon was fabulous served with rice, we  did not get to sit on as they were closing (it was 11pm by the time we had finished).  Got up next day it was pouring with rain, the receptionist organised a car to take us touring, for €70 we had the driver at our disposal all day, he was our own little tour guide and took us shopping and the the markets further up the coast.    The next day we got up for breakfast but found their cooked breakfast a little disappointing as it was cooked and warm but would have preferred to have the eggs cooked fresh like most 5 star hotels have - there were lots of lovey breads (if you eat bread that is fine), service was good and had lots of hot tea and coffee.  The pool area is lovely and the beach in front of the hotel is a short walk away.  The bar in the hotel is lovely and relaxing where you can enjoy hot drinks, cocktails, wine, beer etc, the staff were very friendly also.   the beds were really comfy and the rooms very spacious and well laid out, a bottle of water was provided on the first night but was not replenished however you could have it supplied at a charge.  I left some clothing behind in the wardrobe and called the hotel on my return home , they located the clothing in the room and they posted it to me free of charge!  A lovey experience and will definitely be back, my friends stayed in the apartments which would be suitable for families with a bedroom with twin beds and 2 beds in the living kitchen area.   Highly recommended."
Nov 2014,50,perfect location and a great getaway,"Location is perfect - beachfront access and 5 pools to choose from (one heated outdoor, and one indoor in the spa) great breakfast and rooms and hotel spotlessly clean. Kids Club is great as is their staff and their restaurants are very good - the drinks prices are affordable for a hotel though much cheaper in bars and plenty of very good restaurants nearby (Martin's is just by the entrance and is superb excellent value for money and Casa Velha for traditional cuisine) The hotel is a wonderful relaxing environment - we have been 3 times in the last few years for a week to recharge our 'batteries' and we never want to leave - I won't go into details but they have been consistent in quality, service, cleanliness over those three visits and some very nice touches like cake and champagne on your birthday.Lots to see and do in the area - make this your base and a great place to get back to when you've had a busy day out watching the sun set over the beach..."
Nov 2014,40,Not disappointed,"First time at this hotel, stayed for a long weekend on half board. Comments are based on experience at what is a quiet time of the year when the hotel is no more that a quarter full. Large hotel and apartment complex set in own well maintained grounds with easy access to an excellent beach immediately to the rear. Very large reception area, staff were very friendly. Bedroom was fine as was bathroom....water is very hot, very large double bed...........with a firm mattress. Rooms made up daily with fresh towels as required. Breakfast and dinner both buffet style, fine selection and plentiful (a la carte dinner available but to be honest I thought the buffet was better). Nice dining room with sea view. I do often wonder why a free jug/bottle of water is not provided at dinner time when free bottled water....and champagne is provided at breakfast. Atlantico cafe which overlooks the beach and is part of the complex provides excellent lunchtime snacks, competitively priced. Outside pools, one heated, with plenty of sunbeds...towels provided. There is a very good indoor spa pool with sauna and steam room...it does cost €15 per person per use and bathing caps need to be worn...can be purchased €3....bathrobe, towels and slippers are provided, well worth using even if only as a one off. Free WiFi worked well and there are free use PCs available. There is a regular free bus service to Albafeira...it is also walk-able for the energetic. Taxis are cheap and plentiful. Would happily stay at this hotel again....although we tend to like trying other top end hotels in this part of the Algarve for our weekend breaks."
Nov 2014,40,Perfect location and decent food,"This is a great resort with beachfront access and wonderful food. The staff are very helpful and polite, and always available. I would strongly suggest this hotel, especially as it offers a shuttle into town, which means you have the benefit of a lovely resort but the access into town without having a car. Strongly reccomend this hotel over any others that are poorly located. Beds were a little firm though."
Nov 2014,50,Lovely Hotel,"We recently had a short stay here to meet up with friends. It is a lovely hotel, the staff are all very helpful and polite. The food was fresh with a vast choice on offer both at the evening meal and breakfast. The bar drinks are expensive , I was a little cross at the fact of a price difference between the main bar and the restaurant, the cheapest bottle of red wine on offer in the bar was €26 but in the restaurant they charged us €14. in fairness the wine was of a different grape and actually the cheaper restaurant wine  was by far a nicer wine ! We enjoyed our short  stay and have already booked for a longer stay next year."
Nov 2014,20,15EURO EXTRA PER DAY FOR INDOOR POOL OR GYM,I stayed here recently and while the hotel is exactly what u expected for the price range i.e. a 4star dressed up as a 5star....i did not expect the indoor pool to be 15 EURO PER HOUR PER PERSON....i looked on booking.com and ebookers prior to booking and it mentions nowhere that if you want all the services it'll cost an extra couple on hundred quidApart from that though its quite nice for a 4star but no where near a 5 star
Nov 2014,40,Nice Hotel but not 5 star,"Stayed here last month and overall it was fine but felt that there were some things let the Hotel down. The tables in the dining room only had a space of about six inches between you and the people next to you - you were even expected to share the salt and pepper as the tables were so close!  We were half board and the breakfast and dinner were a free for all at the serve yourself buffet. The food was ok but nothing special and some of the waiters made you feel as if you were an inconvenience though the majority were friendly and helpful. The sofas and chairs in the bars and the foyer while they looked stylish were really uncomfortable and didn't make you want to sit very long. We were also very disappointed that there was only entertainment provided on one night during our seven night stay. On the plus side the reception staff were very helpful and efficient, our sea view room was lovely and towels etc were changed regularly, and instead of going to the main pool are at the Hotel we went to one of the pools provided for the residents of the apartments and the largest number of people who were there at the same time as us was 8 which was absolute heaven!  We went into Albufeira old town a few times during our holiday and it was between 6 and 8 euros for a taxi depending on traffic which we thought was very reasonable. Enjoyed our holiday but feel the Hotel is 4star not 5."
Nov 2014,40,A Do-Nothing short break,"We had five nights in a self catering apartment that was very well equipped. A massive bed, very comfortable, great shower and a bath. Verandah leading down to a pool. Hotel restaurant was a bit ordinary but a local restaurant within five minutes walk was excellent value and quality local food. Beach was very clean of course and again within five minutes walk of our apartment. Easy reach (40mins) from the airport. Courtesy bus into the nearest town ran there and back four times a day. Local supermarket close by and an ""Intermarche"" about fifteen minutes walk provided everything we needed for breakfast and each morning and a couple of evening meals."
Nov 2014,50,Good 4 night stay good value,"Went to this hotel last week for a four night break!Hotel is lovely room could perhaps do with a little TLC lovely big room very clean huge bathroom but could maybe do with updating little refurb maybe! Breakfast in the hotel is just amazing, and we only paid £62 a night! Pool areas lovely, lovely complex, we found the old town a beautiful place to go at this time of year it was busy enough but not rammed however peak season think this area is extremely busy to the pint of large queues for taxis to get back! We taxi to and from the old town each day costing around 6/7 euros a trip!Gym facility in hotel was used and was great! It was helped by the in usually great weather they was having!All in all great trip!"
Nov 2014,40,returned on the 26th october after one week,"great hotel, great location on the beach, staff were excellent, rooms very good we had a one bed apartment on the ground flooron the down side nearest shops and bars 20min walk awaythe food in the restaurant while of good quality was always stone cold no one seemed to be bothered on our last day we were waiting for the doors to open at 7.00am so were first in but surprise surprise egg etc was cold from the starton the plus side the hotel beach bar food was cooked fresh and always very goodno entertainment in the evening not even piped music to the outside bar area"
Nov 2014,50,Outstanding value for money,"Loved it. Super staff, great breakfast buffet, child friendly pool, plush comfortable room, accessible beach. Booked again for May. Book it if you can. Seriously. You won't regret it. Arrived before 11am and was by the pool on one of the plentiful dinners by 11:30am. Amazing value for money."
Nov 2014,40,Lovely complex,"We visited this resort for the forst time during the October half term break and as we were taking my Mother in Law booked a 2 bed room apartment.The apartment was spotless although a little tired in places, eg the bath needed replacing or repair and the fridge door was broken. However, the cleaning staff visited every day and did a fabulous job with even 2 bed changes during the week we were there.The main hotel was equally as clean and very attractive, the staff were friendly and attentive and service was second to none. My only gripe about the communal area's are that the pools were too cold to use and my 13 year old son was unable to use the Gym or Spa pool even though he was supervised by us.It wouldn't be up to the standard of a 5* in the UK but we weren't expecting it to be. We had a lovely time, and will return again. Great value and would highly recommend."
Nov 2014,50,"It's so good, we are definitely going back!!!!","I have stayed in some great hotels and was keen to see if this hotel lived up to the comments on Tripadviser. I was worried when I read some recent reviews, but was keen as anyone else to go on holiday. On arrival we were delighted at the gated community, privacy and fantastic appearance of this resort. We were welcomed by Elizabeth on reception, who throughout our stay was 100% effective and supportive to our every need. We upgraded to a studio as it had a kitchen, as the main room allocated was a king room with bathroom. A small €, which was worth every penny. This complex has lots of pools, small, medium and large. A beach that is at the bottom of the resort, very quiet.  A few people have mentioned the food being disappointing, some don't realise that when you are in another country the first food on offer is their local cuisine! Then they offer a range of European food to support others. Having been in Portugal on several occasions this is so in all hotels. We were half board, breakfast lunch or dinner. We opted for lunch, which was al-a-cart and delicious. 5* for the most enjoyable lunches I have tasted for a long time. The staff were all professional and happy to be there. My only area for concern was the FREE transport shuttle to the Old Town. The bus held 27 people, you needed to queue 30 mins beforehand to ensure you got a seat. A taxi was €6 to town if there was no seats in the bus. The pillows could be a bit better, I managed to find a good one. Our friends found their beds a little firm, we were happy with ours.Overall, we loved our stay. We are big cruisers and would say this holiday have us all the relaxation and time out we wanted. We will be back!!!! 😄"
Nov 2014,50,Superb hotel,"This was our first stay at this hotel from Oct 22nd for 8 days and it did not disappoint! Beautiful hotel, very clean and spacious. The scenery around it is just stunning. The decked area with the swimming pools is lovely and relaxing. Two pools were heated and one is a salt water pool. We booked a Sea view suite which overlooked the pool area, and it was lovely to hear the sea, and have a nice view in the evening when we sat on the balcony.  The pool area is well lit. The air con was great and the room was cleaned every day, and fresh towels left out. The bed is massive,but mattress is too hard though. There is a mini fridge in the room which you can keep your drinks in. The bathrooms are lovely. The plug sockets are EU so take converters or rent some from reception, they give you the money back when you leave. There is a bus free bus which takes you into the new town and the old town a few times and returns to the hotel which saves on taxis. A taxi ride to the new town is approx 4 euros and 8 euros to the old town.We booked on bed and breakfast basis. The breakfast is amazing and is beautifully laid out.There is something for everyone, full English, be warned this is not always hot! Sausages are revolting but the rest was nice. Lots of fresh fruit, cheeses, cereals, freshly squeezed orange juice, pastries, rolls and breads, even champagne!The beach is lovely and is just a short walk down from the hotel, we liked the pool area though as my daughter wanted to play with the other children in the poolThe staff are very polite and helpful. I will definitely be returning to this hotel I think it really deserves it 5 stars!! :)"
Nov 2014,50,Fabulous Spa and friendly hotel. I highly recommend!,"I am just finishing a lovely five night stay at this fab hotel, which I booked through www.spabreaks.comI was made to feel very welcome and felt the staff went out of their way to be helpful. When I found that the buffet restaurant had no vegetarian dishes, the chef cooked beautiful meals for me every night, ranging from vegetarian curry to pumpkin ravioli which was my favourite. The waiting staff were friendly and very attentive, and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast is plentiful, and you can sit outside and catch the sun, or in the shade in tasteful surroundings.Even though there were families with children, there has always been a quiet spot to sit and relax, and it is clear that the hotel caters for a good mix of clients, which makes for a nice atmosphere. It is not too stuffy, nor is it too noisy.The thalassotherapy spa is amazing. I had experienced the thalassotherapy circuit before but only in a small pool. Here, you can swim, relax and take your time between stations - about an hour in the pool was long enough for me, but I could have spent longer, and I had it to myself most days. Treatments were half price this week, and so I indulged in a hot stone massage, and George was brilliant. I did not get all my therapists' names but would like to thank all the spa staff for making my programme extremely effective and relaxing. I had seven treatments as part of my package, including body wraps, lymphatic drainage, hydrotherapy and a wonderful detox facial.For anyone looking to indulge in a relaxing break with great food, beautiful surroundings (direct access to a lovely beach) and caring staff, I heartily recommend the Grande Real Santa Eulalia. I am looking forward to returning in the Spring."
Oct 2014,40,A good time was had by all!,"Just returned from a wonderful 5 nights in this lovely Hotel, staff are wonderful, so friendly and happy, position perfect, close to the beach with a couple of beach bars, enjoyed the pools although one was far too cold to go in, making the heated one very busy with some children behaving quite badly, it states 'no diving', but it didn't stop some older boys from taking a run and dive without looking where they were going to land, and with it being the only warm pool there were lots of babies and young children, it really does need someone to keep an eye on this to avoid accidents. We had a sea view suite in the main building, wonderful! We stayed half board, the breakfast buffet was delicious, the dinner buffet was slightly dissapointing especially if you had children, our 4 year old ended up with room service most nights, I thought they might have a childrens section like alot of other hotels, but on the whole a good holiday!"
Oct 2014,50,Really enjoyed our trip,"Returned yesterday from this beautiful hotel where we stayed in a 1 bed apartment for 1 week. The reception, pool areas and gardens are beautiful. The apartments are very well designed and we had enough room for 2 adults,  2 kids( 6 &4) and a baby( the hotel provided a cot and high chair). The kitchen has all the essential items if you prefer to go with SC board. The hotel also has a fantastic kids club, the staff there were brilliant. The main pool by reception is heated so was lovely....its not huge so it did get crowded sometimes! The other pools were quieter but of course colder as well. Plenty of sun loungers which was good and they provide beach towels( 1 pp/day) which frees some space in your bag.  Theres a beautiful beach next to the hotel. The hotel runs a complimentary bus to old town, queue early for this, saw some disappointed ppl if it got full (27 seats). Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel simply because its beautiful and the services provided are brilliant."
Oct 2014,40,Had it all but needs maintenance ,"This hotel had it all without the snobbery of the usual 5 star establishment. Brilliant seafood pasta, great buffet breakfast, good rides in golf carts to room, great housekeeping, fantastic spa especially worth it at 50% special, children's play area, a couple of heated pools, good beach all though water is a bit rough. We booked the 1 bed apartment and it was about the size of my first London flat. Interesting room decor but bit disappointed by chipping paint and having to pay so much for deck chairs at local beach and how tough the water was. Really hard bed too but the housekeeping tried to fix immediately by adding a layer of padding, but bed is clearly old as I can feel the springs. I would definitely come back here."
Oct 2014,50,Great hotel.,"This is a lovely hotel, with very helpful staff, which deserves the 5 star rating.We had 5 days here recently (very cheap for such a great hotel), the weather was good for October. The staff were on hand at all times & were very professional, the hotels facilities were very good. The hotel room was spacious, clean & had everything you need for a relaxed stay.Friends of ours, also stayed in the apartments, which were equally good. We will definitely be returning in the near future."
Oct 2014,50,julie smith fabulous hotel.,"Just returned from this fabulous hotel.Stayed in one of the hotel suites.Rooms were very spacious two bedrooms and two bathrooms plenty of space to relax. We stayed for one week bed and breakfast.Breakfast was gorgeous.It catered for everyone with fresh fruit ,pastries ,English breakfast .champagne cakes and as much tea and coffee as you like .Staff at the hotel are very attentive  and nothing is too much trouble.The pool areas are very relaxing and the one nearest the hotel is heated which was lovely. For a nice evening out take a walk up to santa eulalia it self .We had a lovely meal at Paulus pizzeria  most evenings .Gorgeous food ,great service ,manager and staff make you feel very welcome .Cant wait to return very soon."
Oct 2014,50,Lovely hotel,Our second year running at October half term. Lovely hotel. Attentive staff. Perfect location. Good value and with a kids  club and tennis courts. We stayed in one of the apartments so didn't have to go out every night. Will return ASAP.
Oct 2014,50,NEARLY perfect,"I will start by saying that this hotel was excellent . The staff were very polite and professional. The rooms were very spacious and clean and bright . The room was serviced daily. The ground were beautiful . It is actually one of the few hotels where the photos tell the truth. We were there bed and breakfast. There was lots of choice at breakfast , including champagne!!! All you would expect from a 5 star hotel. One minor concern was the way you had to queue for a table at breakfast , and I heard several moans about the length of time some people had to wait for dinner. There should be no excuse for this in a 5 star hotel . All they need to do is allocate more area for eating. Overall one of the best hotels I have stayed in."
Oct 2014,50,Our honeymoon,"Awesome hotel ,Awesome setting thats all you need to know. You will not be disappointed.Hotel is spotless the things they do for you is brilliant from the buggy from the reception to your room.The free bus to town.The food.The list goes on.Thank you for the memories see you soon."
Oct 2014,50,Fabulous,"We stayed here last week and had a fantastic stay. We booked a 1 bedroom apartment, which was perfect for our needs as we had our 7 year old with us. The rooms are cleaned every day and every possible amenity is there, including a coffee machine, fridge, toiletries, bath robes etc. the outdoor pools were freezing, but I guess we were staying quite late in the season. The beach is wonderful, but the sea very rough in October. The location is good. On the outskirts of albufeira, set away from the hustle bustle, but only a 4 euro  taxi ride to the strip. Our favourite restaurants were Uzonj and eduardos. Would we return? Absolutely! We'd love to go back soon."
Oct 2014,50,Great Hotel,"Stayed for a short break earlier this year and thoroughly enjoyed it. The rooms are spacious and comfy as well as clean. The hotel in general is clean and the pool areas are great. It's away from the old town of Albuferia  but it doesn't cost much in a taxi to get there in the night. There are some great places to eat in old town, I would recommend heading away from the central area though and investigate the side streets and upper areas for the best places. We ate at the beach front restaurant in the hotel one night and the food was great. Service was excellent and we had no complaints. We had breakfast included and the choice was superb. Everything was fresh and well presented. Overall it's a great hotel. I would always encourage people to get out though and explore the surroundings. The hotel is a great place to relax and we will be coming back again."
Oct 2014,50,7 day stay in October,"What a great week myself and my wife had.We booked a sea view suite full board.No complaints at all re the room. Very good with 2 large bathrooms.Food was very, very good. Anyone that complains about the food  is beyond me. Excellent choice on all 3 meals. Something for everyone.Anyone who complains about the local area, I find astonishing. Yes the New Town of Albufeira is a atypical strip. Everyone knows this surely. However, The Old Town is lovely especially when you get off the beaten track and actually explore on foot. The walk to the Marina is lovely. Where you will find plenty of restaurants overlooking the yachts.The hotel runs a fee bus to the new and old towns. Get in the queue early. The bus is only a 27 seater.The staff were very good, extremely helpful and could not do enough for us.The Historical Algarve trip is very well worth booking a full 10 hour day out. Excellent value.The beach is spitting distance. I see some people have complained that this is not a private beach for the hotel. So what!!the each is huge, plenty of beds for hire 10 euros for the whole day... Cant be bad.Overall would I recommend a family member or friend to go here? Yes I would. People say this is not a 5 star hotel...... Guys are any really quality 5 star hotels to be found On The Beach or other such value holiday search engines?   NO. However, this is an excellent location and hotel to explore the Algarve if you are prepared to look for te real Algarve and not the strip within 500 meters!!"
Oct 2014,30,Average hotel awful area,"This is NOT a 5 star hotel. I have recently returned from a weekend break at the Grande Real. Thankfully we were not staying for the week!The hotel has a wonderful lobby with very helpful friendly staff. It is located on a beach and is only 15 minutes  walk away from bars and restaurants. But be warned the town areas are awful!! Very tacky serving dreadful cheap food.The hotel room was quite disappointing.Brown stains all over the carpet,the room and most of the hotel stinks of cigarette smoke,I could even smell the smoke on my clothes! Not my usual experience of a 5 star hotel! The towels and robes provided are very old and need updating! The beds are very hard with lumpy pillows.The breakfast was lovely with lots of choice and we ate in the hotel most evenings, the restaurant had great service with reasonably priced food and cocktails. I was looking forward to using the indoor pool only to find out that it has a hidden charge of 15euros! The outdoor pools are very small so I am guessing this would be awful In the busy summer months.The free wifi was surprisingly good, and even worked in the hotel room not just the reception area.Overall this hotel is ok, but I would rate this hotel 3 star not 5. I would not stay here again."
Oct 2014,40,Best Hotel in a fairly awful area,"This hotel has a beautiful lobby, friendly staff, great location. It is a 15 minute walk on the beach to New Town and 10 minute cab to Old Town. The pool was impeccable, the beaches also were gorgeous. This hotel has two small restaurants overlooking the beach and water which is beautiful.Now the area in general. Let me start this by saying I am a 27 year old snob. I went on a vacation in Portugal first stopping in Albufiera. Albufiera is the equivalent of Cancun or Panama City Florida. It brings out the trash of Europe. The area was litered with drunk, shaved head, British men. I literally was curious where there wives/girlfriends were. If you go, make sure you spend enough to get a nice hotel like Grande Real. Everything else is garbage. Not to mention if you are close to the strip, buckle up for an experience.If you are like me, stick to Old Town, it is fun entertaining and slightly less trashy than New Town."
Oct 2014,50,Fantastic Holiday & Great Service,"Its been now over 3 weeks since my family got back from the Grande Santa Eulalia resort and I have to say it was a fantastic place. The staff were very polite and made our stay first class, I will return back to this resort and just wanted to say a big thankyou to Ruben Martins, Patricia Martins and Catareina Pessoa.....they made my whole experience first class, thanks."
Oct 2014,50,Great stay!,"We stayed in this hotel in August and enjoyed a lot! Hotel looks even better than on photos,so we were pleasantly surprised when we came. It's on great location and there is beautiful beach just in front of the hotel. Staff is very polite and friendly. As we stayed in apartment we had plenty of space and peace, everything was clean and comfortable. If we return to Albufeira this is hotel we would choose again."
Sep 2014,40,Pleasant stay - mostly!!,"I booked this hotel many months before my husband and I stayed there in mid September. When I read some of the reviews on this site I was quite concerned that I had made a mistake. But this is a fine hotel - for the most part. I liked the decor and did not find it dark or outdated. Our room was big, overlooking the sea and with a good balcony that got sun in the evening. The bed WAS hard and the pillows very small and soft. Toiletries were basic and not always replenished. Towels were ok but not five star quality. I found desk and pool staff very friendly. Restaurant staff were busy and efficient. We never had to queue at breakfast although on a wet morning there was a queue as the terrace could not be used.Breakfast was the weakest area in the overall stay - poor selection of everything, lukewarm cooked food, one toaster which didnt toast the bread, no variety. The pool area is very good, two adult pools, one heated , and one baby pool. There was a more than adequate supply of beds but each guest was only allocated one towel per day. There was easy access to the beach and it only cost €15 per day for 2 beds and an umbrella. There was entertainment in the lounge area in the evenings and we thought it was of a very high standard indeed. The hotel is about 6kms from Albufeira but there was a shuttle bus from the hotel. Anyway, Santa Eulalia itself is only ten minutes walk away and the beautiful little town of Olhous d'Agua is a short taxi drive away.Our flight home was very late on the day we were leaving and we were able to use the facilities of the spa to shower etc. A lovely bonus.One concern, on the day we were leaving a hairdressing show was being assembled and there was a notice to the effect that the pool would close for the following 2 days. Friends of ours who were holidaying in the hotel for a week with their small baby were there during that time and had not been informed of this when they booked. In effect they lost hotel facilities for 2 days of a 7 day holiday and were not told in advance."
Sep 2014,40,Great hotel nice location,Ok well I had a room with a sea view and great balcony close to the bar. The service was friendly and efficient the food in the buffet restaurant was good for breakfast never saw any queues and there was good selection. The dinner buffet was ok again with lots if choice. The alacarte by the beach wasn't 5* but was ok. I love the main building and the bar was brilliant decent entertainment and again very friendly service. Wish the gym had longer opening times but no complaints the room was lovely very large and very clean the wifi is free and that's a massive plus in my books!
Sep 2014,40,Great Hotel,"The hotel itself is gorgeous, set in beautiful grounds. I was on the ground floor overlooking the car park, which I didn't really mind because I had no intention of spending too much time in there! The room itself was comfortable and clean ( the mattress was a little on the firm side but I like it like that ) The pools were clean but could have been a little larger especially for those who like to swim for exercise. You had the option of eating indoors or outside which was nice and the food was ok, although it could have been a little hotter. I was always one of the first down to breakfast at 7am when the restaurant opened and even then it wasn't hot ( not counting the freshly cooked fried eggs )We arranged to go on a trip to Seville one day and because of our early pick up we arranged for a picnic pack which was waiting for us at reception and was really nice.   There was a couple of nice places to eat just out of the back of the hotel, or just to have a drink of which we frequented most days, especially the restaurant/bar right on the beach.  The walk to the strip in the New Town took about 15 minutes where there were many bars and restaurants. There was also a courtesy bus into the Old Town which again has plenty of places to eat and drink and lots of shops!"
Sep 2014,50,We loved it. Thank you.,"We had a lovely self catering room, overlooking a pool area. The view from the bar area was stunning and we enjoyed several tasty salads whilst soaking in the sun. The walk to the ""strip"" is about 15 minutes and it's a lively place. Had a nice meal in the fish restaurant just a few minutes walk downhill from the main entrance. Try it. A decent supermarket a few minutes in the opposite direction. We loved it."
Sep 2014,20,Not a 4.5 star experience,"Stayed here in Sept 2014 and overall, the hotel is good, the bar staff in particular. However, this is a family friendly and a smoker friendly hotel, smoking even allowed at the pool area, and at ALL of the outside eating areas. If you are a childless, non smoking couple, looking for a 4/5 star holiday experience with rest, peace and tranquillity that I believe a spa hotel should offer, then AVOID this resort."
Sep 2014,50,"Very very happy, exceeded expectations..","As we approached the hotel, the taxi driver commented that he really didn't like this hotel, just not nice.. needless to say I was getting a little nervous.. thankfully he then burst out laughing because, even by the locals, this hotel is considered excellent. The service is very good, staff are friendly and helpful, the bars/food are good quality and good value. I didn't try the main restaurant but the beach bar is really great and the pool bar good also, although not as much choice. Rooms were cleaned daily and were good quality, but it was the amenities that really exceeded my expectations. Great access to the beach (although you do have to pay for beds, not overly expensive though). Not only would I recommend this hotel, but I'm looking to go back in the next few weeks, enjoy :)"
Sep 2014,10,Terrible hotel,"Do not stay in this hotel.We are staying here at the moment.Booked a family suite for the 3 of us.We have a ten month old.When we arrived we checked the room.There was no kettle or no area for washing bottles.They ask for childs age when you book your room so we should have been told that the hotel is not suitable for families and we would have booked an apartment which was much cheaper.we had to beg reception for a kettle and we had to buy a basin for washing bottles as we were told the hotel couldnt help us.2 days ago we found out that a hairdressing event was happening and so construction began on a stage right below our room.loud music until after midnight and the pools have been closed to guests fir the last 2 days.we had to switch rooms because of the noise.We paid for a garden view and now we have a view of nothing.The staff have very poor english especially at reception and just shrug their shoulders and say there is nothing we can do.They just dont care.In the two rooms we have been in, the movies do not work and again staff cannot help us with this.managers are always 'unavailable' to speak too.On the web-site it goes on about all the restaurants onsite but on the day we arrived we couldn't get food anywhere and had to pay a fortune for room service.There is no baby style food available although it is advertised as a family hotel.The hotel is going all out for the guests of this hairdressing event and doesn't care about its existing guests.I am appalled at the lack of customer service and how they get away with treating people so badly.I was in tears trying to get satisfaction from a duty manager 2 nights ago and don't need this stress while pregnant. We will never stay in any of the Real run hotels again."
Sep 2014,50,Grande real ,"We had a 1 bedroomed suite which was away from the main hotel with a pool and poolbar close by, everything we could have possibly needed was supplied in the kitchen,  free safe and wifi and plenty of movies on the tv channels. Hairdryer in the bathroom plus toiletries and dressing gowns. The grounds are beautiful and views to the beach stunning. A walk to the strip will take 15-20 mins or you can take the free hotel bus if you are prepared to queue up early. I would like to thank the management for the bottle of champagne on ice left in our room for my partners birthday, you made his day and we enjoyed it sat on the patio area in the sun."
Sep 2014,30,Good hotel apart from the food.,"The hotel was very good apart from the food.  The food was not hot enough and the plates were cold. For health and hygiene food should be kept either hot or cold NOT lukewarm. There was not enough variety of food at dinner. Cakes were left uncovered outside at lunchtime.  The mattress on the bed was hard, had to put two blankets under the bottom sheet.  I would recommend this hotel if the food and mattresses were improved."
Sep 2014,50,Amazing hotel,"We booked this hotel a week before we was due to fly out with jet 2. The website didn't really give much away and when we arrived it wad nothing like I could remember from the photos. It had beautiful grounds and the reception area was lovely. The staff was very helpful. We had a suite with 2 bathrooms with jacuzzi baths, one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The breakfast was great with plenty of choice, full English, cereal, continental,  fruit and even champagne. We didn't have lunch or dinner there but one day we bought sandwiches from the bar which were really nice. The cocktails are great and the bar staff are very professional and friendly. I would definitely stay at this hotel again! The only bad thing about the hotel for me was the amount of weddings there, it got a bit annoying after a bit having to avoid all the photos."
Sep 2014,50,SPECTACULAR !!!,"This hotel is one of the nicest places I have ever been to. Amazing views overlooking the ocean. My son got married there on September 6th, 2014.  The whole day from start to finish was just perfect. The venue was out of this world. The food was five star without a doubt. The staff couldn't do enough, going out of their way. Will be going back very soon."
Sep 2014,40,Good Value,"My sister and I stayed here for a week at the beginning of september.  We got a very good deal as we only payed £350 each for one week at a 5 star hotel, flights and luggage included.We had a self-catered room which was very nice and very spacious. The rooms were cleaned everyday and the towels and bed sheets were changed.We had a pool near our room which was nice and quiet. The pool near the main lobby was always really busy and there were not enough sun beds, so we were glad there was a quieter pool near us.The beach near the hotel is clean and very nice too!"
Sep 2014,40,Great location,"This hotel has a great location right on the beach and only a ten minute stroll to the town of  Santa Eulalia where there are bars, shops and restaurants. The hotel has numerous pools that although not large are more than adequate for a swim. Breakfast was as good as most 5 star hotels that I have frequented but it does get busy after 9am so it does pay to arrive early. The bar looking over the beach was a great place for lunch with great sandwiches and cold beer. The apartment was large with lots of wardrobe space and a kitchen although no walk in shower but that didn't detract at all from the quality of the accommodation. Would we come back most certainly."
Sep 2014,50,Great holiday!,"We weren't so sure where to go, so this hotel seemed a good choice on the photos: by the beach, lovely rooms. A good surprise right upon arrival: from a studio, we got upgraded to an apartment, and with a smile :) So, we got a huge apartment, kitchenette fully equipped, always kept clean by the great staff. The hotel has private parking underground, very convenient. Besides, it is well planned, in a way you never feel in a crowded place: there are three different pool areas, lots of green, very good.As for food, we tried only one restaurant, located near the beach, where we can enjoy the views and a wonderful 'massada de peixe', pasta with fish in a broth! We also visited the buffet restaurant, and it seemed very good, although we never made it there.We would love to go back."
Sep 2014,50,Amazing!!!!,My husband and I have just arrived home from a spa weekend at the hotel. It was absolutely amazing! We have stayed at some fantastic hotels over the years and this tops them all! From arrival to departure everything was perfect. The staff are so helpful and friendly. The breakfast has lots of variety and you can choose to sit inside or outside. It was lovely to have champagne at breakfast on our last day. We ate in the restaurant for our evening meal one night and it was first class service and amazing food. The spa treatments we had were amazing and the staff in the spa were so friendly and helpful. This was a treat for our wedding anniversary and we will definitely be considering returning for a family holiday next year as well - perfect!
Sep 2014,50,Another great say :),"We return to this hotel every year , the resort is spotless so are the rooms - the rooms are dated but nothing is worn (there's the odd scuff on the wall but nothing bad which is what the moaners may class as worn)  and everything is kept immaculate.There's a maid service every day and fresh towels and regular bedding changes. It's 10 mins walk to the strip and the hotel offers a bus service to the strip & old town that's runs on a regular basis.We normally travel with kids the hotel offer bed guards if needed - we've never used the kids club so can't comment there. Try the zoo marine for a great family day out & the sizzling stone is a must for a evening meal.We were pleased on arrival the have bin upgraded from a studio to a 1 bed and was also allowed a late check out with no extra cost :)Will be returning as usual next year!!!"
Sep 2014,50,fabulous holiday,went to the Grande Real for 1O days end of august/beginning of September.  We booked in and we were taken to our studio apartment in a buggy and our bags carried to our room. The apartment was spotless and kept this way by the maids who cleaned every day and changed the towels daily.  I had been worried about the bed being too hard as I had read in some reviews but it was fine - and nearly big enough for a family of four to fit in!  We stayed on a bed & breakfast basis - the breakfasts were very good with a huge variety.  There are four pools with plenty of sunbeds round each one and also a toddlers pool and bar/cafe. A shuttle bus ran every hour to both the old town and new town of Albefeira and this was free of charge. The beach runs along the bottom of the hotel - though it doesnt belong to the hotel and you have to pay for sunbeds there.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel and would thoroughly recommend it.
Sep 2014,50,Lovely Hotel in a Lovely Setting,"We had a sea view suite in this hotel with our seven year old daughter and loved every minute of our stay. The suite was clean, comfortable and spacious. We had absolutely no complaints. On arrival we found that the air conditioning wasn't working, but the hotel had it fixed by the time we came back to our room. The pool area was lovely, although not the biggest.We had lunch mostly at the restaurant on the way to the beach and it was always good and they did an awesome white wine sangria. Dinner in the next restaurant along was also excellent.If you're looking for an up all night holiday location this may not be for you, but for a family or someone looking for somewhere relaxing to chill out I'd say this was perfect.We will definitely come back to this hotel."
Sep 2014,30,Nice hotel but definitely not a 5 star,"We stayed in the hotel for 7 nights at the end of August in the classic sea view room. The hotel rates itself as 5* but at best it is an average 4*. The place has a long way to go to quality for a higher rating. Here are some examples of what lets it down. it's mainly the little things but they are important and they are what the quests see.1. pool area is very small and crowded; despite the hotel's policy that sunbeds unoccupied for 30 mins will have towels removed, no-one was taking any action; unless you were by the pool by 10am you would not find an empty sunbed. Also one pool was freezing cold whereas the other was warmer that an average bathwater. 2. our room had a nice view but when we arrived there was a wet chair next to a desk; fridge was not working and leaking badly on the floor (the hotel got it sorted quickly but this should have been noted by the housekeeping team); however the blackout curtains were brilliant and the room was very dark and quiet at night. If you like hard beds you would get a great night sleep. 3. The bathroom did not have a walk-in shower, which you would expect from a 5* hotel, the shower curtain was plastic and not looking very hygienic.  Towel rails were glued to the wall rather than being screwed in and kept falling off; hotel was good at sorting these things out but they should not have been happening in the first place. 4. Public corridors were very dark making the place look outdated and not very welcoming5. Breakfast was OK but did not offer much choice and unless you wanted to eat before 9am you could queue to get into the resturant for more than 30 mins (breakfast closed at 10.30am).6. Staff were OK but nothing more; generally they were very slow and appeared to be quite demotivated; even when the bar was empty you could wait for 15 mins until someone took an order. We had the impression that the staff were just doing their job but did not offer anything extra (an occasional smile would be nice).On the plus side the hotel's location is perfect, close to town and Faro airport (hotel provided a shuttle bus but a taxi was only 6 euros and the town is not really worth going to). There is a also stunnig fish restaurant (Pescatores) right on the beach. All in all we had a great holiday but it would have been even greater if the hotel met our expectations. It is a very good 3*, maybe even 4* but definitely not a 5*."
Sep 2014,40,Relaxing experience and great hotel for peak season,"Family holiday with our 10 year old son. Personally I hate going on holiday in August but with a child at school there's not much choice so to find somewhere so relaxing was a real treat. The hotel was well maintained, grounds beautifully kept, everything spotlessly clean. Lovely pools, great location by beach and short walk to bars & restaurants. Never a problem to get a sunbed. Breakfast was fantastic with everything you could think of, excellent fresh fruit and pastries, even a glass of sparkling wine if that's how you like to start your day. Our apartment was a good size, one small problem we had with the shower was fixed the next day. Our son loved the kids club, simple activities but the staff were great with the kids and he made friends with English & Portuguese children there. All round a lovely place to stay and we thoroughly enjoyed it"
Sep 2014,40,Great holiday,"Spent a week here in June. Lovely place. The buffet breakfast was very good, evening meal was ok but the buffet lunch was very poor. Very comfortable room. Bathroom was lovely with quality fittings. Pool area was fabulous. The sea was icy cold!,,,"
Aug 2014,40,Very Good But Why am I not Thrilled?,"How do you rate a hotel ""Very Good"" but leave and not feel thrilled.  It is on a beautiful grounds with amazing views.  The lobby is fantastic.  The service is excellent.  The beach is beautiful.  The restaurants are top notch.  There is a free shuttle service to the downtown areas.  So what is it?  I think it's the little things...1. It's on a public beach and the hotel doesn't offer chairs or umbrellas which will cost you 50 Euro's a day to rent for a party of two.2. The pool area is small and crowded for a hotel of it's size.3. The room was a bit dated and worn even though it was clean, comfortable and well appointed.4. The hallways were very dark.5. Much of the decor was cheesy.6. Breakfast looked like it was top notch from the way it was laid out but for some reason I felt it should have offerred more choices.I have to believe that the 5 star rating set my expectations high when in all honesty it is really more like a 4 star hotel which got a 5 star rating because it's a resort.  The problem is that when I left I have memories of staying at a 3!  This is also a quiet location where things close early. If you like a lot of activity and nightlife consider staying in the old town where the party goes late into the night."
Aug 2014,50,"A great relaxing week, fantasic hotel!! ","My boyfriend and I have just returned from a week at this hotel. All I can say is WOW! We were blown away with how friendly the staff were and how we were treat like royalty. We were celebrating our anniversary while out in Portugal and the hotel surprised us with a bottle of wine and a selection of deserts and strawberries (a lovely touch) We stayed in a studio appartment and it was spacious and spotless, the maid came everyday and cleaned it. The hotel has fantastic views of the beach and lots of pools. You can always get a sun bed. The free bus into the old town and new town was brilliant and saved us lots of money on taxi's. We would definately return to this hotel! We loved every minute of it."
Aug 2014,50,Superb experience,A great hotel with a superb view over the bay and direct access to the beach where sunbeds and umbrellas can be purchased for a small fee. A variety of pools are located throughout the complex so ideal.
Aug 2014,30,Pools disappointing,"Lovely hotel, room was great and nice beach. Restaurant near the beach very nice. What was most disappointing and let the hotel down was the fact that there was a letter in the room stating that balls and inflatables were not allowed in the pool. However, every pool was packed with inflatables and kids playing with balls. This actually prevented us from being able to swim in the pool. There were no life guards either. We were considering returning to this hotel until our pool experience"
Aug 2014,40,"Decent hotel, but lacking in areas","You'll see from responses to reviews here that hotel is taking a hard line with reviews suggesting the hotel is any less than 5 stars. The hotel may have met the criteria to earn the rating, but does the experience parallel other 5 star resorts? Not really, but it's so a good hotel. Here's our experience:Cons:- It took 3 days and 3 complaints to reception to get someone to fix the broken light on our balcony. I think this was a communication issue since the guy fixed it about 5 minutes after the third complaint. - Reception staff were often curt and mostly uninterested with enquiries. For example the service guide may say ""ask reception about mini golf!"" but when asked they neither know nor care to find out.- WiFi was up and down in the rooms. Pros:- The a la carte restaurant is amazing. The service and food is top notch and deserves to be in a 5 star resort. The staff should be commended. - The hotel decor is tasteful and elegant throughout. - Bedroom and bathroom very nice and well maintained. Very spacious. Neutral:- The breakfast buffet is very good. Just get there before 9am when everyone piles in. It's a circus. - This one is our fault for not checking... seeing the hotel's brochure we imagined a secluded beach resort. It's not. By 9am every inch is covered by parasols and people. The hotel has no facilities there. You can rent a sun lounger for 10€ a day. - The pools are small but adequate to cool off. One adult pool and one children's. There are rules but they are completely unenforced. Most days I saw kids pelting footballs across the adult pools almost hitting swimmers. The staff didn't care.- The cleaners did a good job, but I don't think they have enough of them! They start early in the morning and sometimes would only get to our room by 5pm... by which time we were home for a siesta! Overall a really nice hotel and we enjoyed our stay! It's just very busy so don't expect any special attention."
Aug 2014,50,A great way to see the Algarve,"Having read some of the previous reviews I was not sure what to expect at this hotel. However, I am so glad that we chose this hotel. This is one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in. The staff were very friendly and bent over backwards to help us in any way they could - our safe in the room was broken so we reported it, maintenance was with us within 5 minutes and they fixed the issue immediately. The rooms were spacious and clean - as others have mentioned, the decor was not as modern as it could be but this should not detract from a well kept and clean room. Our room was on the ground floor with doors that led onto our own little patio and piece of grass. While we did not have a sea view this was not an issue at all - how long do you really spend in your room staring out to sea?! The facilities were fantastic and so was the food. We had previously read about the queues at breakfast and were keen to miss these, however we went to breakfast every morning about 9am to find it easy to get a table and food. The only time we saw a queue was about 15 mins before breakfast ended - if you leave it to the last minute then there is more likely to be a queue.The pool area was lovely, there was always a sun lounger available. The pool bar was clean and nice, food was good too. The beach was also lovely and clean.The walk to the New Town was hilly and took about 20 mins - the Old Town is further and may be too far for some to walk but a taxi is only about 8 Euros. The Old Town is definitely better for food and an evening out, just be prepared to wait for a taxi at the rank for abut 40 mins before midnight. If you can wait until after midnight then the wait is halved. I am glad we ignored some of the previous reviews as we may not have ended up staying here and we are very glad we did. We will definitely be returning in the future."
Aug 2014,40,Great 4 star hotel,"Overall a decent hotel - not 5 star, but probably 4 stars with good food, clean rooms, friendly staff and a great location next to the beach.Highlights:The food:  we went half board and ate some fantastic food, but you wouldn't want to go more than a week half board as it can get repetitive. The 1 bed apartment: spacious, clean, quiet, with a lounge and kitchenThe staff: friendly and helpful - we have a daughter with a dairy intolerance and they couldn't have been more helpful in making her pancakes with soya milk, providing dairy free ice cream, etc.The beach: next to the hotel, beautiful and sandy (but like all beaches in Portugal, it's public, so loungers/umbrellas are chargeable and it can get crowded)Lowlights:The beds: they are hard, which we didn't mind, but if you like a soft bed, you won't sleep well here. The pools: they are ok - you can swim in them, there are 4 free pools (the spa pool costs 15 euros per hour), but they aren't massive and only 1 is heated, which means it gets busyThe kids club: we have two 9 year olds and there were fairly limited activities for their age, and a wide 2-12 age group, which meant they were with kids who were 3-4 years younger.The landscaping: the hotel does need a makeover in some areas - tired decking around the pools, some ugly areas around the area between the hotel and the beach - it could be better with a bit of effort and money."
Aug 2014,40,Fantastic holiday had by all,"We have just returned from a 9 night break to this hotel, we stayed in a studio apartment. The apartment was ok, not very spacious & the balcony was very small, however, we holidayed with friends & spent most of our time on their ground floor terrace.The one bed apartments are all on the ground floor & although they aren't much bigger inside, the terraces are a good size. Beds are the hardest I have ever slept on & we all had aches & pains from the very firm mattresses (like bricks). We were taken to our studio on a golf buggy, which was a very nice touch & a bottle of mineral water was waiting for us. The apartment was cleaned each day to a very good standard & dishes were washed, dried & put away by the maids, if any were left. Beach towels are included, 1 per person per day, so no need to pack any extra towels. The pool area for the apartments was much quieter than the main hotel pool & there were plenty of sunbeds. The service at the pool bar was very good, with reasonably priced food & drinks. Cocktails were 6 Euros, which is fairly standard for hotel cocktail prices & you could pay 10 Euros for a salad, or burger & beer/soft drink included. The main hotel was a 5 minute walk from the apartments & we didn't venture in there much, there was a very small games room in there, which we didn't use, as it was indoors with nowhere for parents to sit & relax & it was too far away from the apartments for the children to go alone. There was a kids club, which was more like a creche & apart from that, there was no evening entertainment for the children, the staff occasionally came to the pool & played a game with the children, or started a volleyball game. The setting of the hotel is beautiful, with wonderful beach views from the main hotel, however, there is nothing else within walking distance, so you need to use taxis a lot, or, hire a car. It's a good 20 minute walk to the nearest major supermarket (Intermarche), although there is a very small shop 5 minutes walk, which sells all the basics, including fresh bread. We ate at the hotel one evening, at their beach side fish restaurant & it wasn't the best meal we had, the restaurant actually on the beach & not owned by the hotel was much nicer & more reasonable. We wouldn't return to the hotel, unless we were visiting to stay with friends again, however that's just a personal view, as we did not use any of the facilities & prefer to stay somewhere a little closer to the action."
Aug 2014,50,Great Beachside Resort,"This sprawling resort is what I consider to be a 4.5 stars. Our room was spacious, king bed and a great view of the ocean, from the balcony. Very light on power points in the room. Biggest let down was no tea or coffee making facilities, although the helpful staff provided us with a kettle, cups, milk (which we paid for) and sugar. We thankfully bought our own coffee (a tip from another reviewer). Loved the balcony, where we spent many hours relaxing and drinking in the view. We purchased half board, which includes breakfast and dinner, all buffet style. To be honest, although there is a large selection of various foods to choose from, the food is tasteless, particularly the dinner buffet. The meat is very tough! The desserts are scrumptious though. Breakfast is your usual buffet fare and look out for the champagne which is included!  You may eat in the restaurant or outside, which is very nice.  Suggest that you take the dinner packages for only half of your stay, giving you the opportunity to taste the delights of the restaurants in town or another one in the resort. There is also beach side restaurant, short walk along the beach, with the freshest of seafood, delightful to have lunch, dinner or a few drinks there.We found the staff all very friendly and helpful.The hotel provides a shuttle to New Town which is handy."
Aug 2014,50,"Santa Eulalia Resort, Albufeira, Portugal.","Made our honeymoon experience 1st class. If you can afford it, well worth a visit. Staff couldn't do enough for us, facilities were outstanding. A variety of pools to lounge around, a private beech to enjoy with water sports available. We included breakfast in our package. Have no complaints about the food, the range and choice was very good with a very professional service. Situated between Albufeira old/new towns and Vilamoura in Santa Eulalia. A free shuttle bus is provided to drop you in various locations throughout the day up to around 7pm. Very peaceful in the evenings. We had an apartment which was very nice which was decorated very well in a bright Portuguese style, it was a very pleasant place to be. I also have to commend the cleanliness of the resort, never saw one piece of litter, our bed was changed daily, fresh towels daily, and they cleaned it thoroughly, they even washed up. A truly fantastic holiday, we haven't stopped smiling."
Aug 2014,50,Best Family Holiday!,"We stayed here at the beginning of May this year. We have 3 boys under the age of 5 so it was a bit daunting as we had a bad experience 8 months previously at a different location. All our worries soon evaporated. We had 2 x 1 bedroom appartments & brought reinforcements with 2 other adults. We had such a great time. We went half board so all our breakfasts & evening meals were in the hotel. The breakfasts had the best selection i have ever experienced from Cava to cereals & pastries to bacon & eggs. The evening meals were a bit more limited but we always found something to suit our tastes.We stayed by the pool outside our apartments and it was brilliant. We didn't feel the need to have to move. The kids had a small pool to play in with the other children in the surrounding apartments. We were so close to our apartment we could go back and forth for cold drinks from the fridge.There is also a kids club which all our kids loved. We went everyday after breakfast. Our 4 year old could stay without adult supervision and they ring you when your child has had enough. The staff at the kids club are so nice and friendly. They have different activities each day. Our kids loved the face painting.There is also access to a beautiful beach at the back of the hotel. We only went once due to our baby, but it is well worth a visit. IF you are looking for a supermarket, there are 3 small shops within 10 minutes walk when you come out of the resort main entrance and walk to the right.We will definitely be back!"
Aug 2014,30,An 'upmarket budget' holiday hotel,"The hotel was clearly built to serve as a luxury resort but it has too many short comings to be its awarded 5 stars. Please bare in mind that this review is based on us staying in one of the apartments and not the hotel. We are a family or four - 2 infants aged 18 months and 5 months.The road and paving around the hotel and apartments rivals the Champs-Elysees for cobbles so for a family with two infants, one of which has to be in a buggie, we were miffed at being placed in the furthest possible apartment. I almost broke my back carrying the buggie to avoid waking our 5 month old in the evenings and my wife had to carry our son to avoid breaking his ankles. The cobbles look great but an adequate side pavement could have been thought up. Not to mention the noise the delivery trucks and cars make on the road all day made our apartment feel it was actually in central Paris.Apartments are definitely not 5*. Basic but comfortable although our bed was the hardest bed Ive ever slept on and I normally like firm beds, this took the biscuit though. Wifi in our apartment was intermittent to non existent. Wifi in the main hotel was weak at best with some hot spots in the lobby providing adequate wifi.Front office staff - you get the sense they are seasonal staff. Not that friendly ex a couple, not that knowledgeable about anything (booking golf courses in particular) and given there are normally three to the desk that have to perform everything from checking in/out and what a concierge does, I failed to reach the reception by phone on two occasional as they were too busy so had to walk the cobble driveway to get it done. Food - the restaurant near the lobby has a nice but limited menu so one night ticks that box. The others are so-so with a typical buffet dinner with a selection to be expected. Breakfast is good however. Seafood restaurant overlooking beach is worth a visit. I would recommend walking out the main gate, turn left and 50m down the road is Restaurant Martins which serves great Portuguese food cooked to perfection and reasonably priced. In the old town I would recommend a trip to Dom Carlos Restaurant - owned by an Irishman and his Portuguese wife, cracking fresh menu and great wine.Positives - fantastic kids club with very friendly staff. We used the babysitting twice and felt very comfortable and happy with them. Its definitely a family friendly hotel despite the cobbles. Beach is also very nice even though its a walk down to but one of the nicer beaches in the area. Restaurant actually on the beach is also great for seafood. Pool areas are also very well organised and equipped.Believe it or not, despite my review we'd probably return if we chose the Algarve again as the kids love it. Just make sure you ask for an apartment near the hotel and venture out for food."
Aug 2014,40,2nd visit good but didn't hit the mark,This is our 2nd visit here in the past 4 years & I totally agree with happy_me_h The hotels is right on a gorgeous beach the pool areas are lovely plenty of pools & sun loungers! The first time we stayed we thought the breakfasts were amazing lots of choice & omelettes and pancakes cooked to order - this time not so good everything was just ok ! We also stayed in a 1 bed and our wardrobe really smelt musty too our toilet seat was cracked and the walls in the bedroom had lumps out of them?? But on the plus side the wifi is fab a real plus for the kids! It's only small things but the last time we stayed there were bubble bath and smarties and crayons left daily for the children this time we got 1 bottle of kids bubble bath! It just isn't hitting the 5* mark at the moment! The staff are lovely and the kids team & activities have really improved which is great to see!  The hotel is in the middle of nowhere and although there is a bus service to the old and new town we found getting back crazy as we are are family of 5 & most taxis only take 4 so we had to take 2 taxis back! We do really love this hotel but there are areas that could be improved ! I would recommend this hotel and we will return in the future!
Aug 2014,50,Brilliant for Children,"My Wife & Son spent hearly all of July here. This is their third time this year and we chose it as we just have one son so an excellent kids club is a must.The Kids club here is the best we have come accoss. There is something for children of all ages. Loads of different activities and really well organised. Tennis, Football, volleyball, indoor games, teenager zone, just lots going on.The apartments are snall but well kitted out. Free wifi and my son raved about the breakfast.Highly recommended."
Aug 2014,50,A first 'adult only' holiday that lived up to expectations!,"I have never written a review before, but because I now use this service as a deciding factor when booking my own holidays, I think that it is important to advise others who are considering particular hotels.  Firstly, my partner describes me as 'hard to please', and yes, this is true!  However, there was nothing displeasing about this hotel.  We stayed in a self-catering studio and were delighted by the cleanliness, space and view from the balcony.  The staff were completely professional, yet friendly, at all times.  Only two small issues...ants in the bathroom and kitchen area, but rang reception, and it was addressed within five minutes (no sign of the little mites again!).  Light on balcony did not work.  Did inform reception.  It wasn'tdealt with, but no big issue.  Enjoyed the cocktails at the bar overlooking the sea, but 'he' complained about the price (just ignored him).  Had two treatments in the spa...full body massage was glorious, but disappointed with facial (would advise that when face pack is on (therapist left the room for quite a while), an arm and hand or foot massage would be appropriate considering the price).  Absolutely no issues getting a lounger and parasol at the pool.  We only used the free shuttle once, and there were no issues.  We adore walking, so were happy to do so every day and night into the new town.  Intermarche fabulous for  some grocery shopping.  Very reasonable.  Just turn left out of the hotel and walk for 10 minutes.  Lovely fresh bread, meats and fruit, which made an exceptional breakfast!  Have recommended this hotel to all my friends with children.  We will probably stay in the main hotel  when we return as we no longer have to consider our 20 year old daughter when we go on holiday!"
Aug 2014,40,Great place as long as you don't expect the height of luxury,"This is the second time I've stayed here with my family. My wife and two kids (6 & 4) are having a great holiday. The issue I think this place has is that it presents itself as a high end luxury 5 star resort when really its a little bit shabby around the edges. The star rating system isn't universal and most are based on facilities, so I guess technically this is 5 star. The problem is that people expect 5 stars to mean perfection or at least very high end luxury. The hotel resort grounds and reception/bars are excellent. our room is a 1 bed apartment and its a bit shabby in places. For example the bedroom smells a bit musty, the chairs outside are fraying, some of the woodwork is broken, our toilet seat was broken, no batteries in the tv remote. To their credit when I told them about the toilet seat and batteries, they sorted it within the day. The service is generally pretty good. The location is amazing right on a large beach with plenty of sun loungers. The pool area by our apartment is great and we've never struggled to get a sun lounger. Only downside to the location is that you need to drive to get anywhere else, unless you you're OK for a 5 mile or round trip. We would be up for that but the kids are a bit too young. The food in the bars is OK but avoid the seafront ""fine dining"" restaurant. Its over priced, mediocre service and unexciting food.  Best tip I have is walk left out of the front gates of the resort and 1 min down the road is Martins. It looks a bit basic, but the food is amazing and really reasonable priced. All in all this place is great and I think reasonable value for money, as along as you don't expect it to be the Ritz by the sea! 6"
Aug 2014,50,Lovely hotel,"Stayed here in July 2012 and returned in July 2013Beautiful hotel, great service, unbeatable location.Stayed in a nice and spacious apartment with a patio with pool views. Lovely clean room with excellent maid service. The pool bar was great. Breakfasts were lovely. It is right on the beach with a lovely restaurant and snack bar. Albufeiras nicest beach in my opinion. Great range of water activities at the beach, fantastic service and professional photography with jet skiing at €20 pp, pedalo rentals for €15 and ring boats at €15pp.When I stayed the hotel offered free buses to old town. The hotel is a walkable distance to the strip,  also nearby restaurants and a supermarket. I recommend yellow fish transfers to and from the airport, €60 return for two people with great service as opposed to €50 one way in a taxi."
Aug 2014,40,Right on the beach,"We stayed here in July 2014 beautiful hotel reception 24hrs and very friendly. We went self catering and I can honestly say the apartment had everything you needed. The rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels. The hotel had its own gate to the beach which was ideal, however it was a 25 minutes walk in to the town, the hotel did provide a courtesy bus but this only ran every hour, however taxis were very reasonable. The hotel had 3 large pools all with adequate sun loungers we always got a sun bed.The only thing that I can say bad about this hotel was on our first night we ate at the hotel restaurant my Husband is a veggie and the food was very limited we spoke to the waiter and he had the chef make him an omelette which I thought was a very nice touch, unfortunatly my meal was not a nice it was cold and tasteless and very expensive for what it was."
Jul 2014,50,Fantastic,"My partner and I had ten nights at this hotel for his 50th birthday. Everything was top class.Fab room. fab food. great pools. there is a very strong rule not to leave sunloungers for longer than 30mins so that people can always get a lounger and most of the time it worked. Fantastic staff.the staff brought a trolly to our room with champagne and a birthday cake for my partners birthday we were overwhelmed with emotion.We were a bit stuck for entertainment on an evening there wasn't much in the hotel,It was a FANTASTIC holiday and we hope to go back sometime. we went with JET 2 and would use them again.."
Jul 2014,50,10 night stay in July 2014,"We just got back from staying 10 nights at this hotel for our 1st anniversary, Absolutely beautiful Hotel, just stunning! what a 5 star hotel should be! our room was lovely, had a fridge, good air-con, plenty of room and a great view of the sea & gardens etc. All staff were very helpful and courteous, food and & drink was great too with plenty of restaurants which are part of the hotel, lovely swimming pools and great access to the beach. Its location for me is perfect, not too close to the madness of the new-town and basically has its own beach, 15 mins walk to the new-town where there are loads of bars, nightclubs, restaurants supermarkets, etc. also the old-town is about 15 mins after that and has to be seen its really nice, plenty of stuff to do for the kids here too, they have a lot of activities and a kids club and its great for a couple too. Only 30-40 mins from hotel in a taxi, We used Yellowfishtransfers.com for our transport they were great and for €30 one-way or €60 return, great service really reccommend them, We are already planning another trip to the Algarve and if we can afford it we will defo be staying at this hotel again! Best Holiday ever! Thanks."
Jul 2014,30,Not 5 star hotel - female reception staff very rude,Id say this is a 4 star hotel - def not 5 star! The rooms are nice enough but a bit dated - air conditioning very efficient. Housekeeping do a brilliant job though!There are lots of apartments/ rooms in this hotel and they do have 3 different pool areas so generally getting a lounger was easy enough - the pools arent big but my kids at aged 9 and 5 loved them! Not sure they would be big enough if you wanted to do any proper swimming.Breakfast was chaos - loads of people all jostling for the buffet! They do make omlettes etc but they have one person doing this and queues were long and shambolic. The choice was nice enough but really didnt enjoy the shoving/pushing that so many people do at these buffets.My main gripe was the reception staff (a younger and older woman) - rude doesnt even come close to describing them! The younger one insisted I didnt have a reservation on the first evening I arrived and shoved my reservation slip back at me 'not this hotel' she said shaking her head! I pointed out the booking was further down the page as we were staying a different hotels - no apolgy just shrugged her shoulders! The shuttle bus is also a joke - sits 27 apparently but they dont tell you it picks up people before it arrives so usually its busy! The queue is long and chaotic and personally for the price of a 7e taxi fare isnt worth the bother! Again rude people shove on before others and we were left not getting on. The older woman at reception was so unpleasant when I asked her about this and if she could get us a taxi - shrugged at bus being full and shoved piece of paper at us with 'taxi reference' on it! Taxi drivers dont even bother to check this and again ignorant couple jumped in our cab - when I asked her about this she shrugged again and said 'I told you to wait outside' (which she didnt!). Those 2 definetly need some lessons in customer service. The hotel is ok - outlook to the beach is lovely but I think if I was returning to Portugal I wouldnt stay here again.
Jul 2014,50,Fantastic Family Holiday!,"Myself and my husband travelled to the Grande Real Santa Eulalia for eight nights with our three children (aged 9,7, 7), staying in a self catering apartment. We found the service to be excellent and the atmosphere to be relaxed and laid back at all times. The hotel caters perfectly for young children, whilst also maintaining an air of luxury for adults. The restaurants overlooking Santa Eulalia Beach are fantastic,  there could be no finer location in which to sit, relax and unwind. Whilst Albufeira was not at all to our taste, there are sufficient facilities and outstanding eateries in the vicinity that you would never need to venture into the town to enjoy a fun filled break.To sum it up... this is a fabulously good value luxury family holiday destination and one of the few places we have been that we will plan to return to. We would highly recommend it, particularly for those travelling with children. Enjoy!"
Jul 2014,30,Keep expectations low,"Let me first start off by saying this is not a 5 star hotel.  It's nice enough, however, the carpeting was stained and faded in our room and the first morning we were there our shower head fell off the wall.  Luckily maintenance did fix it while we were out for the day and we came back to a fully functional shower that night.  Also, the beach attached to the hotel is extremely crowded.  My husband and I rented a car and we were able to drive to much nicer and much quieter beaches in neighboring towns.  The hotel seems ideal for families with children (and there were a lot of them), but may be not the best hotel for a couple just looking to have a quiet, relaxing trip."
Jul 2014,40,Good holiday but not without hiccups,"Was here for 7 nights in May 2014. It didn't start off well as the front desk didn't look very organised and it took me quite a while to check in (there was no one in front of me in the queue). I stayed in the apartment and this was well equipped and clean. The wifi stopped working on day 2 of the trip and never worked again. The stay was good up until the last night when the smell of sewage overtook the apartment and we had to change apartments. On the final day, an hour before we were going to check out, the hot water stopped working just when we were about to take a shower. The hotel staff at reception didn't seem to care about the inconvenience this was causing (my 15 month old daughter with me). To cut a long story short, I was fuming with the hotel. However the manager was apologetic and compensated me for the inconvenience caused. All in all, it is a good hotel as long as nothing goes wrong."
Jul 2014,40,A gem on the outskirts,"The hotel is really a great resort with MANY families. The front desk team are all young and were all helpful. Would like to call out Guyro (Jerome) , really went out of his way to provide us with recommendations for restaurants, and took the time to find us our special Dolphin Cave tour on the Black runner. A totally amazing experience .We ate at the buffet each morning and they offered a nice selection with typical European buffet dishes coupled with, fruits,breads and pastries, cheeses meats etc .They will also make custom omelets. However, I will also note that they only have 1 person cooking these for all the guests they need to serve during breakfast. They should have 2 there's way too long a wait. We at lunch and had snacks/wine down near the beach restaurant. Great staff, very friendly, foo was great and all spoke english. Try their Gelato for dessert!!One day we ate at the pool and again, they have one guy cooking burgers on a stove top with  1 grill, 1 burger at a time for all those guests at the pool. My recommendation, get barbecue going and then you can sell burgers! Each day we had cocktails outside off the main lobby, the bar staff were all super friendly and accommodating.The room was really large, very bright, good lighting in the bathroom. The only 2 things I would add is get new pillows, and they should offer better blow dryers. (or lesson learned I need to start traveling with my own!)The housekeeping staff does a great job , room very clean, with plenty of towels.The beach at the hotel is beautiful and found its really crowded in the morning until about 1 then gets quiet. Loads of people. They rent beach chairs for 5 Euro and if you want an umbrella its additional,  even after  5PM. But you can also lay on the beach with beach towels which is also very nice. Hotel provides these. They offer wifi but it didn't work very well in the room so we ended up in the lobby many times to get online.Took taxis into both new and old town each night as the hotel is not close to anything, As many have mentioned they have a shuttle but it stops early. A couple of nights we used Suzanne and her husband  they have a taxi service and always seem to be nearby the resort with no waiting, I booked them to take us back to the train and they are totally reliable. All in all a great 4 nights of relaxation and would recommend this property."
Jul 2014,50,Great family hotel,"Having just returned from the Grande Real Santa Eulalia with my wife, daughter, son-in-law and 2 grandchildren aged 8 months and 4 years, I have to say how impressed I was with the whole experience.  We had 2 resort suites with their own patio area which were spotlessly clean and well maintained.  The pool area for our part of the complex had plenty of sunbeds at any time of the day and was very spacious.  There was never any need to reserve a bed, there were always some available.  We had half board and the food and service were excellent.  High chairs were quickly provided when needed.   Staff were very efficient and polite and our luggage and ourselves were transferred on arrival and departure by golf buggy (our 4 year old grandson especially enjoyed this).  The hotel also provided a free bus service throughout the day to Albufeira.  There was easy access to the beach from the hotel grounds.  I would definitely return to this hotel."
Jul 2014,40,Great but not 5 star,"Have just returned from a short break at this hotel. It is more 4 star than 5 star. Breakfast was nice enough but chaotic with so many people needing to be fed.  The issue for me was the pool and sun beds. They stated in the literature that sun loungers cannot be reserved and that towels will be removed if left longer than 30 minutes. This did not happen.  Everyday I had to get to breakfast as early as possible and eat breakfast quickly to get try to find a lounger without a towel. Once in situ I observed that most of the unoccupied loungers with towels remained unoccupied for well over an hour. In some cases 2 hours. Some parents had babies in pools they stated were for older children/adults and although they stated ball games were not allowed a blind eye was turned to such games. My view is you either have these policies and enforce them, or don't bother. The pools in the main hotel are tiny and you are packed like sardines, not really 5 star luxury compared to other 5 star hotels I have visited. You can always walk down to the beach, but that's not really what you pay for with a five star hotel. The resort is lovely and clean, everyone is friendly and helpful and the ladies cleaning the rooms do an excellent job. All staff serving breakfast and in the bar/reception very pleasant. This hotel would be great when under occupied or perhaps in early season."
Jul 2014,40,Lovely family holiday,"We have just returned from here having had a really lovely family holiday. The hotel is in a beautiful location and has super views over the beach. The public areas are all beautiful. We had a hotel suite with sea views which was perfect for a family of 4. Had our children been older though, the sofa bed would not have been suitable. Breakfast was plentiful with a wide choice of food. The hotel was clean and out rooms were well looked after. The beds are very hard and even with a mattress topper we didn't notice much difference but it wasn't a huge issue for us. The pool area is a bit tired looking and the wooden deck could do with some attention but nothing that would spoil your holiday. The pools are quite small and the largest of the pools was almost always empty as it was so cold! Even in June/July it could have done with a little bit of heating.  The kids club was fabulous and our children enjoyed an hour or so there most days. The staff are friendly and helpful throughout the hotel. It is probably not truly a 5 stat hotel but it is certainly an excellent 4 and we would definitely return. We ate out most nights in either Albufeira old town or Villamoura but the couple nights we stayed in the food was also very good although I think would become repetitive after a few nights. The gym doesn't open until 9am and the kids club is 10am. There is a little quirky thing with the towels that you are issued a card that can be 'redeemed' for 1 towel a day but the kiosk doesn't open until 10am. We would definitely return for another holiday."
Jul 2014,30,Not 5* I'm afraid,"Definitely not 5* hotel. Lots of good things and some bad, but do NOT expect 5*. Good things:-Room well equipped with lovely balcony over looking pool (self catering apartment although we were half board, but we appreciated the space).-Swimming pool area good. Always able to get a lounger. There are a number of satellite pools around the resort which is great as it means you're always close to a pool. -Free bus into Albufeira old and new towns.-Appreciated the free indoor baby play area.-Staff very child friendly. Often random staff passers-by engaged my little boy which I appreciated. -I know this is pretty basic but the chamber maid was great. Really gave the place a good going over every day and was tolerant of us when we kept being in when she was trying to clean! -Free/good wifi.Bad things-Food (a big deal). Consistently grey, unappetising and not much taste. Very mediocre. Breakfast was fine, but dinner was consistently ""meh""! The plates of food at buffet had an attempt at being well presented (i.e. a border of lemon halves to make it look decent, if a little 80s) but the actual taste of the food was very bland. Interestingly there were marketing images placed around the hotel of gorgeous looking food that I would have loved to have tucked into; shame about the reality.-80s decor.-I was disappointed with the star rating. We deliberately chose this place due to its high star rating and paid more than other deals out there, but it's a 3 star...maybe 4. I find it hard to articulate all the multiplicity of reasons it's only 3/4, but suffice to say definitely do NOT expect 5*.This hotel is totally fine if you're expecting 3/4 stars, but not if you're paying extra looking for something close to 5*."
Jul 2014,50,wonderful hotel,"this is our 8th year staying at this hotel and it is still fantastic. brilliant staff, brilliant kids club, lots of pools to choose from, and great beach.everything is also very clean and the hotel housekeeping is the best we have known anywhere.but it really is some of the fantastic staff who make it so special-Philip and Mario in the restaurant, Carla at pool bar and john and Antonio in the kids club. they go the extra mile to ensure every guest has the best possible timewe shall return there again next year"
Jul 2014,50,Superb Hotel,"The view from our hotel was superb overlooking the pool and sea. I was totally surprised when I opened the door, we had a double bedroom with a big bathroom and another room with dining area and another bathroom. both had large flat-screen T.V's and we also had 2 balconies. There was 2 dressing gown each and the whole hotel was exceptionally clean. The only point I would like to make is that it needs a food shop on-site and tea/coffee facilities in the bedrooms. It is also quite a distance from Albufera, but I liked that. Apart from that it was superb and I would highly recommend."
Jul 2014,50,Amazing hotel and staff,"Myself and my partner had an amazing break at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Spa. From the momment we arrived we felt relaxed. The entrances were all electric gated which made us feel safe and secure knowing they had a good security system in place. After checking in at reception a lovely young man took our cases and showed us to our room no 203 with a great seaview :) Our room was large with a lovely big balcony overlooking the sea and was cleaned daily to a high standard. we were also very impressed with the food, always a good selection we went full board so had breakfast, lunch and dinner all of which were great! The best thing about this hotel are its staff they were fantastic! always helpful and there to greet you, always happy and cheerful and nothing was ever too much trouble for them. Also the Resturante staff were great we were really well looked after and couldnt fault the service in any way! we even had the chance to have a look around the wedding venues which were lovely and excellent prices so we are hoping to look further into this shortly. Overall we cannot fault anything about this hotel and we were concerned after reading some of the reviews but are happy to say that It is the best hotel we have stayed in so far and look forward to returning for another break soon! thank you! Becky & Adam"
Jul 2014,50,A 5* hotel in Europe that really is a 5*,"I travel 2 or 3 times a year to hotels similar in price and similar in standard  - this is easily one of  the hotels with the highest standard that I have stayed at! Where earlier reviewers have suggested this is not a 5* and more like a 3* I can only wonder if they stayed in the self catering apps and not in the main hotel as the main hotel is wonderful! My daughter and I stayed in room 108 and had a lovely sea view. We were the first out to sunbathe every morning, which was at 9am, how refreshing not to have to get up in the middle of the night to secure a sunbed! Beds were still available every day until after 11am. The breakfast had lots to offer, and again no queues at 8am, 9am or even 10am.The staff were, as people had previously commented 'very friendly'Access to the private beach was through a gated area also offering access to a restaurant one level down which had wonderful views overlooking the Ocean. Prices were reasonable, with lunch each day for 2 mains and drinks costing between 17Euro and 22Euro. Lots of choice.Had read previous reviews on Tripadvisor I was a little concerned about being in the middle of nowhere....this is NOT the case. Turn left out of the hotel gates, walk for only 14mins (at a very slow pace I add) and you will arrive in Santa Eulalia town.  This has 50/60 bars and restaurants and food was really good in the 3 we ate in. Another 5 minutes further and you were in New Town. So I can only assume some people wish to come out their hotel and be in the middle of a bustling strip - which isn't for me. A 10-15 minute walk and  everything you could need is available. Old town is only 7Euro in a taxi and offers you more choice. On the last 2 nights live music entertained us from a duo called 'table for 2' excellent - so lots and lots of choices for evening entertainment.The only few things that could make this hotel even better are extending the shuttle bus to include a couple of evening trips to Old Town, at maybe 8 and 10pm, as more people wish to go out and about at night as oppose to day, when the bus was half empty. Also 15Euro for a sunbed on a private beach is really steep The lovely terrace area showing ion the photo's is not available to use and only seems open for weddings - perhaps this should be taken off the photo's as having them there suggests that it is a facility we can use and it isn't.Overall though wonderful wonderful wonderful and we will be going again."
Jul 2014,20,Very disappointing hotel,"5th July 2014. I have just returned home after staying at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia resort. I can hardly think of anything good to say about this hotel it certainly doesn't come close to any of the 5 star hotels I have stayed at before, I would be generous if I rated it 3 stars. Apart from one extremely officious waitress in the restaurant the staff were excellent, helpful and friendly but service was slow mainly due to the outdated computer system.The high price I paid was for a room with a sea view but all you could see from my 3rd floor balcony was a brick wall being the rear of the beach restaurants, OK yes I could just about see the sea over the top but it wasn't a nice view.(see photo's)The beds are the worst I have ever tried to sleep on, terribly hard and seemed to dip too one side.Despite several complaints to reception about the internet it never worked in my room. The web sites deceptive photo’s show a lovely view with dining tables overlooking the beach but this balcony is only used during wedding ceremonies but locked at all other times to hotel guests.The swimming pools are tiny (see photo's),one is very warm, probably from all the kids peeing in it and I was amazed to see one mum thoughtlessly breast feeding her baby in it, just think of all those germs,the other pool was just above freezing.The food is very poor standard, the English breakfast consists of bacon that is more like shoe leather, the eggs are crispy underneath and runny on top, scrambled eggs are a cold watery mush, all the food is cold as only the flies check that its at their desired temperature, this led to my partner and myself having upset stomachs during our stay.Evening meals are no better, still not hot, there are no children’s favourites like chicken nuggets or French fries, the bits of fish were OK but the bowls of processed salad with lettuce and tomato everyday became very boring, worst of all they charge an extra 3 euros for ice cream per scoop!A small glass of house wine is 6 Euro and an ice filled glass with a little coke is 3 Euro, water is expensive too, I think it should always be included free with half board and inclusive deals.All prices are extortionate when you consider a good bottle of wine is only 4 Euro in the town. Always pay as you go, don’t charge it to your room as mistakes were often made on the bills that one female waitress refused to correct blaming the till operator.  The hotel is not within walking distance of shops of any kind so you either have to use the shuttle bus which was always full or take a taxi which costs between five and seven euros each way. Be warned they drive like Jeremy Clarkson at the Nurburg ring.I advise eating and drinking at the lower beach restaurant its better value but not great.It’s a lovely beach but a sun bed and parasol cost 15 Euro a day for 1 or 2 persons, buy your own and save money. I have many favourite hotels but this will never be one of them even if I was to be offered 2 weeks free."
Jul 2014,30,Pity about dinner,"With the exception of the food this is a very good holiday hotel. It's well located on the beach, a lovely terrace to sit on above the sea for drinks. Good bar staff  , good reception staff , bedrooms are large and clean with a very comfortable bed and very quiet indeed. The bathroom has an over the bath shower and is more than adequate. Evening entertainment was really good ; background music provided by a couple of guitarists playing well known cover versions of modern music very well. Breakfast was average except we had to queue behind at least 40 people when it was busy (. 5 star ?) . An apologetic member of staff told us that the hotel can accommodate 700 and the dining room can sit 150 !! The dining room staff rushed around doing their very best to turn tables round quickly. One thankfully quiet night provided a strange insight to their operation. Senior man , Nelson, when told we required a table to seat 11 said we would have to 15 to 20 minutes ! The dining room was quiet and I saw 2 tables at a glance that would take all of us. He was very officious and told us we must book for the following evening even though we were there half board.Anyway the food at night was poor. Repeat salads and poorly cooked , poor quality meat and fish and a display area for the buffet which was often too small for the numbers in the restaurant . We ate in 6 nights and never had better than an average meal and frequently worse ...the soups were so bland as to be not identifiable ! It's a pity as the hotel is on a great beach and is good in most other respects."
Jul 2014,50,A haven a stones throw away from the hustle & bustle!,"Me & my boyfriend have just got back from a 5 night break here, we we're in room 102 with a sea-view on a b&b basis. It was our first time in Portugal.The Room.We had two twin beds pushed together, the beds are firm but very comfortable and extra pillows were provided, I slept like a baby every night which is a rarity as I normally struggle sleeping away from home! A large flat screen TV with a few English channels, large vanity table with drawers and a chair, and a small coffee table with armchair. Large wardrobes/drawers and cupboard area, plenty of space for storage. Lovely bathroom with great shower pressure, bath, toilet and bidet. Toiletries provided aswell. Large towels and bathrobes. Rooms can be cleaned daily if you wish (just hang the card on the door) - beds made, hoovered, dusted, towels changed, balcony sweeped etc - very good - they leave the room spotless.  The Location.The hotel is in Santa Eulalia, a small town beside Albufeira. 30min drive from Faro airport, 5min drive to the New Town and 10min drive to the Old Town. it is possible to walk to the New Town but the walk there is a bit hilly and gets a bit steep. A bus is provided to old and new town at regular intervals throughout the day and also offers a pick-up service which comes in very handy but can get filled quickly in the evening drop-off (only 27 seats so queue early) The other option is a taxi - 4 euros to new town and 7 euros to old town, reception can call you one and it arrives in minutes.New Town is a strip full of bars, clubs and a few decent restaurants - Wild&Co is superb albeit quite pricey, but definitely recommend saving one night to eat there - the steaks are sublime!Old Town is beautiful, lots of lovely white villas and apartments overlooking the beach, a square with lots of little bars and restaurants, and cobbled streets with little souvenir shops etc.The Hotels' Facilities.The hotel is in two sections - as you drive in the self catering apartments are on the left and right, with their own pool. It was apparent that a few guests did not realize how far they would be from the main building, which is a 4min-ish walk away where all the restaurants, reception etc are.The main hotel building is beautiful inside and out, 2 main pools are fairly small and it seemed one was for parents and children and the other anyone else! Plenty of sun loungers available, even very late in the day, and the hotel operate a hogging policy! If a sun lounger is left unattended with towels on for longer than 30mins they will be removed!As mentioned we only booked for breakfast, but this was fantastic 8AM-10.30AM, full English breakfasts sausages bacon scrambled/fried/boiled eggs, baked beans, hash browns etc. Continental - a selection of breads, cheeses, cold cuts and delicious pastries. Pots of tea (Tetley! :)) and gorgeous coffee served to you at your table. Delicious pastries. Cereals, fruits and yogurts also available.Cannot comment on other restaurants or lunch and dinner because we did not use these but if the quality is anything like breakfast, I don't think they would disappoint!The hotel also had a spa which we did not use, but did go and have a look and it seems lovely.The hotel is on the beach, a short walk down a few steps and there you are! They provide towel cards to retrieve a towel for beside the pool and the beach, and you can change these once daily by reception between 9am and 6pm.Overview.A fantastic hotel with friendly staff ready to help with a smile. In a perfect location in my eyes, a short way away from the hustle and bustle of the newtown! Cannot praise it enough and would definitely consider returning! Thankyou Grande Real :) xx"
Jul 2014,30,Seriously not a 5 star!,"Having just checked in we're instantly disappointed. The pools are tiny and over crowded with strangers packed on top of each other and not a single sunbed is free! We've had a salad for lunch served from a plastic bowl. I ordered tuna and probably got half a tin and a bit of greenery and a token olive. There was nothing 5 star about that.The parasols are frayed and tired.We arrived with numerous bags, buggy, car seat and baby. There was no concierge to help us.It's an ok place, just not what we expected given the photos on the website and the 5 star rating. Probably more 3 star."
Jul 2014,50,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed here last week in May, room 480 (self catering apartment). The hotel is absolutely beautiful and staff are very friendly.The hotel lobby is grand and lives up to it's 5 star rating.The rooms are very brightly decorated but truly feel having stayed in a few 5 star hotels that I don't understand the negative reviews. They won't compare to UK 5 star hotels but clearly this reflects in the price?!? so I believe that people have unfairly rated the rooms. Can't comment on food as we didn't eat but the rooms are massive and provide you with all you need for self catering facilitiesHotel bar has a lovely view but is slightly expensive but again it is a 5 star hotel.The location to the beach is literally a few minutes however it's quite far from the old town. There are buses but we used cabs a lot (€12/13 there and back) bus was €1.80 so a lot cheaper but there is LOTS of different routes it goes and we often got very confused etc so a cab was easier.Pools are lovelyAll in all it was a lovely stay, although we wouldn't return to Portugal we couldn't fault the hotel"
Jul 2014,50,Absolutely,"I cannot praise this Hotel and their staff enough, first time to Portugal,( but will definitely not be the last). From arriving to leaving we were treated to the best service we have ever had, the bars the kids club for our two grandchildren. the room, everything, i cannot say a wrong word and will definitely return. i was a little worried having read some reviews before the holiday, but soon put at ease, even the views are fantastic. Thank you for such a memorable holiday."
Jul 2014,50,this is just the most perfect hotel I have ever stayed in,"There is nothing negative I can to say about this hotel.We stayed in an apartment had booked a studio but were upgraded with no extra cost to a suite apartment.I had requested a quiet part of the hotel and it was perfect just the cry of the sea gulls.Everything you needed was only a few minutes away..beach,restaurants,pools,supermarket and tour buses.We came here for a Wedding and that was really well organised with a delicious meal and great atmosphere.The staff were so very friendly and helpful.The rooms were spotless and pleasantly decorated also the beds were comfortable. We spent 10 day here and left really"" chilled out"" after a very stress free holiday."
Jul 2014,50,Just what was needed,"We spent 10 nights here at the start of the holiday season - wonderful visit. The rooms were spotless and very nicely decorated, the pools were clear and sparkling (honestly) and the staff were great. Two minutes walk to the beach from the room, and 10 minutes to the new town (40 minutes to the old town) with plenty of choice in terms of restaurants and bars. Very relaxing experience altogether."
Jul 2014,50,Very nice hotel,"Lovely hotel, about a 15 min walk from the strip. My only problem was the nearest restaurants are always full, so a walk is quite necessary and it's no fun in the heat of the day. The rooms were very large and clean. The pools are ok, nothing special. Staff very friendly. I found the mattress a little hard but asked at reception for a mattress topper, this was provided that night. Breakfast we found was bearly warm, but a very good selection."
Jun 2014,50,Luxury accomodation on the Algarve,"Set in a beautiful location up above a very sandy beach, this hotel ticks all the boxes for a luxury yet family friendly hotel. We stayed in a well appointed two bedroom villa and we had the choice of a local pool to use or the three pools at the rear of the hotel, overlooking the sea. For breakfast there was a lot of choice and the other restaurants were good quality. Bar snacks were available in many locations including the pool bar. The hotel is located about half a mile East of Albufeira new town and there are good local restarants to use nearby, (I can recommend: Martins, Brazil BBQ and the Royal Chinese.) Staff were friendly and helpful and I can thoughly recommend this hotel."
Jun 2014,50,Great hotel ,"This hotel is wonderful for those looking for peace and relaxation. The hotel itself is beautifully presented and very grand. Situated on the edge of albufeira in a gated resort, right on the beach. Food great - staff could not have been more helpful. Would happily return without a doubt!"
Jun 2014,40,Lovely stay!,Had a lovely short break in May. The resort was quiet and staff friendly. Love the beach cafe and rooms were very clean. Breakfast had plenty of choice but the fry-up wasn't very nice. Great late deal!
Jun 2014,40,Great week long break.,"My wife and I had a great room (241), which was really 2 rooms, one being a bedroom, the other was a seating area. The rooms had 2 TVs, 2 en-suite, 2 balconies, in fact 2 of everything, superb.In addition we had a great view overlooking the pools, bars, and most important a sea view.We were on a bed and breakfast basis, and in spite of other reviews, we couldn't have been more happy with the fayre that we could have for breakfast, something for everyone.The lay out and décor of the hotel, as well as the grounds, were excellent.The hotel was a good walking distance either way to other bars and restaurants, but the hotel supplies a shuttle bus upto 18.30 hrs, and taxis back are reasonably priced.The hotel can be proud of its standards and staff it employs, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quiet and relaxed holiday in a friendly resort."
Jun 2014,50,Wedding hotel,"We got married in this hotel on 26th May and it was perfect. The seas lounge offers stunning views, and all our guests agreed it was amazing. We stayed 3 nights in the hotel and I cannot fault it. Having champagne with my breakfast on the morning of my Wedding was a lovely surprise. Our room was big enough for me & 3 girls to get ready, along with a Photographer snapping away, we weren't falling over each other. When it came to checking out, I didn't want to leave. We will definitely be returning to the hotel, hopefully next year to celebrate our 1st Wedding Anniversary!"
Jun 2014,50,loved it,"This was our first time visiting a 5 star hotel, a definite treat for us and our 4 year old son. We stayed in apartment 404 which was a stones throw from the hotel and facilities. The blurb says its great for families, its definitely right!  Upon arrival we received a Weekly Program which was very helpful, detailing Spa Promotions, Restaurant details, Kids Club itinerary and bus service schedule (Free bus from the hotel to the new and old town) This hotel has a choice of 5 pools, kids club, beach on its doorstop, food to suit all ages.... everything we wanted for our family holiday. i knew this combination would be ideal for us, and I was right. We chose to go bed and breakfast, which suited us perfectly, huge choice of prepared fruit, cooked or continental breakfast, ham, cheeses, even glass of bubbly every day if you want! We ate breakfast at different times, and never found it to be too busy or the cooked breakfast to be cold. We were impressed with the little details, i.e. the choice of boiled eggs - 4 minutes or 8 minutes boiling time.The pool bar is expensive for food, 6 Euro for a simple ham and cheese sandwich, and 2.5 Euro for a coffee (with UHT milk) We had sushi one night at the Bar Do Real at the hotel (Wednesday to Saturday) which was amazing, fresh and tasty, would definitely recommend - we paid 23 Euro for two of us. There was plenty of choice for kid friendly food here too. Can recommend the cocktails - they were perfect.Having an apartment really worked with having a small kid, as he could go to sleep and we could then sit on the balcony (every apartment has an outside space/patio area or balcony) admire the gorgeous water feature which was lit up and enjoy a glass of wine, a book or a film. (Wi-Fi is great here) This suited us fine, if you are after loud night-time entertainment then I wouldn't recommend here really. We were so shattered after crazy beach/pool/4 year old antics it was bliss :-) I also enjoyed a massage at the spa, they offer 30% or 50% off treatments every day so wait until you are here to book. I agree the décor in the apartments may not be to everyone's taste, but it is nicely done and very clean. It was lovely to have a cleaning lady in every day with fresh towels and to wash up! (We didn't buy any washing up liquid!) Fresh beach towels every day at reception and they provide you with a clothes airer to dry items on. Anything you need is basically a phone call away.The times we dealt with the staff who worked there was always good, nothing too much trouble. I agree the staff are very kid friendly. On the ""hard mattress"" issue, both of us had no trouble sleeping and definitely did not get bad backs.  The only negatives I can mention are that the shower in our bathroom was either too cold or too hot, (we didn't mention it at the time so I suppose our own fault) and that the poolside toilets seemed to be in need of repair. Both of these things did not in any way adversely affect our holiday.This hotel has won awards and I can see why, it simply has all you need for a family holiday. We would love to visit again."
Jun 2014,30,A reasonable stay,"This hotel is in two halves! The self catering apartments and the hotel rooms. The studio rooms are very nice, clean and well equipped. The pool area is small but ok, pity the pool bar never opened and it's a long way to the other bar. The breakfast is good but expensive, the cafe on the beach is ok but service is very very slow! The fish restaurant further down the beach which is not part of the hotel is fine but the staff are not pleasant. We used taxis and the transfer bus to go to the Old and New town, this was nice but busy.All in all, nice beach, nice sea, ok food, ok hotel, but some customer service training needed."
Jun 2014,50,Highly Recommended,"Had an amazing time here, by far the best hotel ive stayed in, here's why;We booked an apartment rather than a hotel room as we have a little one, which was so much better as we had more room to breathe. Cannot fault it at all. Flat screen TV in front room and also in bedroom. Bed's very comfortable, the maid service was exceptional, they come every day and spring clean it, even doing our washing up! One day i left some washing out to dry on the chairs outside (not knowing there was a washing line), they hung all my clothes out to dry for me!Kids Club - I was in 2 minds before I got there whether to leave my daughter, but once there i knew that a couple of hours with the kids club people, she would have more fun with them than us! She went in a few days just for 3 hours and they put so much activities on for them, whether its face painting, playing games, using the playground outside... once a week they even put on kids parties, bouy castles, a reptile show.  Really really good.Used the beach bar the most for food/drink,lovely view sitting there at lunch and more reasonable prices.Venturing out of the hotel we liked going to the Old Town (the New town is for youngsters under the age of 25 I'd say). we ate at a couple of restaurants and they had entertainment in the square.  Went to the marine park one day and saw the dolphins and seals, well worth it.Hotel amazing, i really want to go back next year. Staff very helpful, booked our activities and helped out with anything we needed.  Very clean hotel. You never have to walk far to find a pool, wherever you are on the resort."
Jun 2014,20,5 star self catering .. i think not.,"just returned from 7 night stay at grande real, i thought when i entered the apartment i was in a kids club as decor with green painted furniture was terrible, wallpaper torn in a few places, kitchen worktop had a huge split beside the sink (a trap for germs), electric sockets a bit loose,  and a very musty smell from the two wardrobes. the bed was really bad and i can only assume it was broken in some way.  The hotel is classed as 5 star and it may well be, but the self catering apartments are a very long way from 5 star as claimed.  Luckily for us we had family and friends staying in a villa nearby so we were able to spend our days there, otherwise we would have complained to reception after our first night there. i will say that the rooms were clean and the staff very polite.  another reviewer compared this hotel against the 4 star porto bay falesia.. we have stayed there in the past and have to agree with their comment that the porto bay is a far better choice.."
Jun 2014,30,Definately not five star,"Just arrived back from a disappointing five day stay at this hotel. Originally given a studio room within the grounds which more suited the standard expected from a budget holiday however after complaining was offered a room more suitable within the hotel. The atmosphere in the evenings was dull to say the least therefore had endless taxi's in search of entertainment as the shuttle bus finished too early for evenings out. Was asked to pay 15 euros to spend one hour in the spa pool.On the plus side the food was good, beautiful beach location  and staff very polite and accommodating,"
Jun 2014,30,Family Holiday end of May,"We stayed at the Grande Real Santa in the last week of May 2014. When we arrived at around 12:30, we were told that our room wasn't ready yet and to come back at 2pm, when it would be ready for us. So we took ourselves off to get something to eat in the garden restaurant within the resort. We arrived back at reception at 2:15pm and asked if our room was ready. I was told by a rather surly receptionist that the room was not yet ready. I enquired as to why we’d been told that it would be ready at 2 pm and when it might be ready. The reply was a very curt ‘don’t know’ and a shrug of the shoulders and then she just walked away, not the best welcome I’ve ever experienced. We eventually got into our room at 2:45pm. The resort suite we were given was of a good size, clean and with a fair range of facilities (3 x flat screen TV’s, free safe and plenty of crockery/pots etc, along with free Wi-Fi). However the Resort suite is actually an apartment and not anywhere near what you’d expect for a 5* hotel, much more like an average 4*.  The Resort apartments are also a little way from the main hotel, although each Apartment village has its own small pool, but unfortunately the pool bar was never open whilst we were there.We also had friends who were staying in the hotel itself and whilst their Superior sea View rooms were of a good size, they were still very much average 4* hotel rooms (The Lapa Palace this is not). Because we had a young child with us, we’d booked half board, the breakfasts were quite reasonable and the chefs were happy to knock up an omelette on request. We also didn’t happen upon any of the long queues for the restaurant, as other people seemed to have encountered (we went for breakfast at around 9:15 and dinner at around 7:30). The food served buffet style at dinner was ok, if a little bland. On a couple of nights we opted to order from the a la carte menu. The food was much better, although unfortunately you can’t use your pre-paid dinner voucher to contribute to this, as you can in most other hotels.I’m conscious that I’m painting a rather unsavory picture here, as there were things that were done well, including the children’s play areas and the cleaning staff were efficient and polite. But I do think that If you compare this hotel with the genuine 4* Porto Bay Falesia down the road (we stayed here last year), for the level of service and general ambiance, there is no comparison.  The management would do well to take a few lessons from this hotel.Maybe this just isn’t my kind of hotel, but when it markets itself as a 5* hotel, you’re only ever going to be disappointed. When we were leaving we inquired about a late checkout, but unfortunately the room was required (we were able to leave our bags in a room near reception) and in fact we were told that checkout for the apartments was 10am as opposed to 12 noon for rooms in the main hotel.  We were checked out by the same surly woman that had checked us in. Hopefully at some time in the future she’d feel able to welcome guests with a smile and not treat them like the inconveniences they obviously are."
Jun 2014,40,A Lovely Relacing Holiday,"Just arrived home yesterdat after a 5 day break away at this Resort.  We stayed in a Studio apartment which was quite nice plenty of space for the 2 of us and it was spotlessly clean.  The staff at this Resort were excellent, extremely polite, nothing was too much trouble.  The hotel stands on its own little beach which again was very clean and extremely quiet. the whole area around this hotel again is very quiet, if you want nightlife you really need to taxi into Albufeira.  We weren't too bothered as the hotel bar area was lovely and not over priced.  I only have a couple of criticisms,  it would be nice if the hotel had a small shop of its own on site selling your basics, water, juices, wine, beer, maybe some fresh bread etc for those in self catering and also the hot cooked breakfast was usually cold.  We tended to get there for 9.30am each day, our friends were early birds around 8.30am and they didn't have the same trouble.  The continental breakfast was fine with plenty of choice.  Overall I really liked this resort and would definitely return either with girlfriends again or my husband. Lindsey J"
Jun 2014,30,Too high expectations,Studio aparment was roomy and practical for a couple with a baby but the decor is way too rustic for a 5 star.It has 3 pools spread around the resort but they're a bit small.Nothing remarkably wrong but you generally expect more from a 5 star resort.
Jun 2014,40,Good but definitely not a five star hotel,"After staying here, I never could comprehend the rave reviews people gave this hotel. Service was really good, the staff there are really courteous. However, that said, they advertise their hotel as a five star hotel , and we never felt that the resort was a five star resort. We had sea facing rooms. Either there is a different standard for five star hotels in this part of the world, or we have been used to better. The toilet seat was loose and had scratch marks. The quality of the bed was not that great. The water pressure from the shower was laughable. There was no hand wash liquid in the bathroom. Breakfast was good. In general, the stay in the hotel was nice, but the hotel is certainly not worth the 166 Euro per night we paid. Definitely not five star standard. I have seen better. I hope they improve this."
Jun 2014,30,Great hotel but lacked atmosphere,"Lovely hotel, room was good and clean. Had a one bedroom apartment which suited us fine. Beds though were hard and for me not comfortable. I woke up with an aching back each day. Staff were exceptional and very helpful. Although it was unusual that they wanted to charge me 10 euros to play on the empty tennis courts. When a member of staff said he would like to play with me I was then told it would be an extra 10 euros for his company! He was not a coach. Very strange. Food was good nothing exciting. Great location and beach. Lots of families there which did not make the stay unpleasant as there was plenty of room. The swimming pools are small which I found quite strange. Overall nice place but sadly not enough for me to return. The place badly lacked atmosphere, not asking for disco music and heavy beats just perhaps a little more live music at nights in the bar and some music round the pool."
Jun 2014,40,right on the beach,"great hotel very close to the beach staff were very friendly we booked a one bedroom self catering apartment for 2 adults and 3 young children , but they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom which was very big lots of space , 2 bathrooms kitchen/sitting room with microwave hob kettle fridge and toaster , always hot water cleaning lady came every day of our holiday fresh towels we didn't use the hotel for food all that much breakfast buffet is ok but 20 euro each adult under 6 go free , but if you pay at reception before you go in its only 17 euro each , it was was my partners birthday while we were there and the hotel sent a cake and champagne to our room which was a nice touch , not much restaurants near the hotel we did a lot of walking the taxi did not want to take 5 people and two buggys , hotel will ring a large taxi for you but you will have to walk back we did not mind but if your not much of a walker beware ,we normally go to spain but we heard portugal is better for younger kids and i would have to agree , we were there for nine days the middle of may and weather is fine in the day but at night its cold , but at least you get a good nights sleep great trip for start to finish people are very friendly and speak perfect english would go back again but would hire a car to get the kids around , also have to say we booked our airport transfer with yellow fish , very very good indeed 40 euro each way for 5 of us and car seats for the twins , you won't get cheaper than that ."
Jun 2014,30,A for accommodation but C- for food,"Our family of 4 (children are aged 5 and 9) stayed for a fortnight. The 2-bedroom apartment was spacious, comfortable, and clean, with the only quibble being that the mattress was hard enough to leave me with a sore back (and I generally prefer my mattresses on the firm side -- so this was REALLY firm). The grounds are very nice, quiet, not feeling like a big hotel. The staff were for the most part very nice and helpful.    However, the food was the weakpoint -- it was on the wrong side of average, to the point that we probably won't go back. The breakfast was reasonably good, but the dinner buffet was a real disappointment. Meat was of industrial quality, cooked en masse far enough ahead of when we ate it that it just wasn't a pleasure to eat. Chips had the texture of cardboard, and although some veg was nice (steamed mix veg, tomatoes) there were various ""salads"" comprised of chopped up unidentifiable mixed bits that looked more like Chop Suey (which is Chinese for ""leftovers"").  Dessert was the worst: a mixture of tasteless, heavy concoctions filled with cheap vegetable shortening and totally lacking in flavour, to the point that even our kids didn't want dessert. And our kids LOVE dessert.     For anyone who is already stuck there but has the freedom to escape from half-board, I can suggest two nearby restaurants. One restaurant called ""RM"" on the main road serves up a good selection of grilled fish, which we found fresh and very reasonable. Nice salads as well. Recommend to avoid the pizzas, though.   The other restaurant called ""O Pescador"" is down the beach and off to the right, with a beautiful setting, view onto the beach and ocean, and a nice selection of high quality albeit expensive fish.  However, a meal for 4 can easily set you back 120 or 150 euros, whereas at RM you can eat almost as well for half that price."
May 2014,50,Best Holiday ever,"Just returned from the Grande Real Spa in Santa Eulalia and cannot fault it in any way, buffet and champagne breakfast brilliant, staff friendly and helpful in all areas. My kids were blow away with the kids club, cannot thank them enough for making their holiday so special, the staff in the club are great with all the kids and create such a fun environment. Will definitely be back here."
May 2014,50,Wonderful Portugese style,"Very nice hotel, we're very impressed with the decor, especially the bathroom and the colourful tiles.  Bedroom walls could use either several wall lamps or one or two paintings.  Bed was bit hard and very very large.  Looking for a romantic interlude we lost each other, could be a bit smaller.  Small TV in bedroom a bit of disappointment.  We stayed in apartment and were impressed with the kitchen and it's equipment, although we were at a loss of how the extractor above the hot plate worked.  Hotel location great but a bit far to walk to the old town, shuttle was great but none after six pm.  Staff very helpful most of the time and handled complaints very well.  Service staff wonderful did a good job cleaning the place.  Hotel towels were very nice although we were amazed at being charged for almost all the facilities.  Would stay here again.  Albufeira old town very nice, many wonderful places to eat.  Not being big eaters we were impressed with the one meal for two and very impressed to see a costa coffee shop.  Liked the escalators taking us tO the old town.  Really enjoyed using hotel as a base to travel around algarve, liked towns if silves  and sagres."
May 2014,40,A great hotel in many ways,"We stayed at this hotel for the first time just over a week ago, but have been visiting the area for many years.I would loved to have graded the hotel as excellent but there were too many 'little' things that were just not 5 star as we had expected. Having said that we had a great 10 days in a lovely location.The negatives we found were: No UK TV stations apart from Sky News and SportsBalconies to both the living room and bedroom were very narrow with just enough depth for a small table and two chairs., but both had a great sea view!Out of the 4 balcony chairs two were broken and two were very tired and we requested they were replaced. Peopl were allowed to reserve sunbeds and we saw a number of beds reserved all day and no one ever used them this should have been managed by the pool staff.There was a limited food choice on the terrace bar snack menu which was a shame as the food was good and we would have eaten there more often but ran out of choices.On the positives the hotel is well located with good security with barriers and gates after dark and security cameras which gave a good felling of security. Drinks in the pool bar and terrace bar were very good, with a great choice of fresh coktails at a reasonable price for a hotel of this standard. The rooms were very clean and smart our 'Queen' bed was great but too hard for us and this began to effect us as the days went on. The satff were excellent from the moment we arrived and very helpful and efficent. Another excellent service was breakfast with very fresh hot amd cold food including fresh fruit and fresh eggs together with freesh pastries.To summarise its a great hotel we had a great time with just few things that could so easily have been fixed."
May 2014,50,Great accommodation,"My husband, 3 year old and 10 month old and I have just returned from a week in this hotel, I cant find fault with it, the self catering apartment was great, really good cleaning service, staff very helpful -excellent service from all those we dealt with. I would imagine it would be pretty busy in high season but it didn't feel crowded, lots of pools to accommodate the guests, plenty of bars and restaurants, access to a really nice beach, walking distance (15 minutes or so) to Albufeira New Town where there is a reasonably priced supermarket. There was a great restaurant just outside the complex called RM - Restaurante Martin which served lovely food - excellent fresh fish dishes and they do take away food too which is great for eating in or arriving late and hungry, although there is also room service at the hotel. If I was to be picky the beer at the pool bar was expensive and cheaper at the beach bar where we also had nice lunches. Albufeira mainly caters for British tastes -  fish and chips and english breakfasts, there were a few restaurants which served local foods but were harder to find, even the old town was very touristy. Wherever I go on holiday next I would be happy if the holiday accommodation we stay in is as good as this resort."
May 2014,50,A calm that other hotels should emulate.,"Many establishments claim a lot of superficial benefits that don't include calm,something that this abode exudes in spades. Yes its modern and well equipped 5- star resort on the beach,almost. generous rooms and generous spirit as exhibited by staff and management       The only complaint we had ,is that the kitchen obviously caters to English patrons whose requiem in dietary sustenance lack a wholesomeness that we expect in an establishment of this quality. We did find more Portuguese offerings  to our taste.         Our room was high with a lovely outlook,lucky for us,the hotel was not filled with schoolkids ."
May 2014,40,Really Nice Hotel,"Had a really nice stay we had room 119 overlooking a small woodland but there was a side view of the beach. We asked for a nice view quiet room on a low floor and that's exactly what we got. The room was large with a massive bed hat i had no problem sleeping in so not sure why others say they are hard. There was a tv but we never felt the need to watch it. There was a mini fridge (keep key in slot all day else hie fridge goes off ie warm wine) there was also a kettle left but there was no where to plug it it other than the floor no cups left so we took some from the dining room and the cleaners did wash them for us and did not remove them. The room was very clean big bathroom with nice towels and robes the only real issue was the carpet to be fair had seen much better days but thats about the only gripe i have  and i am sure if i complained they would have moved us. The breakfast was typical 4 star fair but i did find the full English part a bit cold on some days better to be down early and when its busy the turn round is faster so food lays about less. There was a selection of English and continental inc cava if u fancy  8am tipple !! not for me but i did one day as it was my partners birthday. Talking of that when we went to our room to get ready to go out at evening there was cake and cava with plates and glasses waiting wow i was impressed the cake was lush they must have been spying on us cause it was not there that long before we go to the room. The pubic areas are all stunning and very clean . The pools round the hotel are very small so no good for swimming more like cooling off pools. The heated one was also full of kids most of the time even tho There,s a kids pool. there are 2 more pools within the grounds nr the apartments that seemed very quiet indeed. The pool bar was so expansive we only used it once or twice same with the lobby bar but the views from there are really good. The bar prices was 4.5 euro a pint and 3.5 for half !! that was local larger not import shorts where almost 6 euro each compared to town where a lot of places offer a pint for 2 euros so a big difference. However one tip the beach bar is much cheaper 3 euro for wine and about the same for a pint still dear but cheaper then home and the views where amazing. Over looking the beach the beach is not private a all and there where no sun beds as it was low season not that it bothered us. There is a coat walk over the cliffs from this beach as well pat the hut with the pedalos. Location wise about 15 mins from top of new town 20 min to strip on foot and 45-an hour to old town if your a walker there is not a great deal to see in the area as such. I liked old town but its quite touristy not much culture really.  The was no night time nor day time entertainment its all low key at this hotel so if you want to do do nothing then it for you. Cat comment on spa never went but judging by the price i don think many people do. One point i have to make is the staff i really dont bother much with staff at hotels as i rarely need help and to be fir most hotel staff are s happy as we are after all they are at work. However at this hotel i have never met such helpful nice staff ever in any hotel i have been to they are  all helpful friendly and polite and bend over backwards to serve an help. 10 out of ten for all the staff. Oh also the food at beach bar was not to badly priced and pretty good quantity for snacks try the pastry with the vanilla filling yummy, All in all this is a good hotel to chill out we never had issues with the free us either as it was low season saying that the weather was in the 90,s sooooo hot.  We had a good time although i don think i would return to this part of Portugal unless it was on a good deal as its to touristy, But i cant fault the hotel bar the carpets and bar prices so enjoy. Netto restaurant is recommended stay away from anythin other then Portuguese food as tourist food was rubbish night life is better in old town than new town strip good for 20 something or try wild n co this is a great night with cocktails and rock groups top of strip."
May 2014,50,Excellent holiday again,"Stayed in grande real for a week over easter in a suite which was our eighth visit found the hotel to its usual high standards, the televisions in the room have been upgraded to flat screen televisions now. There was extra entertainment on for the children over easter which was good. The breakfast was excellent as always and the evening meal was very good.The staff were very helpful to our needs especially Paula on the reception, the hotel has a very calm atmosphere and caters for families very well. We shall definitely be returning again later in the yea"
May 2014,40,Solid good,"We're here now, in apartment rm 480 towards the back of the resort. It's clean, spacious and everything works! The apartment suites are a little dated, 14"" TV's don't really cut it now! And the decor maybe needs a little updating. The only gripe so far is the beds, the mattresses are rock hard, I can normally sleep on anything, but I woke up with a bad back after the first night so jot a good sign. It's a good walk out from the main tourist areas, we walked to the old town last night and it was a solid hour walk, and a 7 euro taxi back. Breakfast in the hotel was plentiful and the pool areas look very nice. The clientel at the moment seem to be young families or retired folk, so we fall into the minority at the moment, but it may just be the time of year."
May 2014,50,A great family holiday that wasn't all about the kids!,"Having three pre-school sons we have done our fair share of off-peak family holidays over recent years, and up to now have opted for ""family friendly"" apart-hotels run by a big tour operator.  When booking Santa Eulalia we therefore feared our children would fair less well without the usual razzmatazz of water slides, giddy reps and blaring nightly entertainment.  We also feared that other hotel residents would fair less well having their tranquillity shattered by three boisterous boys. On the contrary, this is easily the best family holiday we have ever had.  Our two bedroom apartment was spacious and well equipped, with an excellent daily maid service (the obliging maid even did the dishes and folded my nightie when I neglected to do so).  The hotel staff were very welcoming, and we never once felt that our children were a burden, even in the restaurant.  The baby pools may have been just pools, but never underestimate the appeal of jumping into one repeatedly for a small child, especially when you equip them with a couple of water toys.  The highlight was the beach: on the doorstep, golden sands and blissfully quiet!  From what I could see it was mainly frequented by hotel guests and locals, and we spent hours there soaking up the atmosphere and sun shine.  There were football nets in the gardens outside our apartment, and a park which went down well with the children.  A club was available with seemingly excellent facilities, although between the pool and the beach we never felt the need to avail of it.  The evening meals were delicious and I was delighted by the fact that not a pizza or french fry was on offer, forcing my brood to try the many mediterranean dishes.  It was simple and delicious cooking, a real culinary adventure.  The dishes the chefs created with vegetables were amazing - it's been hard going back to steamed broccoli this week - and the desserts were equally memorable (the boys are still talking about that chocolate and cream cake!)  Breakfast was decent, although the traditional cooked variety will always be better at home which is probably as it should be!       How wonderful to have fresh beach towels every day, lightening the packing load.  The spa looked amazing with daily discounted treatments which I was unfortunately unable to have.  Had I not been pregnant, I would been there like a shot!My husband and I basked in the peace and quiet, the excellent cuisine and (for me) the utter cleanliness of the place.  I will find it very hard to return to a commercial family hotel no matter how tremendous the water slides.  It was so refreshing to have a holiday where we didn't feel like tourists, and wasn't just about the children with no detriment to their experience."
May 2014,30,"If I had a comfy bed, I'd be in Heaven","Good things = free wifi! So I can post TA reviews! Also the cleanliness - very clean. And the facilities in the apartments - has everything you'll need, even a kettle! Gardens etc are very attractive. Staff are quite friendly and helpful, better than average, I think. AirCon = very efficient (I'm freezing - and I'm a middle aged woman! We're NEVER cold!)Bad things = the beds in the apartments are rock hard!! I'm currently waiting for some unfortunate to haul a softer mattress in. Also, the resort seems to be split into 2 halves. The ""Haves"" who live in luxury in the main hotel building and the ""Have Nots"" who occupy the self-catering apartments at the rear of the property. Guess where I am?? I see a lot of reviews from families with small children and (having several of the little blighters myself), this is a good place for kids. But I've done my bit for humanity and the sound proofing isn't up to much in the apartments (which is where most families seem to stay). Even as I type, somebody's having a right strop about putting his shoes on.So, having realised we're in the wrong place, we asked if we could upgrade (paying a supplement) to the Grown Up section (ie the hotel). Sadly, no rooms with a sea view are available so we're stuck in Kiddy Korner. But having said that, the little ones I've spoken to are adorable and we got this break at a reasonable rate with BA anyway. And, I don't think the hotel rooms have tea and coffee making facilities (but I'm not sure) and I like to have tea or coffee in my PJs at any time of the day or night if I want it! Plus the weather is good and the cocktails (and bar staff) are excellent. So there is much to recommend it. We usually rent a villa when we come to the Algarve anyway, so its probably just the shock of having people around us that is making me enjoy this slightly less than I should.If I had a comfy bed and slightly quieter neighbours (and a sea view), I'd be in heaven!I feel slightly mean about the rating - its better than Average, but I'm not sure it rates as Very Good. If the softy mattress turns up, I'll change it!"
May 2014,50,Excellent - Best European Holiday,"Just returned from the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel Spa, myself, hubby and 3yr old. We had a fantastic stay from start to finish. Will definitely be recommending this hotel to my family and friends. We stayed in room 463, lovely covered terrace and right beside the pools we will be asking for this again when we return, hopefully end of Sept/early Oct.  There seems to be limited availability for this time which I can understand, I'm sure everyone who stays here books soon after returning."
May 2014,50,Lovely family stay,We stayed here back in March for our 2yr daughters first holiday abroad!Although we didn't go at peak time of the year and the weather wasn't so warm our stay at this hotel was pretty much 5stars though the decor and carpet in the rooms were old that was the only negative comment we could have made.The staff and amenities were highly recommended and rated most of Algarve was quiet however our hotel was business as usual and has facilities for all ages such as a play area for kids and a luxury Spa for adults we felt quite spoilt and never felt the need to leave our hotel! We found the pools clean and the beautiful beach is only 50yards from the hotel perfect spot for a stroll and pictures. Food at both the terrace cafe and main restaurant is tasty and fresh we have special food needs but never felt it was an issue as there is a great variety for all meal times. Feel the need to mention that the hotel manager was very attentive to our needs we arrived at the hotel at 9am and was allowed to check in early and because we were a party booking with 2 reservations we didn't realise we had very far but also different room types we asked to be closer and both party's stay in the sea view this was accepted much to our appreciation as we paid slightly different prices for rooms.Overall I could not fault or find little knit picks about the hotel! If I came to Algarve again I will be sure to stay here again!
May 2014,50,Amazing holiday,"Loved our stay at this hotel. Would definitely rate this hotel as a 5*. All you need to do is walk left out of the hotel for 15 minutes and compare it to other 4* hotels around. It is in a gated complex and has beautiful views. I stayed with my partner and we were celebrating a special occasion. 10 minutes after checking in we got a knock at our room door. The hotel had provided us with a bottle of champagne, mixed fruit and chocolate sauce! Free of charge! At the beginning of the week the hotel was quite quiet but started to slowly fill up. Still plenty of sun beds. The hotel is quite out the way of albufeira however the hotel has a free shuttle to take you to the old or new town. The last one is at 6.15 however it is only €6/€7 in a taxi back. We would also recommend a trip to vilamoura. We obtained a bus timetable from reception and caught the bus right outside of our hotel. This cost us €4 each to get there and approx €17/€20 on the way back in a taxi. The marina is full of luxurious yachts and surrounded by nice bars and restaurants. One tip when staying at the grande real Santa eulalia if you want to pick up some things from the supermarket turn right out of the hotel and walk for 5 minutes. There are at least 3 in that direction!"
May 2014,20,Not great ...,"You already know before you go Europe 5 star is really more like 4.  Well this place lived up to that assumption.  When the room isn't ready for 2 hours when you get there, you have to have an argument to get a towel for the sunBed, when there are no sun beds on their private beach, queue for breakfast was all the way up a flight of stairs and then it rains!  I'm not blaming the hotel for the rain but they were sadly under staffed when it did for 2 days.  Really average, if you get it cheap it's worth going"
May 2014,50,Fantastic Find!,"A wonderful find for a 4 night break away! Accommodation was excellent, clean and tidy and although we didn't have a sea-view room, it was more than adequate.Breakfast was a real winner, providing hot and cold buffet style, eat as much as you like, and we really did, especially as we sat on the terrace in the glorious sunshine every morning!The beach was private and just a stone's throw away, electric gated, safe and secure with no one trying to sell you a single thing all day.The staff were very helpful and extremely friendly, so all I can say, it that we'll be back!Recommend this hotel without a doubt!"
May 2014,50,Comfort Plus!,"Accommodation was the big hit here, we reserved a resort view suite and were really impressed by the size of it. We had a bathroom each, and a separate area with settee, armchair, table and chairs. Two balconies - one had a sea view if you stuck your neck out - what a win! Food really good and varied, catering for all tastes and requirements. There was a buffet every night for people like us on half board terms, a bit disappointing that we were refused the opportunity to pay a little extra to choose from a Table D'Hote Menu one night. Many different nationalities at the hotel, added to the charm and it is very close to the beach, which was a tad more stony than we expected. One tip for the hotel is to invest in a channel that showed The Masters Golf, disappointing that a 5 star in the Algarve failed on such a basic level. Courtesy Bus to Albufeira was excellent and well driven, arrived on time on every occasion we used it. Service was excellent, gleaming and shining accommodation thanks to the professionalism of the cleaning staff. Brilliant reception staff, welcoming and knowledgeable, very well trained. Children had a ball at this hotel, staff very child friendly and were very tolerant. Popular 'Kids Club' kept them entertained, and lots of happy faces reassured that they really were engaged in the activities."
May 2014,50,Excellent Stay,"I booked a surprise break at the hotel from April 24th to 28th for my partner and I to celebrate a special occasion and as we had never stayed at the hotel before I was hoping it would meet our expectations.We couldn't have been more pleased, the location, virtually on the beach, was fantastic, the buffet breakfasts were varied and tasteful, ranging from full english to selections of cold meats, cheeses etc with lots of extra choices. Our room had a lovely sea view and a huge comfortable bed, with flat screen tv (which we hardly watched, as the sky was a sky blue and wall to wall sunshine each day).The hotel spa facilities were also very good - with the spa daily offers particularly good value.The Hotel staff were helpful, knowlegeable and efficient, particularly the Reception, Breakfast, Housekeeping and Bar teams.A superb touch was the 'surprise' arranged by the reception team for my partner of champagne chocolate and cakes when we returned to the hotel after a leisurely day beachcombing.Would we recommend to others - definitely. Would we return? definitely."
Apr 2014,50,Beyond expectations,"Me and my partner stayed in this hotel for a long weekend break from April 25th to April  28th and this hotel made our break perfect. From the moment we arrived and went through the electric gated entrance and saw the wonderful front of the hotel we knew we had found a gem. We did to pay a great deal for the holiday and wasn't expecting much of a room but we opened our door to find a clean, big and very comfortable room. Free wifi was great, as was the breakfast, hotel decor and the friendliness off all the staff. The pools were nice with a quiet but classy pool area with stunning views overlooking the each below and ocean. Would highly recommend this hotel 😌"
Apr 2014,50,Heaven,"Had an amazing visit to this hotel, and didn't want to come home.  the service is brilliant.  It's right on the beach, and the spa is out of this world. Spa good.  cocktails excellent.  Most helpful staff ever. Setting is beautiful, right on the beach (rare in portugal).  Would be nice to have all pools heated out of season, but this wasnt a major problem.  Classic room excellent, so no need to upgrade.  Bed huge and comfortable.  Baths large and showers powerful.  Good five star hotel that ticks all the boxes."
Apr 2014,40,Great Complex,"We stayed here as a family of 4 for a week 11th-18th April. Had a great holiday. More 4 star then 5 star but we guessed that before going from the reviews and pictures. Breakfast is great. Everything you could possibly want. Evening meal great also. We were half board and enjoyed every meal. Plenty of choice. Despite some reviews that say otherwise, there is an outdoor heated pool which was plenty warm enough and even the none heated pools were ok at around 20 degrees outside temperature. Room was lovely. 2 bathrooms in suite overlooking the entrance/car park but we didn't pay for sea view so expected this. The spa facilities are 15 euros a day not an hour to use. Steam room, sauna, indoor pool etc. Gym was free to use. You get free beach toweks to use which is great. Saves taking any with you. Would definitely recommend and will go again at same time of year. Went on a jeep safari whilst there. It was superb. Booked it at the shop outside intermarche in santa eulalia shopping area. Bargain at 25 euros an adult. Great day out. Food and drink more reasonable at beach cafe and bar even though run by hotel. Hotel is expensive for drinks and snacks."
Apr 2014,40,Ten days at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort and Hotel Spa,"Spent 10 days at this hotel as part of a very large group of 160 people.  The hotel is very attractive once inside, and the staff were especially pleasant.  Although I had not paid the extra, I was allocated a very large room on the entrance floor, which to my surprise had a part sea view, and was opposite some lovely greenery, shrubs and trees.   I also had a view of the tennis courts.    Meals were provided within our group at a beach-facing restaurant, on two levels, and getting there presented some difficulties as one of our party could not manage the numerous steps, and the hotel had a wheelchair which we had to keep for the entire stay, as the room provided was at the end of the corridor, and was in fact a small suite, with two rooms, and two bathrooms.   The carer had to sleep on a sofa bed and did not take too kindly to the same.    Assistance was essential to get this wheelchair to the restaurant our group utilised.However, the hotel swimming pools and general pool areas were excellent and we had very good weather for most of the stay and the warmer heated pool was kept busy.   There were lifts to get down to the pool but for those with very small children, access to the beach was very difficult indeed.  The beach itself is beautiful - lots of golden sand - but no sunbeds or umbrellas.  There was a day with some rain, but not for long and once the rain stopped, everything dried up quickly and everyone was at the pool area again.Portugal does not appear to have a health and safety system and there were no hand rails for the numerous slopes and steps to get to the beach restaurant, which was always open at lunchtime.   The hotel runs a complimentary shuttle bus several times a day to and from Albufeira town - both to the new town and the old town.  No one ever got off or on in the new town, but the old town was a real tourist centre with numerous shops and stalls, selling every kind of item.  A short walk under a tunnel brought you to the beach.  Even though this was mid-April, the place was busy and buzzing.   The journey was about 15 minutes.The only matter I would mention was that the carpet in my room needed to be replaced.  All other hotel services seemed to be good and the only reason I have given this hotel four stars and not five is the lack of hand rails for the outside steps/stairs, and the need to deal with the bedroom carpet.The hotel is situated in a slightly isolated position, quite a good stroll to the front gate, and with cobblestones - much the same as in Albufeira town itself.  Even if you did walk out to the front gate, the nearest shops were at least 20 minutes walk away.    However, most guests seemed to come for just a few days to relax.There is a very beautifully appointed spa and heated indoor swimming pool in the basement with a large and well equipped gym which some of our group enjoyed.  The swimming pool was not free here and cost 15 euros for 90 minutes.If this group wanted to go back to this hotel, I would be very happy to join them again."
Apr 2014,50,Great,"Great Location and Hotel, stayed with two kids 9 and 10 years old. Fantastic breakfast and clean pools and rooms. Great staff. Great room two bathrooms, Fridge and TV's. Fantastic Value the breakfast was worth the money on its own. Would reccomend to any one."
Apr 2014,30,Nice but not 5 star,"Having spent a few days away with my friend, we had a relaxing, enjoyable break. But I do feel a little disappointed with our hotel. We arrived to find our suite was a golf buggy ride away from the hotel, which wasn't up to 5 star standard, orange and green decor with a cheap kitchen area. We asked to be moved to the hotel where we chose our alternate option of a standard twin room. It faced the car park at front of building, but we preferred this to being quite far away from the hotel. Breakfast was nice although we had to queue every morning due to being busy and possibly poorly managed. Pool area is nice with lovely views of nearby beach. A free bus to the beach in the old town is offered during the day, a taxi ride at night to old town is about 8 euros. Lots to do there, shops, restaurants, lovely beach, child friendly activities also on offer surrounding the beach.  My overall opinion; hotel reception area lovely, friendly staff, lovely spa area, nice pool and pool bar with tasty snacks, nice breakfast, rooms not so good, would I return to this hotel? I enjoyed myself, the hotel is ok but nothing to shout about, so probably not!"
Apr 2014,10,definitely not a five star resort by UK/USA standard more like two star,"Be careful not to assume that the images on the website reflect the apartments as they are a very different standard to the main hotel! We contacted reception 3 times, agreed to meet with general manager but he didn't turn up or was unavailable, eventually contacted us on the last day as we suspected when the holiday was over! Wrote to Hotels4You (booking agency) first few days and explained that images on website did not reflect the apartment provided, management of the hotel blamed booking agency for over selling the room and showing incorrect images. Room was more like a Formula One/Travelodge, I don't have a problem, but when you are paying top dollar and it says its a five star resort you would expect different. The facilities described as inclusive were not, the indoor pool (outside pool 7 degrees celsius), sauna, jacuzzi and steam rooms  etc were at an extra cost (£15 per hour) which was also misleading and would fall foul of the trade description act in the UK. Please really think twice about this resort if you are looking for a four/five star apartment as the management will not respond to your requests, though the cleaning staff were great, and the web descriptor will mislead you, very disappointing."
Apr 2014,40,Fabulous holiday,"Stayed in this beautiful hotel for 5 nights in April 2014 with husband and 2 teenage children. We were blessed with lovely weather everyday; highs of 22 degrees but felt warmer on the beach, particularly when there was no wind. Water was a bit chilly but you soon get used to it!  Had a lovely 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom suite overlooking the pool area and gardens with a sea view. There was a sofa bed which was reasonably comfortable but the double bed was a bit too firm for my taste - I would consider taking a mattress topper next time. Suite did not have tea/coffee making facilities but I was reliably informed that kettles are are available on request and there are several nearby supermarkets where you can buy supplies if needed. I had several cups of tea with my breakfast every morning and that was enough for me. I would highly recommend  staying on a bed and breakfast basis as the breakfasts are epic! Full English fry ups, omelettes, pastries, cakes, rolls, bread, cheeses, cereals, pancakes,fruit,champagne and juice galore, starting at 7am and lasting until 10.30am. There are 3 pools (2 are heated) with plenty of sun loungers and umbrellas available, though I imagine it might get a bit crowded in the summer when the hotel is full. The poolside bar quite expensive but that was no surprise. We did not try the gym (free) or the spa (expensive) but they looked good. The beach is accessible through a private gate for hotel guests but could prove a bit tricky to get to for less able guests as there are plenty of steps to negotiate. It is not a private beach but it was not crowded. The beach cafe (run by the hotel ) was lovely and quite reasonably priced. There is another restaurant (not run by hotel ) further down the beach which we did not try but I will definitely give it a go on our next trip. There is a free hotel shuttle bus that runs back and forth to Albufeira every 2 hours until 6:15 pm. It only seats 27 people so don't leave it until the last minute to join the queue! Taxis to and from Albufeira are about 7.50 euros each way. We will definitely go back to Grande Real Santa Eulalia for another (longer) stay and will probably hire a car to explore the beautiful Algarve region further. By all accounts, April, May, September and October are good times to go. You get good weather and reasonable prices but avoid the crowds."
Apr 2014,50,lovely hotel,"Ground floor garden room 11 with lovely views of pine trees and sea, didn't pay any extra for it. 6.50 for tuna sandwich which was nice and fresh and 4.50 for a large beer at pool bar.  Dont eat in Martins Restaurante at the hotel entrance had the worst meal ever there. Ordered chicken piri piri and got a piece of fried chicken, dried up no taste and string fries, staff attitude was really bad. Breakfast in hotel was really good and best value. Used mini bar fridge for our water etc. Taxi to nearest supermarket and restaurant is 4 euros.  Shuttle bus was really handy used it every day.  All in great hotel and location."
Apr 2014,30,be careful,this is a lovely resort but be careful while walking  as the path ways are all cobbles it is also far out and if you have any mobilty ptoblems this isnt the hotel for you there is  a mini bus that  runs hourly  but only hold 17 passengers  and at peak times for the size of the hotel only leaves the the choice of walking or  using taxis  there is a local bus stop at the gates of the complex  but again if you have mobility problems  its a bit of a walk  the taxis arnt too expensive but  the cost soon mounts up
Apr 2014,50,Probably best hotel been to.,Stayed here for five nights romantic getaway. Very good all round. Quiet room overlooking the gardens.  Food very nice and wide choice.  All staff really good and helpful. Private beach is FAB. Good for children and adults alike . Taxis €5 into main Albafeira. Will probably return next year.
Apr 2014,50,"Amazing, beautiful 1st class hotel","We are just back from this hotel travelled from 9th April - 16th April we had room 139 & also parents in room 141 double sea view suites ( paid slightly more but worth every penny ).When we arrived at hotel we were amazed at how beautiful it was , deserves all the 5 stars it is awarded in some european counties stars dont always mean much but in portugal they do.We were so please that we had 2 double beds and 2 bedrooms and usually when we travel we have a sofa bed whilst r two kids have the main bedroom so were totally over the moon to have this and 2 balconies and 2 beautiful bathrooms one of which had a fantastic whirlpool bath that i used with a nice glass of red in the evenings.Lovely soft dressing gowns and towels were waiting for us and i can honestly say i have never had a towel as soft before. There was a large bottle of water and some smarties left for kids arriving which i thought was a very nice touch, plenty of toiletries were left and replenished through the break which i thought was very kind.Rooms cleaned everyday and fresh towels if required , could also get towels for pool from reception this is fab saves on worrying about extra luggage weight for beach towels.This hotel is an amaxing location right on beach 2 minutes and your on it, we had lovely weather when we were there which made it even more perfect.We were on a b&b basis and i can honestly say best breakfasts i have ever experienced abroad and anyone that says you can get fed up with it well what do you want? there is everything from full frys, beautiful fruit selections, croissants pastries, hams, cereals, yoghurts, toast, eggs cooked to likings, boiled poached, scrambled fried everything fruit juices coffee , teas (tetley) hot chocolate for children fab service at breakfast very efficient.Only thing that would have made my stay better would have been a mattress topper both us and parents found the beds to be very hard my husband has had back surgery and step father has a dengenerative bone problems we did find it hard. We slept but did wake sore , but it was fine it would not put me off coming back at all.The hotel offers shuttle services to new town and old town with children and parents we did prefer the old town lots of character and shops just a different atmosphere.There is a kids club which one of my daughters went to i didnt send my other one as she has special needs , they are very good with children my daughter only went for an hour / hour and half most days but really enjoyed it and its free.There is a very well equipped gym which is free and the spa i did not try it so can comment on it , seemed expensive but if you want a treat then perfect for it.There could have maybe been more entertainment at night for children but again you cant have everything.Pool bar was expensive i thought 3 euro for tin of juice for kids and 4.50 for a large beer but bring your own kids juices save some £££ s thats what i did.  We used heated pool which was fine in size but just be aware dip to deep level 1.5 meters in middle , there are baby pool if u have a toddler. plenty of sunbeds and grass area to lie on. We might try apartments next time so can cook with kids as eating out in portugal in some places is not that cheap although you can get lunch for 5 euro in lots of places but the drinks add on.I would like to thank hotel and staff as they do an amazing job , felt very safe beautiful environment and will defo return next year"
Apr 2014,50,Amazing Place,"This hotel was fantastic. Staff were great, No loud music, Most pools were heated, Lovely beach. I had a great sleep but my father, who slept in the bigger room, said his sleep quality wasn't great and there were occasions where he didn't get any sleep at all.    I didn't go to the spa or have breakfast here because I went self catering but I had a look  online and the prices weren't exactly cheap.   Location was great. There is a free bus service into the strip and the old town. If you want to go to the strip get off the bus at the first stop and walk along the road (left) untill you get to it. It isn't far.    I highly recommend staying here as it is absolutely beautiful (even though other reviews say it's old fashioned) and it was, in general, a very pleasant stay."
Apr 2014,40,Great Hotel!,"Hotel is very clean and staff are friendly enough. There are hotels that are located better, but if you are looking for a holiday where you just want to chill on a beach or by pool then this hotel is ideal. There is a bus that runs to both towns, quite infrequent but a taxi isn't expensive either. my room was nice enough, nice personal touch on arrival with milk and water provided and sweets as they were expecting my toddler. Don't go for room 464 (self catering suite) if you want to use th balcony as it is very tucked away and so very shady. I didn't eat there so cant comment on the food. a very large complex, direct assess to a lovely beach and many pools so I don't imagine would feel very cramped even at th busiest times, but was very quiet when I went. all in all a pretty nice hotel!"
Apr 2014,50,Another excellent stay,Once again we have just thoroughly enjoyed a 3 night break at the Grande.Stayed 27th to 30th March as a birthday treat made all the special by the hotels lovely gesture of a bottle of Cava upon returning to our room.Have tonight booked a 4 night stay and fly out again 25th May as missing it already and will be joined by our youngest daughter and friend.
Mar 2014,50,Fantastic holiday,"We arrived at the hotel (by Yellow Fish Transfers which were excellent and easy to book online) and were really pleasantly surprised in how luxurious the resort was. The reception and seating areas really are grand and we were driven round to our apartment on a buggy! The reviews on here gave a glowing report but I still didn't know what to expect. We had a groundfloor one bedroom apartment with spacious outside area- it would be great to go with a group and stay in the neighbouring apartments as 3 shared the same outside area, complete with table, comfy chairs and sun lounger. The bed was HUGE! The cot was already set up next to the bed and everyday the cleaners would fold the sheets and even his little pyjamas! The apartment had basic kitchen facilities (2 ring electric hob, microwave, kettle,  coffee maker, sink, fridge- so had to be creative with meals- lots of crockery and pans) but it was all clean and the apartment was ideal. I would recommend you take a few essentials ie tea/ coffee, washing up liquid/ cloth and/ or head straight to the intermache to get supplies as we didn't until the next day and couldn't even have a cuppa in morning! It is a walk to the shop and if you have a little one like us- don't leave your buggy behind as it was a struggle with heavy bags and 2 yr old who wanted to be carried!! The rest of hotel was fab- we took advantage of the 50% off week for spa treatments and enjoyed reflexology, sports massage and had my nails done. Nearly all the staff speak fluent English which helped as I knew no Portuguese! The cafe on the beach was great too. Very reasonable. Everywhere we went the staff and people in general were so friendly and gave special attention to our boy. The beach was amazing too. I imagine in high season the hotel will be extremely busy- it was just perfect for us with our son. The weather was quite amazing to for this time of year- we went for a week from 20th March. The lady at the kids club was great too and our boy loved the slide (more than the well equipped play room).The free bus trip to the old town is a must- it was beautiful. We perused the shops then had a lovely fab meal at Cabana Fresco restaurant on the corner- amazing service and amazing food. Celebrating our anniversary we thought we'd go for something special and it certainly was. They were great with our boy too.Back at the hotel we were surprised with a gift from the hotel to celebrate our anniversary which was an amazing touch we felt very lucky!Thank you to the hotel for a special holiday. We will be emailing them personally and hope to return with family."
Mar 2014,40,Good choice,"Before coming here I did a very extensive search for a good hotel. I feel that I made the perfect choice. We stayed in the apartment, on our arrival we got chauffeured off to our apartment !Luggage was brought us!Apartment was very big with loads of space. Rooms are a lil out dated but still do-able!!Two bathrooms a large bed in the big room these were a lil noisey but ok. Beautiful location situated on the beach we loved it.Service was good nice breakfast. Dinner was okay!Albuferia in general not much to do or u gotta travel very far!!!All in all a good hotel and better then the rest!!!!"
Mar 2014,50,Relax and enjoy,"We have just returned from here, sadly. This is a fabulous place. Peaceful. I think some reviewers have missed its most important attribute, that it’s a spa. Everything here is designed to help you relax, and we did. You don’t need to use the spa itself to appreciate the beautiful surroundings, the beach, the pools, the rooms, the public areas. It's all about kicking back.We were so happy here and so sad when we left. There are niggles – but they’re only niggles and meant nothing overall. This place is superb. The staff are superb. The experience is superb. We are planning our return. Thank you for teaching us that it’s possible to switch off."
Mar 2014,50,A Wonderful Break At A Wonderful Hotel,"My partner and I have just returned from a much needed break at this fabulous hotel. All staff are very friendly and very attentive but not intrusive. We stayed on a half board basis and the food was very good. The breakfast buffet contained everything from yoghurt's to cereals to fruit and full cooked breakfast and much more besides. All very fresh too. Our first evening meal was a'la carte, it was it was very nice and beautifully presented. The rest of the week was a buffet, again lots of choice, meat, fish and pastas. there were many sweets and also a fine array of cheese and biscuits.We had a classic room which overlooked the car park but we had asked for a sunny balcony which we got. Should we return we would request a sea view room. Having said that, the room was immaculate and spacious. Toiletries were available for use in the bathroom. We found the beds a little too hard and very noisy when you turned over, however this did not stop us sleeping. The hotel is spacious and well maintained throughout.The bar staff staff were very friendly and the cocktails were superb. There is also a cafe bar which overlooks the beach. We spent many hours here throughout the week either having lunch or just taking in the fabulous view over a Martini or two. It is definitely a 5* establishment and 5* prices do follow but in my opinion it was well worth it, the quantity and quality was excellent.The hotel is right on a small beach which is beautiful. There is a courtesy bus which stops at ""The Strip"" and ""The Old Town"" if you would like a little meander around.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a quiet relaxed break in beautiful surroundings.A big thank you to your excellent staff for a great weeks holiday."
Mar 2014,50,Classy hotel,"This hotel has a 5 star feel from the moment you enter the gates.Reception staff are helpful and try to assist if they can (however their knowledge of bus schedules isn't the best)Rooms are spacious, clean and with flat screen TV. Bathroom huge with great power shower. Toiletries supplied also. We requested a kettle and this was delivered within 30 mins.Breakfast buffet was good but repetitive even for 1 week. Didn't eat at night.Bar is good and cocktails excellent, prices not cheap but it's 5 star service remember,Pool area is gorgeous but pools are small so in summer could be an issue but in March was loads of room and many sunbeds available.Location was handy for strip and you can walk to old town in 30-35 mins. It was idyllic in the evening with little or no noise whatsoever.If the price was right again I would return but only for a week as I found albufeira easily covered in 1 week."
Mar 2014,50,Stunning view,"We recently stayed at the sister hotel in Olhao and were really impressed, so had high hopes for my birthday weekend at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia late January.We weren't disappointed, the hotel IS really quite grand, and definately five star!The huge reception area is beautifully decorated with plenty of seating areas. At reception we wanted to upgrade to a sea view and were offered to be shown several rooms to decide which we'd prefer, which was a lovely touch. We opted for a sea view room (well worth the extra), but didnt bother with the upgrade to the suite (which wasn't). Check in took quite a while for some reason but the staff were helpful and friendly.Our room, again beautifully decorated, as was the separate bathroom. The bed was comfortable and the room very quiet despite being very near to reception. We were able to use the free wi-fi with no issues.The reception has a bar in the corner surrounded by walls made out of windows to make it separate. The bar also leads onto the terrace to give you a stunning view, right next to the sea, absolutely perfect. The terrace has lots of tables and comfy sofas to while the evening away on. Bar prices on a par with 4/5 star hotels in England. Bar staff were great, attentive and full of information on where to eat/not to eat etc, which was very useful as it was out of season and many restaurants were closed for the winter. Evening dinner in the restaurant was ok, good but nothing special but wasn't overpriced either so not a bad option if you dont want to go into town. Breakfast though was very good. From the restuarant you can walk out to the small beach directly in front of the hotel, where there is also a small snack bar. It's not a private beach but because it's out of the way it's not busy so feels private.I would absolutely recommend this hotel, I really liked it. I will be coming back to Portugal next winter, and will have to decide whether I stay here again or back to the sister hotel in Olhao which was equally as good (and with a similar stunning view)Well done to the Hotels Real chain"
Mar 2014,50,Get away from it all,"Really impressed with this Hotel and all its facilities. Hotel and room very clean and well maintained and had everything we needed for our stay . Great location , virtually on the beach and within easy walking distance to ""The Strip"". There was also a courtesy bus which the Hotel operated and dropped us off in either the New Town or in Old Town."
Mar 2014,30,Improve F&B to be better in line with hotel.,"Great entrance to the hotel. Big and spacious lobby. Friendly reception staff. Bit outdated room. Very rich breakfast buffet. Same restaurant used for dinner, unfortunately without any atmosphere during dinner time. Quality of dinner not in comparison to 5* hotels. Service lobby/bar not very attentive. Bartender talking with colleagues and not interested in taking orders. Garden well maintained and beautiful sea view."
Mar 2014,50,Beautiful,Stayed here for a week out if season at the start of March. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Would not say that this is a hotel for bringing kids to out of season as there is not much going on. We stayed in a self catering apartment and it was beautiful. There are 4 pools dotted around the resort with up to 4 heated in summer although only one was heated when we were there. Lovely beach right in front of the hotel with access from the front of the hotel. The reception staff were very friendly and a credit to the hotel. Cleaners were excellent with apartments cleaned from top to toe daily. Free bus into ' the strip' or old town 3/4 times daily. Would think this could get overbooked during the summer but not a problem out of season. Thalassotherapy spa looked nice but it is is quite expensive for treatments. Thoroughly enjoyed this place and would love to go back in summer however I don't think I could afford to. Excellent.
Mar 2014,50,Simply Stunning,"We stayed at the grande real in October 2013 for 4 nights. It was amazing from start to finish. The weather was beautiful so when we pulled up to the hotel on the coach you could see the glittering sea fromthe big glass windows, everyone on the coach was so jealous.We walked into reception and it was very nice - beautiful views of the sea. It was too early to check in so we went to the pool bar for a beer and wine - not cheap but not expensive, good quality though. There is also a bar with a rooftop that you walk out to from the bar by reception - also an indoor bar. There is direct access to the beach and there is a lovely little bar/eatery on the way down - very cheap there.The rooms were gorgeous - we went for a double with sea view. Lovely big room, big balcony and lovely big bathroom. Very comfortable room and definitely 5 star standard.Only little niggle is that the two swimming pools (one heated one not - which is fab) are just a bit on the small side and not really for swimming. But absolutely PERFECT for relaxing on the sunbed by the pool with a cold drink - never ever had a problem getting a bed.The spa is stunning.The communal areas are all spotless and impressive.The hotel put on a free bus service going into the old town - I fully appreciate this is a free service but at times we queued for 15 mins and could not get on the bus - the bus is quite small - they should get a bigger bus to be fair as I know it's free but you are still setting people's expectations by offering free service. That's the only negative I can say - but if you queue early enough you will get a spot on the bus - just the last evening bus (bout half 6pm) that is v popular.This hotel is well worth every single penny!  - oh and fab location - 15 min walk to the strip and from there you can get a street train or taxi to old town. Or .... a taxi to old town is only around 6 euro or 3 euro to the strip."
Mar 2014,30,average belated honeymoon,The hotel had maintenance on when we arrived we chose to go upgrade our room to a suite at an extra 40 euros - we could still see and hear the maintenance work our room wasn't great - it still had a little crack in the wall - in my standards this wasn't good enough!We choose to go half board - the restaurant was nice and the waiters were very friendly however for a 5 star hotel the menu was very limited and after 5 nights it was very repetitive- the soup of the day was the same soup every night (although it was very nice after the 2nd night bit bored) ( i cant eat melon and other things as im allergic - but soup of the day ended up as the soup of the week. The spa pool that was shown by our holiday company as free is 15 Euro per person for an hour and the out side pool although we were in Feb the weather was 14 oc and it was meant to be heated was freezing.The shuttle bus to albufaria centre is very good though- we tipped the driver 8 euros for 5 days worth of shuttle.My husband and i booked to use the tennis courts at a certain time and the staff had let them out to others so we had to cancel our booking at short notice which angered me as we then had to play the next day - again this was a charge of 10 euros which from a 5 star you would again think its part of the facilities.Location was beautiful and i would love to return just for that- Another person mentioned that the hotel took money unexpectedly from her account they did this to me and my husband as well 200 pounds worth with out telling us - and took 7 days after being at home  to be returned - to the point my husband and i argued typically what have i been buying again when it turned out to be the hotel.As a whole the drinks here are very expensive at the hotel - my husband and I got a 6 euros ticket each so we could have any drink at our dinner time as it was like 4 euros just for a coke at other times so we got drinks in the end from the town and brought it back to the hotel to save money.The resort transfer to and from the airport by the shuttle company was fast and efficient but that was run by shuttles 4 u .I think its just very average in total and not really a 5 star hotel- we took our children to tenerife in september for our honeymoon so we went just the two of us so we could have an actual honeymoon.
Mar 2014,50,A great find,"Excellent hotel: fantastic location by the beach (get a room with the sea view), friendly and professional staff, great food, nice rooms. Thoroughly recommended. Make sure you walk along the coast to Albufeira."
Mar 2014,50,Belated honeymoon,"We arrived in Portugal last Saturday for an 8 day stay at this beautiful resort. On arrival, we drove down with  the shuttle 'thinking of only', if only this were the place we were staying. To our delight, it was ;0) We were checked into our apartment upon arrival (about 11a.m.) as our room was ready. We had a lovely located apartment, room 463, of which the patio overlooked a pool. The apartment was bright, brightly coloured tiles in the kitchen and bathroom. The bathroom has slabs of granite in place of tiles on the shower walls, a nice touch. The apartment is well equipped with crockery, towels and robes. As it was our belated honeymoon, in celebration of it, we were given a bottle of bubbly and a plate of fruit, which was beautiful. Also, on my birthday, we returned to the apartment in the evening to find another bottle of bubbly and a cake, which truly rounded off a beautiful day. A stag party arrived on the Friday night, a group of 11, after a complaint from us and others, they were swiftly dealt with and moved. No problem again. A very swift response by the hotel.I also had a massage at the Spa on the first full day. Whilst not cheap, it was a very nice massage and the spa area looks beautiful.You can walk into the old town of Albufeira along the cliff/coast, dependant on low tide in parts (takes about 1hr and a half) and is most enjoyable.My only grioe would be the price of a large beer at the bar at the hotel at 4.5 euro each, but then it is a five star resort and very well earned those stars are. We didn't eat at the resort, so I can't comment on that.The maids did n excellent job in keeping our apartment clean on a daily basis.Beautiful resort, lovely staff."
Feb 2014,50,Fantastic Hotel but had a sting in the tail on my return,"Stayed at this hotel from 13th Feb to 20th Feb with my 16 year old daughter. The hotel is beautiful. We stayed in a twin room with breakfast included and could not fault anything. I requested a kettle and mattress toppers before we travelled and both were provided. The hotel is situated close to  a lovely little beach and the hotel also provides a free shuttle bus to the old town with a larger beach. Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely go back. The prices were reasonable too .All the staff were helpful and polite( apart from the Lady who worked in the bar could have smiled a bit lol ) No entertainment at all so nothing to do in the evenings and too far to walk anywhere at night.   HOWEVER, BEWARE.....today 26th feb, I found out that they had taken a 500 euro deposit (  £425.15) from my debit card on arrival. I was not informed of this by anyone and if I had been I would have given them a credit card not a debit card. It apparently takes approx. 5 - 7 working day before the funds are back available in my account. I feel this is something the hotel should inform you of prior to your visit or on checking in when they ask for your card. This has never happened in any other 4 or 5 star hotel I have stayed in and has really annoyed me as I feel my permission should have been given for such a large amount. This could cause some financial difficulties if you are not aware of it and haven't budgeted accordingly.This has , for me changed my view of the Real chain and not sure I would stay with them again."
Feb 2014,50,heaven,"we stayed here out of season as a family of 6. we had a double for us and twin 2 rooms for our boys. requested sea view which we got. requested rooms close by which we also got. hotel was to a very high standard. considering it was out of season and very quiet, the staff were plenty and helpful. The rooms were of a high standard and comfortable. well equipped. the spa was wonderful. I had 2 treatments and the staff again were superb.the balcony for sunbathing was well equipped and very comfortable. service was excellent. lunch by the pool was lovely and access to the beach was superb. lovely beach. nice places along the front to choose from for lunch. I cant praise the hotel and staff enough. was probably one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in for a while. the town itself was awful. didn't like Portugal as a hole. lots of bars and restaurants but no local food. might have been due to it being out of season but felt like blackpool. if you want a relaxing and luxurious stay in the sun and don't want to go far then this hotel is a must. pools a bit small and crowded which could be not so good in season but otherwise wonderful."
Feb 2014,40,Excellent beach front hotel for the family,"Wonderful views and a well appointed room make this a very comfortable location for a family friendly holiday. A short walk to the local town centre and the mutlple bars and rstaurants although a short taxi ride is required for Albufeira town. Staff are excellent and very attentive and the morning buffet offers more than enough choices, the pools are very good and the gardens well tended, the only fault we could find was the pool cues needed chalk...not too much wrong in other words. The spa was very good and the gym more than up to the task."
Feb 2014,30,not sure this is 5 star,"Whilst this time of year may be considered out of season, we did expect a five star establishment, to have more than one dining facility available. No evening entertainment, even a pianist playing during dinner would be something. This hotel is situated a distance from any shops, but does not offer any facilities for provisions, although it has self catering apartments. The one shop on site, selling newspapers is not open on Sundays."
Feb 2014,50,Awesome!!!,"We had apartaments with kitchen and sitting area, large bed and balcony. That was the best stay in our life!!! Hotel is amazing and all staff is friendly and always smiling! Everywere was very clean and tidy. A lot of swimming pools and the beach is few steps from the hotel. There was free bus to Albufeira town and back. Breakfast is very Very good! There was everything for everybody and so tasty...Meal is amazing!Very relaxed atmosphere. Everything taken care of.Than was our paradise!!!Thanks again,Natalja."
Feb 2014,50,Nice hotel!,This is a nice hotel with very spacious rooms. We stayed in a sea view suite and the view was lovely. They have some nice cocktails in the bar. We decided to go with half-board option (they serve buffet in the restaurant) and had variety of foods. They arrange free transfers from/to the hotel to the old town (which is only 15 minutes drive). There are several restaurants in the old town and for much cheaper.
Feb 2014,50,Perfect Base for a 5 Star Albufeira Experience,"I stayed here in the last week of August (in the hotel) with a friend of mine for a bit of R and R.  We booked directly with the website which offered us the following benefits:Early check inLate check outRoom upgrade if availableFruit and water in the room10% discount in restaurantsRoomOn arrival we were upgraded to a ground floor suite with jacuzzi and direct access into the gardens which was fantastic!  The room was huge and perfect for 2 girls with large wardrobes!! We did have an issue when we requested an iron as the only ""rent"" them for 24 hours even though I only needed it for 5 minutes.  Also it was such an old iron and ironing board it nearly damaged my dress.  I can't believe they charge for it!!  At least have up to date equipment.  Also the TV was outdated but we were not in the room much to watch TV anyway.Hotel and GroundsThe hotel has 3 pools. 2 for adults and one for toddlers which is heated.  Although small they never got too busy and there was always sunbeds to be found when required.  Each set of apartments / houses also has it's own pool.  The walk down to the beach is fabulous and you need to swipe your key to get down to the beach, passing the beach restaurant on the way down.  The beach charges for beds and umbrellas which was a pain but if you go down after 2pm you may get away with not being charged or they only charge you a nominal fee.  Having to pay restricted our days at the beach and I usually prefer the beach to the pool.  The beach was lovely so it was worth it and you also tended to get less families down at the beach (ie less screaming kids!)Food & DrinkBreakfast was fantastic, everything you could possibly need so we filled up at breakfast in the morning which saw us through until dinner.  Be aware however that a queue starts to develop within 30 minutes of breakfast closing time.  You could be in the queue for 15 minutes.We never ate in the buffet in the evening but one evening we tried the restaurant down at the beach which was amazing! 10% discount off this meal was handy as it was not cheap.  We walked into town most evenings which is only a 20 minute walk and a nice way to work up an appetite before eating.Staff / Activities All staff were very friendly especially the 2 guys who ran the daily activities ie aqua aerobics, pilates.  There is a weekly programme of activities that were free and we made good use of them.  Each day the spa also offers discounted rates on treatments but be sure to book early.  I got a manicure for 50% off on one of the days.  The gym was small but has most things you need and was never busy.SummaryAll in all I really enjoyed my time here and would recommend for anyone looking for a relaxing 5 star break in the Algarve. It is very popular with Portuguese so not too many English and Irish in the resort but all staff spoke perfect English."
Feb 2014,50,5 star Hotel,"We have just returned from a weeks stay at this hotel (Feb 2014).The hotel in in a gated complex with very pretty grounds ,with direct access to the beach. On our arrival the reception staff were friendly , smiley and very informative.Our room did overlook the front so we were near the carpark but this did not affect us at all. The entrance to the hotel is lovely, and a great quiet place to sit and read.We booked bed and breakfast, and what a breakfast, !!!! everything you could possibly think of or indeed want, excellent service and cleanliness, we did not need anything else all day as you can eat as much or as little as you need.There is a free shuttle bus to the nearby town, but we found it scruffy and uninviting, although appreciate it was very quiet due to the time of the year.we have really enjoyed our stay and would recommend, as now feeling very chilled and relaxed."
Feb 2014,20,very average,"Maybe this hotel is nice if you are going for holiday with your family but if you re on business - no. Internet connection worked very badly if it worked at all. My room was overlooking the carpark, the bed was very hard and the room very dark with old furnitures. The pools are very small and to get a sunchair was something to dream about"
Feb 2014,50,outstanding,"just come back from the grand the hotel was outstanding well looked after ,the grounds were excellent ,the staff outstanding could not do enough made you really welcomewe had a apartment loads of space for the two of us,  were immaculate  bed made every day even though we were self catering food was great freshly cooked ate nearly every day  at the seaside café good value prices were greatwas well deserving of its five star rating"
Feb 2014,50,Fantastic,"We have just returned from a seven day holiday, staying at this superb beach front five star hotel.  It really lives up to its five stars.  We paid extra to have a sea view hotel room which was well worth it.  You could actually hear the crashing waves of the Atlantic from your room.  The rooms were very spacious, and we found the huge bed to be very comfortable. The check-in was quick, friendly and efficient.  All the staff spoke very good English. We were half board and have to say the breakfasts were fantastic, anything you can think of for breakfast was there, even cava!  The fresh fruit was a real highlight, fresh (not tinned) pineapple, kiwi, oranges, grapefruit, grapes. Pears, apples, melon... The list goes on.  The evening dinners were also superb, with top quality food including steak, rack of lamb, sea bass, Piri Piri chicken, algarvian prawns,etc all served up  perfectly.  The waiter service was excellent too. The hotel entrance is gated and there is access to the beautiful Santa Eulalia beach via steps directly from the hotel, though you need your room card to pass through the gate.  The beach front cafe is a lovely spot to enjoy a drink or a meal.  There is also a courtesy bus to take you to either the Old town or new Town of Albufeira which we used a few times. The swimming pools looked lovely but were too cold for us to be tempted with a dip!  The bar is spacious and friendly, also with ocean views.  Everything has been well designed to make full use of the superb beach front.  We had a fantastic holiday and are already looking to return as soon as we can.  Cannot recommend this hotel highly enough,  thank you for a wonderful holiday,"
Feb 2014,40,Magnificent hotel and setting,"We just spent a week at this beautiful hotel. A really beautiful hotel, beautiful foyer and marvellous proportions. Our room was a classic facing the car park, if you can go for the view on the seaside, the view is spectacular. Also if you have a choice take the half board, the food was very very good and it's too far out of town to walk down for all meals. The breakfasts are sumptuous and the staff are lovely. I found the bed and pillows to hard but they will change these for you so just ask early in holiday. As I say the staff are very nice, there is a small shop with excellent value. We had a fabulous day trip to Seville, a long day but well worth it, as it happens, it was my birthday and when we returned they had delivered free wine and a birthday cake to our room, it was a really lovely surprise, how kind!"
Feb 2014,40,Good but could be much better ,"We stayed at the hotel over the new year.  On arrival at the hotel check in was efficient,and the reception staff welcoming. Our room had a garden /sea view which was very pleasant. The room was extremely clean and well presented. Now for the problem. If you don't like firm beds don't stay here.  We requested mattress toppers when booking but didn't get one,  we asked at reception who informed housekeeping and although they did provide some padding it wasn't effective. The poor sleep and muscle pain was rectified to some degree by spa treatments every day. Now for the food. Buffet breakfast was adequate with everything you could ask for so no complaints there. The evening ala carte meal in the main restaurant was at best average but to be honest typical hotel standards. The cafe bar over looking the beach had stunning views, and was a great place to spend an hour or so. It just a shame the food wasn't in the same league. The bar staff were faultless and served top end cocktails at reasonable prices. Now for the million dollar question would I come back.  Yes if the beds were softer."
Jan 2014,50,Excellent hotel.,What can i say from the moment we arrived it has been a great stay! We stayed in a 1 bedroom apartment facing the pool which was well equipped with all we needed. Got like 5 pools in total and great beach. Breakfast was great everyday with very friendly staff. Got a kids club with different activities everyday which is great for families. Room service is excellent and they even washed up things we forgot. Reception staff are very helpful too. Room service menu seem a bit expensive but prices on the coffee shop near the beach is very reasonable and they do great selection of food all day till 5pm. Free shuttle service for the old town was great too. Great stay and we will come back for sure. Only 20 min cab ride away from Vilamoura marina which will cost you around €16. Only recommendation will be to have some coffee and sugar in the apartments rather than free toiletries since everyone remembers to bring that but need a coffee soon as you arrive after your flight.....Would recommend to stay if your coming to Algarve...very clean...great hotel. Sad to be going back tomorrow.
Jan 2014,50,Fantastic hotel,"We booked a one week getaway in January, and I cannot fault this hotel in any way. The staff are all so attentive, every little detail is taken care off. We were in a self catering apartment and it was huge, it had everything that you could possible need. Bathrobes, free tv in the lounge and the bedroom, free safety deposit box in your room, free wi fi in your room and all over the hotel, every cooking utensil you could possible think off, toiletries replenished everyday, (shampoo, soap, shower gel etc.) hair dryer in the bathroom, we even had a telephone in the bathroom. The Hotel in huge with 3 outdoor pools and one of them is heated, a private beach, accessible through the hotel terrace. What impressed me most was a knock on the door the evening of my husbands birthday, we opened the door to find a waiter with a tray containing 2 x champagne glasses, bottle of champagne in an ice bucket, birthday cake with a candle in it and a birthday card from the hotel and staff, we had not told a soul that it was his birthday....they must of picked it up from his passport, that's a lovely gesture and made us feel special. We had a fantastic week and will certainly return later in the year"
Jan 2014,50,Excellent stay! Will definitely be going back!,"We recently came back from the Grande Real Santa Eulalia where we stayed 10 days over the New Year's period. We all had a great holiday there. The kids loved going to the kids' club and we would like to thank again the amazing, hard-working staff there (Carmen, Ana and Juan). They were brilliant with our little ones. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment and were very happy with the accommodation. It was spacious and even though the kitchenette is small it had everything we needed on holiday. The apartment was cleaned daily & thoroughly and the maid always left some lovely little touches like folding our kids' pyjamas and cuddly toys on top of their beds. Breakfast was delicious and had everything you could want: a variety of fresh fruit, variety of yogurts, different types of cheeses and cold meats, fresh fruit juices, cereals, different types of bread and pastries, branded jams & honey, ""Nutella"", lovely little portuguese cakes, sparkling wines and plenty of hot food too (eggs, bacon etc). You could have an omelette made in front of you. The perfect start to the day! The location of the hotel is fantastic. Right on the beach - which is gorgeous. We spent a lot of time with the kids there. The hotel cafe-snack bar overlooking the beach was really good for lunches and mid-morning coffee. The view was fabulous. We normally hire a car when we come to the Algarve but we didn't this time. We were happy walking to the nearest shops (10mns) or hopping in a cab if going a bit further. There is shuttle bus at the hotel, which we used twice and found handy to go to Albufeira - which isn't a particularly ""nice"" place in itself unfortunately. The spa at the hotel was good. We used the thalasso therapy pool once (It costs 15 euros per person) and we had a very relaxing time there. There is a gym which looked pretty decent for a hotel. Treatments are overall quite pricey but every day there is a promotion on a couple of treatments making them reasonable enough. The lobby is a very nice place to sit down, read a book or and have a drink. It is really spacious with high ceilings and nice furnishings. We found staff to be very professional: always helpful and discreet. We will definitely be coming back to the Grande Real Santa Eulalia. The excellent kids' club, breakfast, location & very good standards of apartments make it a perfect choice for young families."
Jan 2014,50,A superb New Year,"Had a superb 4 day break over the New Year in this hotel. Never stayed here before but last Christmas stayed in another hotel in this chain in Olhao which we really enjoyed. We were not disappointed, once again The Real chain gave us a break to remember. A special mention must go to the staff, all were superb ! Friendly, helpful and professional - a real asset for the hotel. Bed was slightly firm for us but within one hour of asking in reception for a topper it was on our bed. After that we slept much better. Best breakfast ever ! We hope to return to this hotel again next year or maybe the Real Marina in Olhao, difficult to choose as both are superb but very different in their location but for sure we will be returning."
Jan 2014,50,Excellent hotel & attention to detail,"Myself and boyfriend paid 460 to stay here HB for a week over New Year through a package company .  The hotel was a pleasure to stay in...comfortable, expansive lobby, well maintained grounds with excellent access directly to a beautiful section of beach. Easy parking outside reception. Food was plentiful, always fresh and dinners both Al a Carte and Buffet were a highlight.  Waiters were always on hand with coffee top ups and drinks even during busy breakfast times. Room cleaned and tidied daily with staff never intruding.  The room itself was the ""classis  or standard"" but there was noting else I would have wanted. It was spacious & direct access to gardens was great, bath robes provided and in my opinion very comfortable beds. The jazz entertainment and fireworks on new years eve were an unexpected bonus.  The outdoor heated pool is a nice touch in winter.  Free gym was adequate for holidays and indoor water circuit worth paying the 18E at least once! I have paid similar prices for many holidays but this is the best value and quality I have experienced to date.  As a tip Villamoura is much nicer area & better maintained than Albuferia but I would still choose to stay in this hotel and travel into Villamoura due to the high quality."
Jan 2014,50,Fantastic New Year,"Spent New Year's eve there. Located right on Santa Eulalia beach. Kids had a great time playing on the beach,the swimming pool and the kids club. Apartments good size and comfortable with enough amenities to be self-catering if you desire (but could do with some plates though!). Staff very helpful. Great spa to relax in. Excellent breakfast. Easy accessible to supermarkets and restaurants (10 minute walk). Good base to explore the Algarve from."
Jan 2014,20,A Family Hotel,My wife and I spent 5 days in this hotel last summer.Pros:- Lovely view if you are in a higher floor facing the sea;- Easy access to the public beach (the hotel doesn't have its own beach but is just 5m walking)- Nice breakfastCons:- very small pools with lots of kids and noise and you need to come very early to find a seat next to the small pool!- the furniture in the room is very old (three star hotel type)The hotel is good but surely not a 5 star standard. Don't recommend it couple looking for some quiet and relaxing time.
Dec 2013,50,Looking forward to another great stay,"We stayed at the Grande real Santa Eulalia Resort over the Easter holidays earlier this year and had a fantastic stay.  Me, my husband and 2 kids age 10 and 3.  All 4 of us loved the resort and surrounding area.  Staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast fantastic, rooms clean and comfortable.... what more do you need.  We have booked to stay again over the New Year period, we normally stay in Villamoura at New Year - but due to such a fab experience here earlier in the year, we have decided to return, taking my parents with us this time for their anniversary."
Dec 2013,50,Brilliant,"Lovely , hotel . Really special . If you left the windows open at night you can Hear the sea as it's so close , we had a direct access to the gorgeous beach.We are a small family we stayed in the hotel , which is also file for couple,s, however if you are a larger party they also have villas and apartments and they are also lovely.  The food was very good , there was one or 2 negative comments but you always get that , we found it fine and high standard. I agree with a precious suggestion , purchase the drinks package it's 6 euro I think and allows soft drinks and wine . And works out good value we thought.Getting here was easy although a bit delayed due to BA , our transfer however was still waiting for us very patiently with our name in the air and full of smiles , her name was Philipa and worked for a very efficient company called yellowfishtransferrs , she took us swiftly and carefully to the hotel I time for dinner and then bed ready to start our very enjoyable"
Nov 2013,50,Beautiful hotel and grounds. Excellent beaches ,"When we pulled up at this hotel. It was wow. It is a gated secure complex. Plenty of security cameras about. Beautiful clean rooms,  cleaned daily. Toiletries provided.  Breakfast was excellent.  got spoilt with fizz for breakfast.  Plenty of choice. Heated outdoor pool. Could do with a free indoor pool. The lack of English spoken by the staff was disappointing. It was hard to understand each other. Bus timetable for local buses would have been better in English.  free bus from the hotel is a bonus,  but a few more stops would be beneficial.  All in all an excellent place to stay."
Nov 2013,50,Travel Department trip to Albufeira,"This was an excellent holiday.  The hotel is in a beautiful location, overlooking the sea, with a bath leading from the hotel to the beach.  The hotel has a cafe overlooking the beach, a relaxing, peaceful place to have lunch and gaze at the ocean."
Nov 2013,50,exceeded expectations,"I have travelled quite extensively and am used to stay in boutique and quality hotels. Even though I knew this hotel was a five star hotel, i must admit I was very impressed with the facilities and the opulent and tasty decors within the public areas, and the different corners within the hotel settings that cater for different moods (on one's own, having drinks with friends, quiet reading area, free pcs for social media, lounging area). We stayed in the self catering unit because I am diabetes. The accomodation is spacious, clean, and the maid came in everyday and did an excellent job in cleaning the kitchen and the bathroom, giving us fresh towels as we both like a dip in the sea. The seaview is amazing and the hotel has its own private path to the beach. There is a regular free shuttle bus service to Abufeira throughout the day (until 6pm). The thalasso spa experience is out of this world. Would recommend the spa if one has got aching limbs. I would definitely go back there."
Nov 2013,50,Lovely Stay,"I stayed in the hotel part of this complex with two friends who were in a room nearby. It was a very relaxing stay. Stayed on a bed and breakfast basis. There was nothing at all wrong with the room, it was clean and comfortable, although if I had wanted to watch TV I did notice that many of the channels did not seem to work and broadcast a webcam image of what looked like Lisbon. The breakfast buffet was well stocked and had a wide range to suit all tastes. 10 minute walk to Albufeira ""new town"", a long walk to the ""old town"" but a nice walk/scramble along the beach. Without a doubt I would stay here again."
Nov 2013,50,"Nice hotel, great location.","Big hotel 30 minutes drive from Faro airport.Spread over a few acres on a very nice beach, with all the facilities expected from a 5* hotel.Large opulent public areas, all light and airy. We had a classic double with sea view,and the sea view was definately worth paying the extra supplement for. The rooms themselves are showing slight signs of wear and tear, but didnt distract from their comfort. Big (firm) beds-maybe too firm for some. Flat screen tv with not the best reception but ok to watch the news.Big balconies to enjoy the views.Bathrooms clean with large bath and shower and a range of toiletries.We took the half board option -breakfast was great, plenty of choice, but dinner a little disappointing. If you werent on the half board option and payed for dinner seperately it was 38 euros excluding drinks-expensive for a buffet.Drinks at the bar we found quite reasonable for a 5*-7 euro for a large gin and tonic,6 euro for a large glass of wine.Probably because we were well out of season the hotel seemed almost empty. Consequently it was beautifully quiet and the pool area was almost deserted throughout the day. One pool is heated, the other was cold.Albufeira is about 10 minutes drive away but Olhos D'Agua is a 30 minute pleasant walk (turn right out of main gates). Albufeira was a ghost town the one night we went there.All the staff were very pleasant and helpful.All in all a really nice break with fantastic weather whilst we were there-but was freezing the morning we left!"
Nov 2013,50,Excellent service and wonderful rooms.,"I stayed recently for 8 days with my 16 year old daughter in a Studio apartment, perfect choice !Lots of space and immaculately clean. The beds and pillows are really comfy, makes a change. Rooms and towels changed daily.  The free shuttle bus was excellent and was 20 mins into the old town. Could be full sometimes though so be prepared to jump in a taxi for about 6 euros. Pools were very clean and there was a great choice of sunbeds and free use of pool and beach towels. Beautiful sandy beach and 2 minutes walk. I would really recommend this hotel we had a great time and very relaxing."
Nov 2013,50,Sun sea sand and a quiet time,"This hotel was one of the first on this part of the coast and in a stunning location . We booked Bed and Breakfast and what a breakfast it is! Everything one could possibly want and fizz as well. The hotel is Immaculately cleaned constantly and very pleasant staff always on call.The free bus to town was a boon, and taxi to return around £7. We loved all the different levels and the 3 heated pools, the hottest almost a jacuzzi without bubbles.Very large sofa area to relax out of the sun. All marble and tiles and air conditioning. A pleasing lack of notices saying what was and what wasn't allowed Although there is a small shop and very good beach there is not a lot in this quiet relaxed atmosphere for young children as the location is removed from Albufeira.Our room with sea view had a great balcony, excellent bathroom and wonderful view.Thoroughly recommended with staff to match."
Nov 2013,50,Amazing hotel...,"This was our fourth visit and we enjoy it so much.  The location is superb, the food is great, the spa so relaxing.  Paula (the manager) and her staff do an amazing job to ensure of a relaxed, qual ity holiday, we cannot thank them enough.  Grateful thanks everyone and we will see you next year."
Nov 2013,50,A real 5 star experience,"We stayed here as a couple in a studio apartment with the intention of doing our own cooking. The first night we arrived we wandered out of the resort to find a shop not very far away and as you can imagine the cost of things was ludicrous! In the end we ordered room service most nights, we found the prices to be fairly reasonable and were very impressed by the food - the standard was very high. Our apartment was not too far away from a pool that we spent most days relaxing by, the water was pretty cold but I didn't go in there too often. The resort was stunning and everywhere you walked you were impressed by the things you saw. There was free wifi in the lobby and it was a good place to go of an evening to get some drinks and chill - we even watched the Champions League final that they set up a big screen for.We only had one problem which was on the second or third day some bugs were all over the place by our bed, the staff were very helpful and tried to sort it out with a bit of spray, but they soon realised there were too many bugs and moved us to another room - they also gave us access to the spa free of charge! We went in the spa almost every day which was brilliant as the pool was big and the various jets and jacuzzis made it a great place to be."
Nov 2013,40,Great location for a relaxing break!,"Stayed at this hotel from 24-31 October in a sea view room (325)Arrived at around 11am to the hotel and was surprised to find that our room was available so was very happy and girls at reception were very pleasant. Room - We had upgraded to a sea view room before we got there as all the reviews said it was a must. Now if i was a complaining person i may have been straight down to reception to ask to be moved as you could really only see the sea if you stood at one side of the room near the window. However as the week went on this bothered me less and less as we were at the beach all day and not really in the room that much anyway. The room was lovely and big and very clean and the only 2 things i can fault about the room is that a) to get the minibar switched on you have to order something to be put in it which you are charged for even if you dont want it and b) the double bed was 2 single beds pushed together and was a hard as a brick - i found it very uncomfortable but my partner didnt seem to mind. Oh and also for a 5 star the carpet was discoloured and a bit dingy looking.Food - We stayed on b&b basis and the breakfast was lovely, loads of choice and staff very pleasant. We also had snacks in the bar and cafe which were both satisfactory, i would recommend a bigger menu for snacks but it was perhaps small as we went off season! We were just heading out for dinner every night and we found alot of different we places within 15-20min walk. the place round the corner Martins - was lovely, staff really nice and the food and wine were excellent, we ended up going there 3 times.Spa - We used the spa on 2 occasions as the weather wasnt great and it was lovely, very relaxing and well worth doing if you get a bad day (although we had to pay €15 to use it, we didnt mind as you are not going to use it everyday)Pool area and beach - the pool area for me was a bit disappointing, although there were plenty of loungers and seats i wouldnt like to see it in the height of the summer but the beach was excellent, beautiful beach and close to the cafe if you wanted a cold drink. Water was just perfect for swimming although the waves can get a bit rough ;) the beach alone would definitly entice me to go back!Staff - as i have already said most of the staff were all very pleasant, we just had one issue with a member of staff about our beach towels on our first day. You receive cards for a towel for the beach each day and when you return your towel you get your card back for the next day. We were unsure of this and on the first day when we went to drop our towels off (around 4) there was no one there so we just left them, not knowing you had to get your cards back and the next day the guy was arguing with us that you needed a card and that we must have left yesterdays back late (which we didnt). I just asked him could we not get ones for today then and he finally gave us 2 but he couldve handled the situation a bit better. At the end of the day its a 5* hotel and i dont expect to have to argue over a beach towel!Although i have pointed out some bad points this hotel was lovely and was in a brilliant location if you are looking to relax, not much in the way of entertainment around but it was just what we were looking for. Another good point i thought was that its secured by gates and if you did want to hire a care there is plenty of parking also available. And free wifi in the hotel too.We would definitly go back and would recommend it to others."
Nov 2013,40,Luxury,"Lovely room overlooking the sea, champagne breakfast although the bacon is something to be desired the rest of the breakfast was lovely, evening meal could be a bit warmer best to get a drinks voucher costs about €6.50 per person for wine, lager and soft drinks it's about €8 for water €18 for a bottle of wine. Lovely setting love albufeira. Would definitely go back. Rooms were very clean you do have a fridge, and you can request a kettle for your room."
Oct 2013,40,Food disgusting,"Were do I start.  Went on Paul Claffey music tour. The hotel closes for the week and is only for the tour only. When we arrive both my wife and I were very impressed with the hotel had a lovely room with a sea view. We were really looking forward to our holiday, only to find we were going to be disappointed. The FOOD was disgusting this was supposed to be a 5 star hotel maybe the hotel itself but certainly not the FOOD. Wouldn't even rate the food a 2 star. After the first night of not able to eat anything we gave it the benefit of the doubt and went and on our second night it was the seem. My wife and I had to eat out the rest of the week. I went and complained to tour staff who had said they had other complaints as well. They took my other vouchers of me for rest of the week and I was told I would be refunded when we got home. Well that's another story home now three weeks and still have got nothing. Would stay clear of this hotel if you are going and expecting  5 star food you won't get it. Only one thing the entertainment organised by the tour was excellent. Won't stop till I get my refund."
Oct 2013,40,Wonderful sea views,We had a sea view room and it was just beautiful to wake up to hear the sound of waves lapping onto the beach - it's that close!  The breakfast package is well worth booking - there are loads of hot and cold choices and it even includes champagne.  We didn't book a car but taxis are very cheap - it costs around 7 euros to the centre of albufeira old town where restaurants are cheaper than the lovely but quite pricey fish restaurant on site.  The spa isn't cheap but they do half price special treatments each day and if you opt for one of those its very good value. Rooms are generally clean and spacious although the tv is not really 5 star standard. Programming is very basic with limited English channels - but you can always sit on your balcony with a glass of local rosé wine and listen to the sea instead. The pools are heated and sun beds plentiful. Service is friendly - a little laid back which suited us fine as we were there to relax not charge around. We found the room service meals not very good value. We had to wait quite a while and the food was expensive and nowhere near as good as in the restaurant. A nice touch was the complimentary fruit kebabs offered to guests during afternoons by the pool. A relaxing and peaceful hotel - good for re-charging with more action and nightlife a short taxi ride away.
Oct 2013,40,Great relaxing stay,"We arrived at the hotel around 10:30 as our flight was very early in the morning. We booked two twin rooms Julio the receptionist was great!! Managed to get us a room and 2nd room wouldn't be ready till at least 2pm. Anyway we all went up to that room to freshen up. Came back downstairs to for a bite to eat. The cafe on the beach was lovely apart from the fact I found a fly sitting at the bottom of my fresh lemon juice! When we came back inside Julio stopped us and told us out 2nd room was ready! Julio you absolute legend!! Breakfast buffet was great no complaints there, although on one occasion my friend asked for a plain omelette after having a few bites found it had pieces of bacon in it. Which was very disappointing because it is against our religion. Rooms were great apart from the fact that when we booked we asked for a beach view which we didn't get. May have been because it was off season but me and friends were the only young lads staying at the hotel the rest were OAP's. On our last day after we checked out we still had a few hours to kill before heading to the airport so decided to take advantage of the 50% off offer in the spa. All four us got a full body massage which was great!! Reception team were very helpful at all times!!"
Oct 2013,50,Superb holiday,"There were six people in our party. Myself and husband, our daughter and her husband and our two grandchildren (10yrs and 3yrs). This was the first time our grandchildren had been abroad, and the first holiday abroad for our daughter and son-in-law in 10 years.  After reading some of the reviews we were a tad sceptical regarding the beds, food etc.  On arriving at the Hotel, the reception staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. The rooms were outstanding, (rooms 211 and 215) the views from the Rooms spectacular. The beds extremely comfortable.  All staff were very friendly and a special thank you to Carmen from the Kids Club.  She was just so warm and friendly to all the children. Our grandchildren loved this experience and it gave our daughter time to relax.  The gentleman in charge of the dining room gave us a reserved table for the duration of our stay which was very much appreciated.  The food on offer for breakfast and the evening meal was outstandingly good, so much choice.  It was my grand-daughter's 4th birthday while we were staying in the hotel and the chef made her a special cake. When I offered to pay for the cake I was amazed to be informed that it was free from the Hotel with their love. I can only thank you and your staff for making our stay so memorable.  We have started to save for two weeks holiday next year.  Well done to you all and thank you again for such a wonderful time."
Oct 2013,50,Amazing wedding,My friend got married yesterday 4/10/13. Unfortunately couldn't stay in the hotel as it was booked since jan of this yr. amazing wedding. Beautiful food. Salad soup chicken and chocolate desert(words fail me on the desert) and such great service. Just such an amazing day in the hotel. Really wish we could have spent the night
Oct 2013,50,Apartment at Grande real Santa Eulalia,"We arrived late to the hotel, about 11:30pm.  Unfortunately there was a mix-up with our booking. We had booked through Hot Wire who apparently passed the booking to Expedia. I would never use Expedia as I have always found them expensive when comparing prices.  So be careful when using a little known company. I think they are popular in USA. Anyway, back to the hotel, the reception staff informed us that we were booked into an apartment, not the hotel. As we were disappointed and very tired we were given a room in the hotel the first night. The following day we were given the opportunity to stay in the hotel room (to pay an extra €15 per night) or move to the apartment. We viewed the apartment , we were very pleasantly surprised , transferred our luggage with lots of help and spent a lovely week in a Studio apartment. It was spacious , well equipped, cleaned daily, including the dishes! Lovely extras in the bathroom and towelling robes. I am so glad we chose to move , as the Hotel is basically like any other 4/5* hotel I have stayed in in a popular holiday area. This hotel and some of the apartments are quite close to the beach. This resort is big and nicely spread out. With lots of swimming pools distributed throughout.  The Spa, indoor swimming pool, Thalasso Spa and treatments were, as I have said, like any other 4/5* hotel, extremely over priced. In my opinion you are paying for the location and maybe a quieter type of clientele, we stayed 21st-28th Sept. Overall we found the staff pleasant and helpful with us and other guests."
Oct 2013,30,Overpriced and Poor Quality,"We rated it an average because although the rooms need some serious updating and a thorough cleaning (twin beds pushed together to create a queen which were hard as a rock, worn furniture, dingy carpeting, hand prints on the headboard, old tube TV and a shower curtain that should just be thrown out), the staff at the front desk was very good. They were helpful and very pleasant. In fact, they sent up to our room fruit with chocolate and champagne for our 25th anniversary. Also, breakfast was very good and the service as well. The bar next to the lobby was a nice spot for a nightcap, as the drinks were very good and the bartender was very pleasant. Unfortunately, the rooms were not worth the money spent."
Oct 2013,40,great stay,stayed 2 weeks sept..hotel very good .stayed half board .restaurant down on beach was just bril..buffet reataurant just ok..good tip if half board you must get drinks package..6euros per person for house wine water and soft drinks..ex value...wine waiter philip.was excelent..as were all staff ..stayed in one bedroom apt with a garden patio..just lovely....just one minus had to go to old town every night..hotel no entertainment.nothing ..hotel missing a trick here...
Sep 2013,50,Great hotel with direct access to a lovely beach and kids club,"Weather was shocking which made it difficult with a 3 year old boy, however, the hotel was excellent.  Kids club was excellent too and made a real difference with the weather being so bad.  Breakfast buffet was fine, pools were great, and the beach Connected to the hotel was lovely.  The pool bar was expensive and only sold cold snacks which was the only poor point.  Gym was great for a hotel and the spa was a nice extra for the wife. Gated development with parking felt secure and the one bed apartment was perfect.  Would definitely come back. Wifi was hit and miss... Good enough to watch the match if you find the right spot but drops off completely in some areas."
Sep 2013,50,Excellent hotel with direct access to a lovely beach!,"We have just returned from our first holiday in Albufeira and stayed for 10 nights at the Grand Real Santa Eulalia Resort. We chose self catering and had a Studio Resort Suite, which was well equipped and very spacious. Although we were self catered we benefitted from all of the services of a hotel that you'd expect, such as daily cleaning of the room and replenishment of toiletries etc. It was my boyfriend's birthday whilst we were away and we came back to the room following a day by the pool to a birthday cake and bottle of something bubbly, which we felt was a really nice touch! The location of the hotel was idyllic, with direct access to a beautiful beach. We were able to get a fresh towel everyday to use at the pool or the beach, which again was very useful. The staff were friendly and helpful, particularly in the pool bars, cafe atlantico and the hotel bar. There were a number of weddings whilst we were there, which supports the pretty location. There's also a free shuttle that goes into the new and old towns of albufeira, which helped reduce the reliance on taxis. On the last day the weather wasn't good, and as we had a late flight they kindly allowed us to stay in the room until 2 pm, despite a checkout time of 10 am. We finished our stay with a trip down to the spa, which was nice and very relaxing! Ultimately a lovely and very clean hotel, which offered a very comfortable break and good value for money!"
Sep 2013,40,Lovely Hotel,"Was here for just one night and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  the hotel is clean, comfortable and the staff were very helpful and diligent.  Food was excellent.  Pool side I thought was perhaps a little too tight for everyone to enjoy some space but the weather was excellent and the beach was worth sitting by instead.  there was a great sense of luxury here and I would like to go back to stay for longer sometime in the future."
Sep 2013,30,My view!,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel for one week.  Good points about the hotel are: 1. The apartment rooms are very big 2. The hotel is very clean. 3. Plenty of choice for breakfast 4. Plenty of sun beds to choose from even at 10.30 half of the beds were still empty.5. The hotel put on a free shuttle bus to the old and new town, the safes are free, wifi is free and clean towels are provided each day for the pool/beach. 6. Location was good only 10 minutes to the new town. 7. Security the hotel is very safe. You have to use your room key to get to the beach and through the front gate. Bad points about the hotel: 1. The reception staff are very rude. 2. I requested a 2nd floor apartment and got a ground floor on arrival and told me I could move the day before we were leaving! 3. No entertainment during the day or evening. They could have some music around the pool. They would have made their money back on the drinks if they provided entertainment anything would have been nice I found most of the people wondering around the hotel at night bored! 4. If you are not full board don't eat at the hotel as it will cost you 34 euros for a buffet meal, not including a drink. Overall if you are looking for a quiet holiday and not to do much this is a perfect place to go. It's a shame the hotel is missing any atmosphere as they are going to loose many customers from this. Whilst staying there the people I spoke to all said the same they would not return due to the hotel not having any atmosphere."
Sep 2013,40,My experence,"I have a a very mixed review about this Hotel but overall it was excellent! Yes as most people i would not class this as a 5star Hotel,there are a few areas that need improvement but nothing that you could not cope with.Yes the Tv is old fashioned but who stays in and watchs TV on Holiday?A good point we went on the 8th of August for one week which you think the pool area would be full but this was not the case around the accomodation pools you could still get a sun bed in the afternoon no need to get up at the crack of dawn to get a sun bed.You had plenty of space and not crowded!"
Sep 2013,50,Perfect holiday! Loved this hotel,"We visited this hotel on the 17th September for a week, 4 adults, a toddler and a baby.After reading some of the reviews on here I was a bit unsure of what to expect. However our experience of this hotel was beyond our expectations!Every area of the hotel was immaculate, our rooms were cleaned daily but the lovely maids who were always happy and very pleasant.Breakfast was good with everything you could imagine on offer, poached eggs, omelettes etc could be cooked freshly by the chief on request. The pools were clean and pool bar good offering snacks and daily cocktails, very reasonable for a hotel bar.Our room was a sea view room. Fantastic view of the bay! It was spacious, clean and quiet. We read a few reviews with people complaining about not having a flat screens, but we personally didn't go on holiday to Portugal to stay in the room and watch TV!!We travelled to the old town every night, the shuttle bus provides by the hotel was free and ran till 7.20, and we got a taxi back which was about €7. Overall I would rate this hotel highly and would definitely return!Maybe the room decor isn't to everyone's taste, but you can't please everyone!!!Thanks you for our fantastic holiday :)"
Sep 2013,30,"An average 4*, not a 5*","The hotel looks really impressive from the outside, inside was OK, as were the bedrooms.Had to wait in a long queue, despite having a disabled companion, to check in.  As independent travellers, not impressed. The staff at the hotel were unresponsive, not what I would expect from a 5* establishment - some were downright miserable.Only booked in for B & B, so can only comment on the breakfasts.  They were definitely varied, but for some reason, except for when eating toast, my companion - a well travelled individual - was ill.  Eating outside was a problem as there seemed to be a wasps nest near by and we were continually plagued with wasps.This was definitely not a classy 5* hotel, just an average 4* tourist hotel.We will not be back."
Sep 2013,50,still excellent,"Returned to this hotel for family holiday, 1st time staying there in a 1 bed apt. Have to say they are ideal for family holiday with kids. Well equiped with microwave, toaster, fridge, kettle, hobs etc. Also 2 tv's, one in bedroom. Stayed half board, food excellent, great loaction away from noise of tourist area's but close enough to walk to strip if desired. Hotel also has courtesy bus to strip and albuferia. Staff helpful and pleasant. It is expensive, but location is worth it and would definately go back. Would say that got A2B transfer for 1st time and were left waiting for hour in airport before transfer to resort. Given the standard line that there was a problem with drivers car. Later found out that they give drivers impossibly tight schedule to keep to. Not impressed although transfer to airport was punctual. Beware also that if stay in main building in hotel, book sea view or you could end up in room facing the car park. Not ideal. Also request pool view in apartment booking. Some apartments have a view of .... another apartment. Not so good.  The place is quiet but I love it and will be back."
Sep 2013,20,Definitely NOT 5 star disappointng,"The hotel looks good from outside and reception area, stayed for 8 nights in July 2013. Myself, husband, 11 year old and two year old.  Room was basically a one bedroom self catering apartment, down flight of stair so had to lift buggy up and down every time we left and returned to room.  Couldn't leave patio door open either as not private and a wall with a drop at the end of it.  Not great for small children.Room in serious need of upgrading.Wall paper hanging off walls, tiles missing from edges, chipped bath, roof not properly repaired after a leak.  And to top it off, wondered why the cot had a sheet over one side of it.  That would be to hide the wall crumbling away.  Not impressed, asked to move rooms but nothing available for couple of days so wouldn't have been worth it!  Not what you expect for 5star, stayed in far better 4star hotels.  Breakfast was a joke, if you didn't get there early enough massive queues so we didn't bother most mornings.  To be honest the food on offer wasn't that great no omelettes etcLocation wasn't the best about 15 min walk to montechero strip, not really for family's more for young people on holiday.  Most nights took taxi to and from old town.  Hotel had no atmosphere at all not entertainment.Beach was nice but not buggy friendly, had to carry it up and down heaps of steps.Won't return to this hotel, not sure where all the good reviews come from?"
Sep 2013,40,"Nice location, nice beaches","We stopped for 2 days in this resort in September 2013. Nice building, bungalows, landscaping, inside halls, rest area and restaurants. Absolutely standard level of service in a buffet area, nothing extraordinary at service level  - no ""good morning"", no smiles, just hard work from servers.If you expecting hi-end service and resort you choose something else. Here you will find OK for everything:- not fresh smells in the room (old carpets with marks on it)- TV 20 years old with 14inch screen, no fast internet (we were not able to use our computers to check the office back home and cameras at home, not enough speed and power)- no welcome package- no fresh local newspapers, you will have to buy newspapers in a downstairs lobby store around 5 EUROs for just ordinary ""yellow""  papersjust regular resort... 3-4 stars maxBUT! Gorgeous beach area and it's public, make sure you don't take nothing valuable to swim, just towelI would not go there second time, but if you will take room with ocean view, at least in a morning you will have nice view and you will have great morning mood as we did.Staff is friendly and helpful, overloaded pool area, but we even didn't stop there, went directly to the beach area to enjoy waves and clean sand.We didn't had dinner at this resort because we were recommended to have fresh fish in a local café and restaurants. I will recommend you do the same - eat at local restaurants, great dinners and launches, fresh fish every day with fresh veggy and potato. COFFEE as MUST - delicious:)Don't need to have change for staff, just to cleaning lady, nobody is around to tip.Breakfast is ok to have in your package to not run to the outside to have yogurt or cereal with your kids.Please go to other beaches and walk in that city, very-very nice local atmosphere and people, very friendly, very simply, I miss this attitude in our busy community this days."
Sep 2013,40,good hotel but has faults,"Just back from this hotel on bed and breakfast basis,first impressions of driving into hotel are great and reception area is impressive.rooms are also very good but thought bed was a bit hard and the shower was just ordinary,but only minor faults.Breakfast is a bit chaotic and need to push or be pushed but food was good except for horrible sausages and they ran out of cooked food very quickly,pool area was quite spacious and no problem getting a bed, this was probably helped with the beach being so close,though some people got the impression that the beach belonged to the hotel which it does not and 2 sunbeds and an umbrella are 15euros for all day and10euros for half a day.But the beach was superb.The walk into town is a bit up and down but is only 10-15 mins,then there is a courtesy bus that takes you into the old town which is a great bonus.At night the hotel is very quiet with not many people about which is a pity as it is a lovely hotel if not a wee bit dear for a drink.All in all i would recommend this hotel"
Sep 2013,40,Grande....but not 5 star Grand!,Very pleasant hotel with excellent / attentive staff.  Hotel itself is on first impressions 5 star but the hotel rooms are a little dated and do need a touch of TLC.  That said the rooms are spacious and clean.  We would return to this hotel but as mentioned above we'd want the rooms to get a make over and have basics such as DVD player and kettle esp if deemed 5 star!
Sep 2013,40,Well run hotel.,"Stayed at this Hotel for 7 days and found it to be a very professionally run premises. The staff were very attentive. The room was kept  clean and tidied every day. We enjoyed our stay. The only down side was that the buffet food for breakfast was never hot. Other than that, Very good."
Sep 2013,30,A very nice pleasant holiday,"We have had a lovely week at this resort, but like others have said there are positives and negatives (as their are with every place anyone goes to)For us :-Negatives - We had a room with a ""resort view"" that really meant a view of the car park and front reception area, not exactly what we had in mind ! Wonderful choice at breakfast but the hot food is cooked en mass so not always hot, they have a choice of eggs cooked 4 mins or 8 mins, I had a 4 min egg but sadly they were also cooked in advance so was like a hard boiled one ! Prices for food/drinks expensive. Positives - Very clean, staff friendly, courtesy towels for the pool area daily, lovely clean pools (one heated), rooms cleaned daily, no need to reserve a sunbed, there were plenty ! small fault with our room safe, but came to repair it quickly and efficiently.Thoughts - Good supermarket out the hotel turn right, round the corner and its just on the left, if you are going to use the courtesy shuttle bus start to queue about 20 mins before it leaves but as far as we could see everybody always got on. No kettles in the room, we took a travel one. The pavements on the 10 min walk to the restaurants/bars are quite uneven, I don't recommend high heels.Enjoy - we did !!"
Sep 2013,40,Quiet but pleasant off season break,"Went for a short break and found this hotel very pleasant, sunshine and good weather every day, pleasant location on the beach and no problems with the food. The hotel and its environs were good, but the neighbourhood was not to our liking, so the few days there were enough.There was a free bus running into the town, so we explored an out-of-season empty town that catered mainly for tourists with outdoor bars and sports screened TVs and waiters trying to coax us onto empty tables, all day English breakfasts, etc and reminded us of Blackpool without the crowds.Another area called the Strip, was also looking derelict and empty with empty bars, souvenir shops and the modern ""Kiss me Quick"" hats so with nothing else on offer, it was back to the hotel.The beach bar provided adequate beers, the wines were very poor and the food or snacks not that great, but in the hotel itself, the beers were better, wine acceptable and food of fairly good quality.The decor and staff and hotel was good, but I would not have thought it merited 5 stars, but provided a good  and pleasant break but the overall area would not entice me to return.The pools were empty out of season, but looked nice and this would be a good location for families for a short break."
Sep 2013,30,This hotel is NOT 5 star,"This hotel was a disappointment, we stayed in an ocean view suite which had a separate lounge and two bathrooms. While the rooms were large, carpets were badly stained in both rooms and there were many chips in the paint work, similarly in other areas the hotel needed refurbishing. As we arrived in the afternoon we decided to eat in the buffet on the first night. The food was poor, meat was tough and the hot food was at best only warm and at €34 per head (not including water) very poor value, not surprisingly we did not eat in the buffet again.Breakfast choice good but again anything that was supposed to be hot was virtually cold - trying to get a decent fried egg was difficult as they were cooked at about 12 a time and left on a tray in a heated area, they were either under cooked or dried out and cold.The courtesy bus to the old town is a joke, it only has 27 seats which given the number of people who wanted to use it in the evening was ridiculous, also the last bus is at 7.20 pm. If you could not get a seat you then had to wait up to an hour for a taxi.Overall the hotel is expensive especially for drinks with water at €4 a bottle – 5 star prices but compared to other 5 star hotels we have stayed in around the world definitely not 5 star quality."
Sep 2013,50,FIRST CLASS FIVE STAR HOTEL!,"Can't praise this hotel enough. From start to finish the hotel and staff were outstanding. The breakfasts were second to none ( only don't expect NOT to put on weight!!!) The choice of food was fantastic with the added advantage of buffet-style service, enabling you to return as many times as you want. Families were well catered for throughout the hotel.The rooms were cleaned daily to a very high standard and all communal areas were spotless. There was a choice of five pools in various locations with adequate loungers and parasols. The pool bars had a good range of snacks/sandwiches etc. and reasonably priced.The shuttle bus service which is run by the hotel is excellent. However it might be difficult to get a seat in the height of the season.As we were not to be collected until 3.30am by our transport to the airport, we decided to dine in the hotel on the final evening at the 'buffet' arriving at 8.45pm. However, as the dining room opened at 7.00pm, we found that most of the dishes were finished and although they served food until 10.00pm they were very slow in replacing empty dishes and some foods ie: chicken were never replaced. Desserts were greatly depleted and not replaced to the original standard. At 34 euros per head we felt a little disappointed especially considering the standard of the rest of the hotel and staff.On the whole we would thoroughly recommend this hotel.Thank you for a most enjoyable holiday."
Sep 2013,30,Enjoyed my stay but this IS NOT a 5 star hotel!,"I'll try to keep this brief.Good:-Pool and communal areas were cleanStaff were courteousSun loungers were readily availableSpa was lovelyFood that we ate was nice (I didn't have dinner here)Hotel was on the beachNot so good:-The fine dining restaurant and one of the bars were closed, despite me saying in August?!? So we had the choice of one restaurant (a 35 Euro per head buffet) or go out for dinner. I definitely paid high season prices for my stay, so why were all facilities not available (not a 5 star service)?Shuttle service to Albufiera Old/New Towns only has 27 seats (this is a huge hotel, surely they must realise more than 27 people might want to go to the Old/New Town) and runs once an evening.Once the shuttle has been missed (often due to capacity being reached) it almost impossible to get a taxi. One night we waited an hour a 20 minutes along with a group of 10-15 other guests. The reception staff weren't that fussed about the whole debacle; although they probably couldn't have done much, it would have just been nice/consoling to be given the impression that they cared. They just stood around inside while we all waited outside (is that a 5 star service??). I'd expect a 5 star hotel to have agreed some sort of contract with a local taxi firm (knowing how hard it is to get a taxi come 7/8pm) or to have a shuttle service with greater capacity or frequency.The service at the one bar that was open was painfully slow. To the point where you often found yourself having to neck your drinks, that you had originally ordered with 30 mins to spare, quickly and settle the bill before dashing for the afore mentioned shuttle bus. Thing is, the bar wasn't that busy? Bearing in mind how hard it was to get a taxi if you missed the bus...Had I been staying at a cheaper/lower rated hotel these things wouldn't have been a huge issue. The staff were all friendly, the pool area was nice as was the beach (even if a little crowded). But I paid 5 star in August prices and got 4 star off season service/facilities."
Sep 2013,50,Excellent hotel,"The hotel was excellent, tastefully decorated, great layout, very clean and spacious. The staff were very polite and helpful and the breakfasts were excellent quality. We didn't have any other meals there as they were very expensive but we wanted to eat out anyway so it didn't matter to us. The hotel was an oasis in the middle of what appeared to be like a Blackpool resort. (Albufeira). There was a free courtesy bus into town which was very handy and we could walk down to the lovely beach from the hotel within 30 seconds. A great base for a holiday on the Algarve."
Sep 2013,30,"Great hotel, pity about the prices","We were really impressed on the arrival to the hotel. The grounds and reception area were impressive.We informed the trainee receptionist that it was our first time to Portugal. We were neither provided maps or directions. The hotel provides a free bus, limited spaces. You are required to queue aprox 30 mins prior to departure to get a place. If you order a taxi, you are given a unique identifier number and its up to you to sort it out if their is other guests. It's a little demeaning.The prices of food and drink are ridiculous compared to if you travelled out if the complex. €10 for a burger with a bag of crisps. €4 for a liter of water. Wine and beer are also very expensive when compared to the strip and old town.Our room was a good size, it was serviced every day. We had breakfast included. Great choices, but pretty tasteless."
Sep 2013,50,Fantastic Holiday!,"This is our first experience of a package holiday and as the time approached for our holiday, I checked out this site and started to get a bit nervous as there seemed to be a few negative feedback.  However, we had a fantastic holiday and could not fault it.  We were a family of 4 (kids 11yrs & 14yrs) and we had a one bedroom resort suite.  It was a great apartment and didn't get to spend a lot of time in it as we were by the pool most of the day!  Lots of sun loungers available and the breakfast and evening buffets were out of this world.  So much choice!  The staff were very welcoming and we didn't see one waiter or waitress who didn't smile!  We caught the shuttle bus into the local town and had no problems with getting on.  Plenty of room.  Loved the fact the towels are changed daily and maid service is daily too. We even had a cake & bottle of wine delivered on my husband's birthday!  Overall, it was a fantastic holiday and would certainly go back again."
Sep 2013,40,Lots of good things,"We've just returned from our holiday in one of the garden apartments (one bedroom, sofa beds in lounge, kitchenette) and we enjoyed it. Great to see so many different Europeans holidaying in the same place. The complex is clean, in fact I'd go so far as to say immaculate. The hotel itself has a fabulous view out to see, the garden rooms/suites don't and whilst they do afford you some flexibility re catering ours was right at the back of the resort which meant we experienced a lot of road noise. The decor is a little dated, and perhaps not to everyone's taste but they are very clean. We travelled with our son, who enjoyed some of the kids club stuff, some of the staff were great. The downsides (for us) of the hotel were its location - it's on a busy road and whilst Albufeiria and Olhas d'Agua are within walking distance it's not a pleasant walk. As others have noted breakfast can be a bit of a 'bun fight', which is shame as the breakfast variety and standard is of itself superb! My suggestion to the hotel would be to have more staff on at breakfast: the summer is busy and really guests shouldn't have to wait in a long queue why tables lay uncleared or worse still laid up but empty! The only big problem we had was the beds - twin beds shoved together and blankets not duvets, and the beds and pilllows are probably the most uncomfortable I've slept on. The hotel did try to 'soften' the bed by placing more blankets underneath the undersheet but it wasn't ideal... That aside. The hotel is lovely everywhere is immaculate and, for us, that counts for a lot, just a few extra tweaks and this place would be excellent"
Aug 2013,50,Loved it!,"Just wanted to re-iterate the last few good reviews of this hotel. We returned home yesterday after a week and are already planning our trip back next year, a first for us. One of the things we loved about this hotel was the fact that there were so many local Portuguese guests, as well as Spanish, French, German, American. I would say probably only around a quarter of guests were British, which we felt made for a really lovely atmosphere and makes such a nice change from ""Brits abroad"" hotels and resorts.We went half board and felt the food at the evening buffet was first class, loads of choice, lots of local Portuguese dishes, loads of lovely salads and no chips - hurrah! The cooked breakfast was on a couple of occasions a little cold, but other than that good. It does get very busy later on at beakfast but we are talking 10 am which you have young kids like us you'll be woken up way before that!  The staff in the restaurant are lovely, special mention to Philip our waiter most evenings, who was so friendly especially with the children, but also ultra-professional. Sometimes the staff in the buffet are a little too quick to clear plates, turn your back and it's been whipped away, but that is purely over-efficiency rather than them trying to hurry you up.  As a number of others have mentioned no problems at all with sun beds. It's so nice not having o get up early to reserve sun beds, again a reflection not only of the number of beds around lots of different pools but also the fact that the Portuguese and Spanish don't indulge in such ridiculous behaviour!Kids club was good for our kids as it wasn't too structured, most of the activities seemed to be focused at the Portuguese kids and I am not sure how good the staff were at communicating with the British children, but this wasn't an issue for our kids. Being only 3 and 5 the fact that they had big open rooms they could run around in out of the hot sun and toys to play with was a real bonus and they were more than happy to go in and do their own thing, meeting up with some of the other kids they'd met round the pool. Half hour mini-disco in the kids club at 8 pm is great as it gives you a break and a bit of peace to eat your meal sans enfants.We stayed in a resort suite and yes the rooms could probably do with an update before too long but they are spotless and have everything you need. Previous reviewers who have got so worked up about old TVs in rooms will be relieved to know we had a flat screen in ours. Beds not the best, but perfectly acceptable for a decent nights sleep. Could probably do with a some new bedding but really this is our only gripe and for us was massively outweighed by all the positives.In summary the resort isn't a perfect 5 star resort and the price reflects that, but it has a lovely atmosphere, really convenient features, easy flight and short trip from airport, great food and lovely staff. If you want a lovely relaxing family holiday which is great value we would highly recommend. We will definitely return next year."
Aug 2013,30,OK but only ok,"No major complaints, but given that this is a 5 star complex it didn't drive us wild with excitement. The reception was impressive and the gardens and pool areas were pleasant. The rooms certainly didn't justify their 5 star billing but they were cleaned daily and spacious. I thought it was poor that the rooms didn't have a DVD player, and the televisions were a bit archaic, one might expect flat screen, but alas, not. The guys that ran the kids club were very friendly although there was very little uptake for the 12 and overs which was disappointing but not their fault. Don't be misled that it has its own beach, it doesn't. The beach however is lovely but rammed from 9-7 during August when we were there. 15 euros for 2 sunbeds and an umbrella for half a day is quite ridiculous, especially when you see how closely they are packed (sardines), so we didn't bother. Our biggest disappointment was the area, especially as we were self catering. There are loads of restaurants within about 15-20 minute walk, but they are crammed along a busy road, hardly our idea of a relaxing evening. Albufeira is an old town totally spoiled, with its line of beach front  restaurants all serving the same food, with spiv's outside trying to drag people in. We did find a great place to eat (called Castello do Mar Bar) above the marina which is about a 15 minute walk from old town, This was a lovely dining experience, in stark contrast to the commercialised and (now) unattractive old town centre.  The food in the hotel was very good, although we only ate there twice as it was very pricey (particularly the drinks). Despite all of this, we had a lovely holiday, I don't want to leave the impression that there was anything particularly bad about the place, but perhaps we expected more. We wouldn't return to Grand Real, simple as that"
Aug 2013,50,Totally brilliant holiday,"I don't usually leave reviews, tend to read them more. But felt I had to leave one this time, as before we left home, some negarive feedback did make us uncertain if we had made a good choice. We leave tomorrow and none of us want to leave.We are a family of 4, (kids age 14,7). We had a one bedroom apartment (557) which was big enough for us, with kitchen facilites, (kettle and microwave). Wifi in the apartment, this was a bonus. Aircon, terrace overlooking the pool, which was great as you can see the kids by the pool. There were always sun beds by this pool and not too busy, most guests tend to use the 2 pools at the hotel, which is a 3min walk. I did request toppers for the mattress before I left home, it was all done and the bed is fine, (had read reviews about the beds being hard).The hotel is really lovely, the lobby is big, cool, open and with a totally relaxed feel, sofas and chairs everywhere to chill out at anytime of the day, great to escape for some Wifi time after breakfast. It did feel like a 5star. Rooms were cleaned daily, fresh towels.The beach is close by, some steps down via a secure gate, but it is a public beach. We thought this is quite nice, even though it gets busy, it is nice to see a mixture of different nationalities and local people.We went on a Bed and breakfast, breakfast was great, lots to choose from.At night it is expensive to eat here, as it is a 5star hotel, but the service has been brilliant. Very friendly waiters and waitresses.We took the free bus into Albufeira old town a couple of times, for a nice change, and taxi back (8euros).Good place to eat just outside the hotel is Martins, you must try it. We went for dinner twice.We would recommend this place. We would be happy to come back."
Aug 2013,50,really enjoyed,we werent looking forward to our stay as the reviews recently hadnt been good but we were pleasantly surprised and couldnt fault it.  Slept really well and didnt find the beds hard. We are a family of 5 and we always found sunbeds by the pool we never had a problem. The apartment was spotless and close to the pool which was nice.  We caught the free bus to the old town and went to that beach a few times as found the beach at the hotel very busy and also looked around albufeira also the sunbeds are cheaper to hire at the beach in albufeira.  We enjoyed having a drink in the bar at night and looking out to sea.  Yes we probably would go back one day. We have also learnt not to believe all the negative comments you read!
Aug 2013,50,Fabulous Resort,"This hotel was so good we went back two years in a row. It has all the amenities you could ever need on a holiday, the high standard of the hotel really wowed us. The rooms were great, very high quality, very clean  with great bathrooms. The first time we stayed we got a sea view room which also looked over the pools which was great. The second time we went we got a side view room which was also fine just as good a quality and the side view was nice also.We were on a couples holiday and this hotel suited great for that but at the same time it would also suit families as there is a kids club and the hotel is safety enclosed. As a couple it was great as there was nice bars and food and it was relaxing around the pool. The location of the hotel is excellent, it is right on a the St Eulaila beach which you have private access to from the hotel where you just have to walk down a short path and you are there. There are also a couple of nice restaurants on the way down. The hotel is just a short taxi drive to the old town Alburfeira, where we went most nights. It is a great town with lots of lovely bars and restaurants and lots going on. The breakfast in this hotel is out of this world, it has everything you could ever imagine or would ever think you would want. They cater for every taste and every nationality, there was nothing left out, it was way beyond our expectations.I am sure we will be back in the future."
Aug 2013,50,Best time ever,"Had a fantastic time staying at this resort with my boyfriend! The hotel was clean and friendly and the staff were so accommodating. The breakfast buffet was lovely with a huge variety of different types of food and plenty of champagne. The restaurant choices were brilliant with yummy fresh food.we were given vouchers for each night of our stay which we used for the payment of our dinner. ..we were glad that it was a calm atmosphere,not somewhere to go for the 'ibiza' lifestyle. The spa was amazing with some great deals daily on all types of treatments. We were delighted with this lovely place and plan to return very soon."
Aug 2013,50,What a reation price / quality.,"I have stayed at the Grande Real Santa Eulalia Resort & Hotel one week at the end of July. The building is not very nice from the exterior but what a difference inside: luxury and mostly comfortable.  The location over the Santa Eulalia beach very difficult could be better, with a very easy access to the beach and beautiful views. Something that at the splendid breakfast, if served outside near the pool, is an unforgettable experience. It’s the view that almost save the dinner’s experience at the “Santa Eulalia” restaurant due the food been very average. Almost the same ( expensive ) price and you could eat much better at the “Pescador “ restaurant at the beach. By opposite the no pretentious “Real” restaurant ( seasonal ) it’s quite nice. The hotel is general well preserved. The only issue was the reception. I really do not thing that the team have any idea what is a receptionist ‘s job apart of making check-in and check-out. At check-in there was not “good afternoon”, or “welcome”, just check the reserve, fill the hotel form and give the room keys.  Not even the attention of providing the minimum hotel’s information to the new guests.  I have to ring 5 times to reception to be sure that my room will be clean during the morning before lunch, unfortunately with no luck almost all time. Most of the staff is very nice and courteous and the breakfast team is really wonderful. Concluding apart some minor issues – very easy resolved if the management wanted -  it was a very pleasant experience with a great relation price / quality.  Very recommended."
Aug 2013,40,"Fabulous place, needs a bit of TLC and better food","I stayed at this Hotel 10 days with my wife and 2 daughters. Overall it was a very nice stay, only faulted by some need for better care and a few updates. The rooms have a somehow dated decor. Here and there there were some unresolved stains on the carpet and upholstery, scruffs on doors and furniture, broken tiles, but nothing that extreme. We tried the jacuzzi bathtub once but didn't work and expelled some nasty gunk and sand. Must be from low usage. The TVs in the room are still old CRTs with about 20-30 channels but the TV menu didn't work and sometimes all the channels would appear as locked. I was expecting better in room entertainment from a 5 star unit. The room comes with an empty minibar which is handy to store baby and toddler food. The rooms and bathrooms are very spacious. One annoying thing is the motion sensor light in the room hall (we had a suite) that kept lighting up when we were trying to put the children to sleep. If you have kids, they will love the kids club. Apart from the toys and art materials they do several activities everyday, like movie showings, magic shows and even show and tell with reptiles the kids can pet like 3m snakes! My daughters had to be dragged off of there almost every day :)The pools are great, albeit a bit small. One of them and the kids pool are heated to a soup-like 30-33°C which is lovely. There are plenty of sunloungers going around. Now the food. Breakfast is great with plenty of choices. The barbecue at lunch is good although expensive at 29 per person (water and soda included). The night buffet is outrageously expensive for what it is at 34 per person (no drinks, not even water included). Its like conference food, not food from a 5 star resort. Because of this is mostly empty. The restaurant by the beach is the same. Expensive with only average food and with some very rude employees. For lunch we usually went to the bar by the beach. It's not cheap at 30 for 2 adults and 2 kids but the food was very nice (for sandwiches and salad type of food). The hotel has underground parking which was also nice. They offer a complimentary gym as well. Overall a nice stay but some things need to be upgraded and either the food improved or made cheaper."
Aug 2013,40,Not a five star hotel,"Stayed at the hotel on a Bed & Breakfast basis for 7 nights 15/7-22/7/13 with my husband, son (16 yrs and daughter 11 yrs).  Hotel rooms are a little dated, but functional and serve their purpose, however it would of been great to have coffee/tea making facilities in the room.  On the first night we had dinner in the main resturant offering buffet style dinner at Euros 35.00 per person which definately was not worth the money.  The Santa Eulália along the beach front which is part of the hotel is lovely and the food was divine, also cheaper than main resturant.  We also took a taxi twice into Albufeira Old Town (7 Euros) and found a wonderful resturant tucked away in the back streets called ""Bailote"" - really worth going to.  The other restaurant very close to the hotel is ""Martins"" - dont be put off by the exterior of this restaurant as the food is extremely good and very reasonably priced (3 courses each, soft drinks and a bottle of wine came to 120 Euros).We had enough of the sun after five days and discovered ""Parque Aventura"" literally 10 minute walk from the hotel and spent a very enjoyable 3 hours zip wiring through the trees.  There are four different levels of difficulty to try and the staff (all English speaking) were helpful.  At ""Balaia Golf Village"" just 10 minute walk from the hotel they have four tennis courts and social tennis takes place every Thursday and Sunday from 5-7pm for 7 Euros per person which is coach organised and very good fun.  There is also a splendid resturant in the golf village and which have Italian buffet every Sunday night which was fantastic.The hotel has four swimming pools located around different parts of the complex, all with a snack bar.  The tennis courts (which was a reason why I choose this hotel) were disappointing.  The hotel website states two tennis courts, but in reality there is only one which has a broken net and the other is used for football I believe, and doesnt have a net.  They charge you 8 Euros to hire the court and loan racquets per hour, but we just turned up very early with our own racquets as it is not worth paying to play with a broken net, especially when you have your own equipment!"
Aug 2013,30,Good. Although not 5 star,"Stayed for 10days with husband and son. We were in a 1 bed roomed apartment which was ok for our needs but definitely not 5 star standard. This was our 7th visit and we have stayed in the hotel and apartments. We stayed in 429 which was perfectly situated for the pool but had a distinct smell of drains. The bath wouldn't drain after the 1st shower, so by the time my son showered he was practically knee high in water!!  There was also a nasty smell in the kitchen area, probably from the sink. The bar service in the evening is painfully slow making a nightcap not worth the cost or the bother. We never had trouble getting a sun bed but there really isn't any service around the pool. You would expect this in a 5star hotel. Also the choice of food around the pool is very limited (baguettes and salads). The tables next to the beds were never cleaned the whole time we were there. We enjoyed our dinner in the restaurant by the beach but the staff are truley miserable likewise for the staff in the atlantica restaurant. It's outrageous that you have to pay for sunbeds and an umberella at the beach. The reception staff were polite and helpful. A very large gripe is the free shuttle service in albufeira. It's a free service and as usual we English are prepared to queue and wait our turn to get on. This does not happen with other nationalities. The hotel needs to have a system where they give out tickets at reception and when the 27 seats are gone, that's it. It was very stressful trying to get on the bus when there is more than 1 of you. We enjoyed our time at grande real but we will probably try somewhere different next year as the hotel really is not 5 star. Just 5 star prices"
