Jun 2013,50,New boutique hotel is a winner,"We stayed in this hotel when it was just 20 days old, expecting all sorts of teething problems but there were none.  It is in a fantastic location in the centre of Lisbon, where everything is within walking distance.  We did not realise that you could not drive up to the hotel, you can only do this if you arrive early in the morning.  After that, the restaurant tables and chairs all come out and the street is pedestrianised for the rest of the day.  We phoned the hotel and Pedro, the very friendly concierge, ran out to meet us and accompanied us to the parking garage close by.  Mariana, the receptionist, gave us a warm welcome and we were shown to a room with twin beds.  We requested a double and it was changed within minutes.  The mattress and pillows were very comfortable.  Gowns and slippers are provided in all rooms, as well as Nespresso coffee and a complimentary mini-bar.  Wi-Fi is also free and easy to connect to.  The room was very spacious with a desk for working, with European, English and US plugs.   On our pillows were 2 little chocolates and a welcome note, a lovely touch.  I have stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels in the past year or two and have been surprised and disappointed to see that the 5 star hotels no longer carry on this tradition and it is the 4-star hotels, like Santa Justa, who seem to be going the extra mile for guests.  We were very impressed to see that when we returned from dinner, there was a small bottle of port with 2 glasses and pasteis da natas waiting for us.  Breakfast was excellent and caters well for anyone wanting a health, continental or a full English breakfast.  The owners of this hotel and their staff have gone out of their way to create a good impression and attract guests and they have got it right.  We had another favourite 4-star boutique hotel in Lisbon but will definitely return to this one."
Jun 2013,40,"Great place, good service, central location","This hotel has a great location on one of the pedestrian streets right by the Rossi metro, the aerobus stop and the tram out to Belem.  The staff were friendly and the welcome pasteis de nata and port were delicious!The rooms were nice and as others have said, brand new and shiny.  Our only complaint was that all the double beds in the standard rooms are two beds stuck together rather than a single mattress.  We had asked about this specifically before arrival so were dismayed to find this the case (plus the beds in our room were different heights!).  After asking about it 4 times, finally we were allowed to talk to the manager and after much investigation of different rooms she offered us a suite with a single queen size mattress.In the end a very comfortable stay.  The breakfast is great (including nespresso coffee and more pasteis).  We would definitely recommend this hotel to others."
Jun 2013,50,"Class, service and quality","This hotel is centrally located and easy access to restaurants, shops, attractions, metro , buses etc.Excellent breakfast, fresh and tasty.Staff were exceptional and always helpful. They showed first class service and went out of their way to assist.Absolutely made our stay worth it.Front office staff, Sandrina and Pedro were exceptional and made you feel welcome. A first great impression.Jose in the kitchen assisted us with all meal requirements for breakfast and was very attentive."
Jun 2013,40,Great place to stay!,"The hotel is brand new and just opened their doors. Located in the pedestrian area near Rossi metro station, so easily reachable with the metro from the airport. Nicely decorated, clean and perfect location; the Elevator to Bairro Alto is just around the corner."

Nov 2020,50,Mr Kay,"Our stay was great, nice location, immaculately clean room, great breakfast, staff service was professional, very kind.The restaurant has a range of food to choose from, steak was brilliant. Thank you so much. J Kayumba"
Nov 2020,40,Free mini bar,"It is a very good hotel located in the city center, the rooms are beautiful and pleasant, beautiful view, good bedding, practical bathroom, the cleaning is impeccable and the sanitary barriers well respected, the breakfast is excellent and the staff is excellent. adorable, the only problem is that each time we returned to the hotel we were verbally attacked by the restaurateurs located opposite the hotel, it was really unpleasant"
Sep 2020,30,Weak hygienic concept in Restaurant,"The hotels location is perfect for a city trip. The room is very modern and well equipped. The checkin was friendly and efficient. We got a complimentory small bottle of port wine and two warm pieces of pasteis de nata. We really loved them, thank you very much.Unfortunately our room smelled weired from the sink. The rain shower was unusable until I cleaned it myself from limescale. Not that a big deal but it does not fit to the class of hotel.But it got very bad when we went to breakfast. The waiter was not very informative so we found out that we had to pick a free table on our own. We could not be safe if the table was already cleaned and desinfected. As we noticed they do not clean tables anyway after each guest. Next we had to figure out that we had to pick our juices and coffee on our own from a public table. So this means narrow queueing with other guests that do not all wear masks over open juice cans. Next every guest touches the buttons of the coffee machine. BTW noone ever checked if we desinfected hands before entering the restaurant. Glasses, cups and coffee spoons are free to touch and cough on from any guest. All together this a no go in these times."
Sep 2020,50,An unforgettable experience!,"We have chosen this hotel in advance because it was the best starting point for all our activities due to its location in the old town!To the surprise of my girlfriend, who I wanted to propose to, I contacted the hotel. Every single member of staff was self-sacrificing, incredibly friendly and emphatic at all times. With great effort they gave me many great suggestions and also established contact with local tour guides for the realization of my wishes! At the end of an unforgettable day for me, they also decorated my room with rose petals, put champagne in the fridge and even gave us another bottle of champagne the next day. We were really surprised how friendly and laborious the service was there! Right at the beginning they gave us a map and explained all the possibilities, what we could visit and where it was nice.The tips were fantastic ! The food was mega delicious and the rooms were top ! Every day we got new bed linen and a completely clean room ! Despite the location in the middle of the city we didn't hear a single word through well insulated windows !We seldom felt so well cared for and would come back anytime!Thank you very much for an unforgettable vacation with a perfectly tuned proposal for my girlfriend, which the hotel made possible for me !"
Sep 2020,50,Wonderful stay,"Everything was just perfect and wonderful, especially the bathroom, the welcoming gift, the location, the breakfast, the free drinks in the fridge and of course the service. This is definitely a place I will visit again."
Sep 2020,30,Nice Hotel but,"This is a nice hotel in a good location but, the holiday is a birthday present from my husband to me so he decided to push the boat out and rent a suite, we dont always go out late so this was an ideal option, there was a bit of confusion when we arrived and the room we were allocated did not have a balcony, the reception staff were great and changed the room to one with a balcony, sadly it may have a balcony but the room although a big size was not laid out as a suite, the TV is on the wall facing the bed and cannot be moved and the sofa is across the room so you cannot see the TV unless you are on the bed, there are a couple of dining chairs which I must say are really uncomfortable so they were not an option, I do not have a TV in the bedroom at home and I do not like to lay on a bed to watch it. We did have a bit of an issue with the room being cleaned but hopefully that is now sorted out, all I can say if you want a suite do not book this room. The staff have been mainly helpful and we were sent some fruit and water as a gift, this is not so much a review of the hotel more the fact we paid quite a bit for what we thought was a room we could relax in as well as sleep and this has not been the case."
Sep 2020,40,Recommended ,"The hotel is clean, peaceful and modern, the personal is kind and fast. A great choice if you’re looking for a staying in a strategic position (historical city centre). However prices are not the cheapest."
Aug 2020,50,Outstanding! Highly recommended,"Excellent service from all the staff from start to finish in  a great hotel in an ideal location. Booked some bubbles to celebrate our 30th Anniversary on arrival to find we had also been upgraded. Room was excellent and hotel is ideally located for key attractions too. Breakfast and hygiene measures also excellent. Small touches like welcome note, our anniversary being mention by staff during our stay and a fee mini bar all helped too. Highly recommend this hotel."
Aug 2020,40,Good Location & Spacious Room,"We had a great spacious suite which was perfect to let us spread out a bit. Our room was also in the first floor facing the street which could have been terrible but the windows are 100% soundproof! I am very sensitive to noise so this is no overstatement. It’s great that the minibar is all free as well, that’s a rare perk. Nice and diverse breakfast buffet. The couple cons would be the WiFi, which was spotty at times, and the darkness of the rooms.  It is also in a very crowded area - great for touring easily though."
Apr 2020,50,Beyond my expectations,"The location of the hotel is excellent, right in the city centre, close to restaurants and public transport.  My room was clean and well furnished.  Staff were helpful.  Nice breakfast. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this hotel."
Apr 2020,50,Perfect Location; Great Staff; Wonderful Experience,"There are so many wonderful things about the Santa Justa.  First, the location.  It sits in the Baixa district -- the gridlike area of streets that's the heart of downtown Lisbon -- at the intersection of the Rua de Santa Justa and the Rua dos Correeiros, both of which are pedestrianized.  From here, you can walk west to the Bairo Alto and Chiado districts with their shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues in 5-12 minutes; to the Rossio train station (where the trains to Sintra depart) in maybe 8 minutes; to the Tejo River in 10-15 minutes; and to Castelo Sao Jorge, Lisbon's cathedral, and the Alfama in 15-20 minutes.  The famous # 28 tram that takes you all the way to Belem can be picked up on the nearby Praca Figueira (where there's also an underground car park) in barely 3-4 minutes.  In short, you can reach practically everything of major interest in downtown Lisbon except for Belem and the Gulbenkian Museum in no more than 20 minutes, on foot.  The area is full of great restaurants (try Bastardo on Rossio Square); there's a legendary pastry shop that dates to around 1820 on the corner; and the Elevador Santa Justa with its platform and panoramic view is a 2-minute walk, making it easy to do first thing in the morning before the lines form.  Second, the staff was superb:  professional; committed; knowledgeable; and friendly!   They helped me get through a very stressful 18 hours after my wallet was pickpocketed in the Alfama.  Special commendations to Joao and Ricardo for their concern and helpfulness throughout.  And everyone speaks excellent English.  My room was on the top floor in the building across the street from the hotel's reception and restaurant.  It was below the roof, which meant it was like a garret with a slanting ceiling and projecting beams.  But it had two small balconies with chairs on the Rua Augusta and the Rua Santa Justa, with wonderful views of the Castelo Sao Jorge, the Baixa skyline, and the Elevador Santa Justa when it was illuminated at night.  Finally, the breakfast was extensive and quite varied, giving me enough food to fuel my touring for a full day without feeling the need to stop for lunch. I hope that someday, I'll have the chance to stay there again!"
Mar 2020,50,Santa Justa staff saved our holiday,"Our son recommended this hotel and we are very glad he did. Its position is excellent, it is a bright, modern and relaxed hotel. Our room was clean and spacious with a huge and very comfortable bed, plenty of storage space, lovely well-equipped bathroom with towels that were actually big enough. Excellent restaurant. The real gem of the Santa Justa is its staff: we arrived just at the start of the corona virus crisis and it is largely due to the hotel staff that we were still able to enjoy our holiday. From reception to housekeeping and particularly the hard-working restaurant staff were unfailingly efficient, friendly and helpful in what must have been extremely difficult times for them."
Mar 2020,50,Professional & friendly service,"The Hotel is located in a very good spot, close to everything that a tourist may be interested. The service is professional and friendly; the breakfast package is a very good deal; It was a very good selection!"
Mar 2020,50,Hotel Santa Justa,"This hotel has an Excellent location for anyone visiting Lisbon.   The rooms were clean and the bed comfortable. The staff was very friendly and  helpful. Unfortunately you will be harassed as you enter and exit the hotel by the restaurant across the street trying to entice you to eat at their establishment . I would still definitely recommend it though ,especially for a short stay in Lisbon as you are close to the waterfront and traffic controlled streets."
Mar 2020,50,Great hotel and staff.,"Lovely hotel in great location. Clean. Helpful staff. Breakfast was well worth it. The Fado performance in the restaurant should not be missed!! The only thing that was not stellar was the dinner we had in the restaurant during Fado night. With so many great eating options in Lisbon, this did not live up. But overall, would highly recommend this hotel."
Mar 2020,50,Exceptional in every way!,"Beautiful and spacious room and bathroom in the heart of Lisbon, a few mts away from the best eateries, public transport and sightseeing. I could not understand why the hotel is not a 5 star, maybe because of the pool Im guessing but amenities, service and room standard wise,it qualifies to be a 5 star. Location perfect, soundproofing perfect, service exceptional. Spl tks to Joao from the front office for all the assistance and travel tips and thank you everyone for the overall brilliant experience. Highly recommend. Will most definitely return."
Mar 2020,50,Hotel Santa Justa,"excellent location, very clean and comfortable, delicious complimentary varied breakfast,excellent location.the staff was friendly and helpful with information, tours and taxi.  live music 3 nights a week was a treat"
Mar 2020,50,Great Stay!,The staff is very professional and helpful. This is a boutique hotel in a fantastic location. The breakfast buffet is really good. Do not leave without having dinner at the restaurant in the hotel. We had a great experience and would stay in this hotel again in the future.
Mar 2020,50,"Perfect Location, Perfect Hotel","I stayed only one night, but will stay at Santa Justa again. Prime location, just a short walk to the sea, around the corner from the famous Santa Justa Lift, and surrounded by pedestrian shopping streets. The breakfast was plentiful and very good. The room was comfortable with a complimentary mini bar. All hotel staff I encountered were professional, pleasant, and helpful."
Mar 2020,50,Very Relaxed ,"We visited the Santa Justa hotel for a second time, as we enjoyed it last year. We stayed in the main hotel building.     The hotel is situated in a fairly central part of Lisbon and is in an excellent position so that you can easily travel by train, bus or walk to most of the main attractions.     The reception staff are friendly and most welcoming, as too are the restaurant staff. The rooms and all public areas are immaculately clean.     There is a good selection of drinks in the refrigerator in the room and you are welcomed with chocolates and wine. A very nice gesture.     The choice of breakfast is excellent, there is such a choice, and it is good quality.     Lifts are available to all floors."
Mar 2020,40,Nice Hotel in Central Lisboa,"Nice quite room, good brekfast, nice personel.You have walk distance to all central parts of Lisboa and trams, taxi and buses 100 meters from the hotelThe famous elevator Santa Justa just 50 meters from the hotel"
Mar 2020,40,Decent hotel with disinterested staff,"The hotel is in a nice location though may be too touristy for some.  Staff lack warmth, sincerity or hospitable focus.  The rooms are excellent & very clean.  Breakfast is nice with good selection to satisfy most travellers."
Feb 2020,50,Two Nights Lisbon,"Fabulous Hotel rather hard to find especially with a rental car as there is no main road access to get there. However once my Husband finally found it one of the Hotel staff came to help us with all our bags. ""Joad"" (hope I have spelling his name correct?) was extremely helpful and went well beyond his duty to make us very comfortable. Nothing was a problem and he really looked after us so well. Rooms were fabulous location of the Hotel was brilliant. Everything was right outside the door and handy to everything. Breakfast buffet was absolutely wonderful. We also ate dinner in the Restaurant as well as they had live music playing. Chef made me a special dish as I'm vegetarian. Nothing was a problem here at this Hotel. I would absolutely stay here again and totally recommend it."
Feb 2020,50,Great Hotel,"Stayed in Triple room with my wife and 16 yr old son for 3 nights.Room was spacious, quiet, well decorated and spotlessly clean. We even had a small balcony with view over the lovely Baixa streets.Breakfast was great with everything you could want..  In addition to juices, cereals, breads, cheeses, ham, cakes there was hot food like Bacon, Eggs, Sausage Pancakes. Just perfect"
Feb 2020,40,Great Central Location,"The hotel is clean and the staff is welcoming and helpful.  From here you are able to walk to all neighborhoods and to enjoy the shops, restaurants, and street performers just outside your door.  The breakfast was nice and its a good deal if you get it included with your room."
Feb 2020,50,Mid term break,"Just returned from a four night stay at the Santa Justa hotel Lisbon . Hotel served all our purposes, very central, friendly and helpful staff, great breakfast, free mini bar,room lovely, only fault would be coffee machine at breakfast,too slow and queue too long, maybe this could be looked at by management. Would definitely stay again on our next visit to Lisbon"
Feb 2020,50,Fantastic,"This hotel is in a fantastic location close to everything. We were on the 6th floor in an attic room. Its compact but clean, theres toilettries,  hairdryer and iron. Perfect for a couple of days. Had breakfast there one day it was good great selection. Hotel staff fantastic if we ever return we would definately stay here again."
Feb 2020,50,The best hotel in Lisbon! ,If you are looking for the best place to stay in Lisbon you found it! In the hart or the old town with delicious restaurant you can find hotel Santa Justa and then you realized that you want to back here every time you will visit Lisbon again.
Feb 2020,30,Average. Lacking atmosphere. ,We visited Lisbon for 3 nights as a family and stayed in Hotel Santa Justa. We were disappointed to be put in the rooms across the street from the hotel. These are in a completely separate building from where the reception and breakfast rooms are. Rooms were a good size. Sound proofing was ok - street noise was still audible. Breakfast was very average. Coffee machine broke down each morning! Staff slightly distant and didn’t engage. No staff member made a friendly effort to get to know us or our children for the duration of the stay. There is no comfortable warm lobby area / reading room to sit around and relax in with a drink in the evening. Overall we felt like we stayed in an apart-hotel rather than the true hotel experience we had hoped for.
Feb 2020,50,Ab Fab hotel in Lisbon old town!,Back in Lisbon in February for the second time and second time at Santa Justa.....great hotel in old town....fantastic staff....very helpful.....spacious rooms and excellent breakfast.....what more could you want!
Feb 2020,50,BEST staff ever!,"I've stayed in many hotels, in many countries, and I honestly think the staff at the Hotel Santa Justa is the BEST.  They're helpful, friendly, thoughtful, and always, always, nice.  It's a delightful hotel, with a wonderful restaurant, and I can't wait to return.  And I definitely will."
Feb 2020,50,Superb hotel,"What a superb hotel super position close to underground car park (not cheap with discount from hotel) the staff excellent food is top quality and room was perfect, breakfast plenty of choices  Will be back. Soon"
Feb 2020,50,Fantastic Hotel,"Our stay at the Hotel Santa Justa has been a great experience for us, the breakfast is very complete, its Prosseco and fresh orange juice were amazing, the rooms are so spacious and modern, but the most important thing for us was its  friendly and helpful staff, every single thing they did for us was wonderful. We will stay again for sure at the Hotel Santa Justa when we go back to Lisbon."
Feb 2020,50,My second stay at Hotel Santa Justa - 100% recommended!!!,"This is my second stay at the Hotel Santa Justa. I previously stayed there for another group trip and I booked a suite back then. This time, I was sharing a room with a friend. We were staying on the 6th floor. The view was quite good and we could see Bairro Alto from our window. The check-in and check-out processes were very quick. The staff speaks excellent English and are very welcoming. We were offered two egg tarts and a bottle of Porto wine upon arrival, which were both delicious. The mini bar was free and included peach juice, beers, still and sparkling water. The beds were very comfy and the shower very great. The hotel also offers a comprehensive amenities kit (toothbrush, razor, sponge, soap). The breakfast is served between 7:30am and 10am. The selection is fairly decent but my highlight would be tbe pasteis de nata. The staff has been extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the city of Lisbon. Hotel Santa Justa is just two minutes away from Rossio and Restauradores station, and next to the Figueira place, where you can easily catch a taxi. While the location of the hotel is perfect as it is right in the city centre, this establishment always offers a high quality experience. I’d definitely recommend this hotel again!"
Feb 2020,50,"Great Hotel for a ""Pause""","Just a few steps from everything - Lisbon's riverfront, the Rua do Comercio, and the Elevator de Santa Justa, which connects the lower and the upper parts of Lisbon. Have a glass of wine in the outdoor cafe/restaurant and then take a stroll and see the sights.   Along the way, take a look at all the menu's from the wide variety of restaurants in this area.  The food and wines of Lisbon are divine!  The hotel staff are gracious, helpful and knowledgeable.  I was having difficulty with the wi-fi and they solved the issue (mainly operator error!!!) in minutes.My room was spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable.  I would recommend this hotel and certainly will go back!"
Feb 2020,50,Fab hotel,"Fab hotel in a wonderful location, close to everything.  Excellent, friendly staff, nothing was too much trouble for them.  Excellent value for money.  Room was wonderful with a fabulous bathroom.  Wine and chocolates a lovely touch."
Feb 2020,50,Just perfect,"Perfect location, next to all the best attractions and the shopping centerThe room was big, clean and well equippedvery good breakfastThe staff were very kind and polite.I sure return to Hotel Santa Justa"
Feb 2020,50,New Year 2020 ,"Excellent Hotel to stay Close to main places to visit on Lisbon.Walking distance commerce square and Santa Justa Elevator.Very friendly and attentive hostesses.Easy to access by metro, close to train station.Love to come back"
Feb 2020,50,Ms,Fab hotel. Excellent staff. Rooms spotless and even had 3 pin sockets so no adapter required! Staff dropped up extra chocolates and port on the second day. Amazing location. I would definitely recommend this hotel!
Feb 2020,30,The reviews are overrated,"We were coming up on the last week of our three-week vacation in Europe.   We spent the first part in Spain and Amsterdam.  We followed someone trip guide I found on the internet since we were visiting some of the same places.   We stay at Hotel Santa Justas, because she highly recommended it for staying in Lisbon.  The room are very small and borderline dirty.  The breakfast area is not clean.  The breakfast buffet was horrible.  The staff was just ok, but the uniforms are not clean.  Our shower was the highlight of the room, it was a rain shower, but be careful the rain shower is too wide, you can’t escape getting soaked. The beds were just ok.    The city of Lisbon was great but compared to Spain it is not as clean.  The hotel is in a great location but be careful of the restaurant owner’s outside, they would run you down daily trying to get you to eat at their restaurant.  At times I felt harassed.   Hotel Santa Justas is just ok, its over price and overrated.  I will give them credit for getting us into our room super early because we arrived early in the morning, it was still dark outside.  Its hard to do so much research onsite only to get it wrong.   We will find another place to stay on our next visit to Lisbon."
Feb 2020,50,Excellent - best hotel we’ve ever stayed in!,"Fantastic hotel, perfect location right in the centre but very peaceful. Beautiful room, spotlessly clean, scrumptious breakfast, extra touches such as port & pastries in room on arrival. Top class!!!"
Jan 2020,50,Go the extra mile,"friendly staff, free mini bar and a lovely room, it was my birthday and there was a knock on the door and they had sent up a small bottle of cava,chocolates and 2 pieces of cake with a card wishing me a happy birthday, it was such a lovely gesture, woulod definitely book to go back to this lovely hotel."
Jan 2020,50,Wonderful experience.,"Great location and a very comfortable, clean room.   Staff were very helpful and courteous.  Decided to try the hotel restaurant for dinner and had a great meal.  Excellent buffet breakfast with so many choices.  Would highly recommend!"
Jan 2020,50,Super hotel,"This little charm hotel is in a great location. It is right in the center where everything is. I stayed two nights and was celebrating my birthday. They upgrade me to a gorgeous room in a corner with a 360 degree balcony. I had champagne delivery to my room with a box of chocolate and a note from the hotel wishing me a happy birthday. The staff was nice and professional, breakfast in the morning is excellent. Also complimentary frig with free drinks!! Great price for all you get.  I will choose to  stay in Hotel Santa Justa when I visit Lisbon again!!!..... love this hotel!!!"
Jan 2020,50,Smashing weekend stay,"Group of 7 ladies, the Santa Justa was a fab base for the weekend. Complimentary mini bar, custard tarts in the room on arrival,complimentary port an sparkling wine in the room too. Asked the reception staff to recommend a restaurant for lunch,and he directed us to a local taverna, which was very reasonable and excellent.Generous selection of toiletries in rooms. Breakfast was very good, except the hot selection was actually cold..mentioned it to staff, the following day it was warmer ,but still not hot.Needs to be monitored a little better."
Jan 2020,50,A perfect stay,"We had the great pleasure to stay here for five nights. The hotel is perfectly located in the middle of everything. Staff is very friendly and helpful, rooms (we were in the fifth floor) are stunning with nice view over the roofs of the neighborhood and plenty of space. Great place to stay, no caveats."
Jan 2020,50,Mr.Diaz,"Close to everything,perfect location,Staff speak diferent languages including english and spanish ,if you arrived at the hotel after 10 am the city closed the streets to cars so you need to walk with your luggage a about 100 feet,breakfast but no a problem for me buffet very good."
Jan 2020,50,"Excellent Location, Reasonably Priced, Great Service","Stayed five nights in ""New Wing"", which we'd recommend. Hotel upgraded us to Junior Suite on 3rd Flr. Room, bed, bathroom, shower - all very nice. Excellent location. Vy good windows and sound insulation so street noise from restaurant below had zero impact. Pricing is great. Staff at reception is excellent. We had Breakfast Package -- very good. Dinner at hotel restaurant was just okay, though staffing was excellent. One comment: Smell from Pinoquio Restaurant downstairs seeps into hall and into room. We mentioned to Reception and they offered to move us but we'd already unpacked. It wasn't a deal killer so we bought a scented candle, which helped. A great hotel."
Jan 2020,50,Best customer service,"This was our second time to stay at this hotel. After staying here the first time, it was a clear choice for us for future stays. Hotel is Very clean, has excellent customer service and very friendly staff."
Jan 2020,50,Great hotel in a great location,My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights in the summer while visiting. The hotel room was nice and clean and conveniently located in a highly trafficked area in Lisbon. We noted the safe wasn't working properly and they sent someone up to fix it relatively quickly. We had breakfast at the hotel one morning and food was decent. We were overall happy with our stay and would recommend to others.
Dec 2019,50,An Excellent Hotel,"We stayed here for 6 nights in room 601 over Christmas, 2019.  The room was clean, very comfortable, and had a small window with a great view.  All public transportation is within short walking distance.  The hotel's restaurant is very good.The staff was extremely friendly, accommodating, and very helpful with it came to answering our questions about Lisbon, and they gave us advice about things to do and places to eat when we asked.  Thanks, Ricardo!  You were correct 100% of the time!Oh, and the mini bar is included and restocked every day!  Woohoo!"
Dec 2019,50,"Perfect in every way - Comfortable, Impeccable Service, Great Food - highly recommend","We spent 4 nights with our 3 kids, and this was by far our favorite hotel of our whole trip - and honestly, of all vacations, I'd put it at the top of the list. Location - perfect - a block off the main road full of street entertainers, restaurants, shops, pastries, gelato, etc. So quiet in our rooms tho - so around the corner from the action, and a short walk to other sites, nightlife, etc. They included a beautiful European breakfast so we could fuel up quickly before hitting the road for the day. Service is impeccable - they greet you with a smile and can't wait to be helpful every time...Entire staff treated us so nicely. Wifi strong for checking in. Lobby restaurant had performers one night and a fabulous Fado performance another. MIni Bar included - so nice to grab waters, etc. without a hassle. They greeted us with Port wine & pastries & left champagne & chocolates and a sweet note on our last night.Beds so comfy & plush robes & oversized towels after enjoying a rainfall shower & top notch toiletries.I cannot recommend this hotel enough!!!  We're definitely value shoppers & don't love to overpay, and when we first looked, this seemed pricier than we wanted, but we went for it, hoping to maximize our touring time, and we are thrilled we made this choice. We were able to walk to virtually everything we wanted to do - or take a short taxi if needed.LOVE LOVE LOVE it & hope to return!"
Dec 2019,50,The Whole Package,"Location. Service. Cleanliness. Food. Personality. Memorable. These are the things you are looking for when on holiday....anywhere. SJ hit them all on the head. From check-in to check-out, impressed with staff. Special thanks to Nadia and the entire front desk team. Breakfast, concierge service, housekeeping and restaurant folks made us feel valued. GREAT VIBE all around. We travel a lot. Lots of 5 star hotels. This place made us feel 5 Star. Highly recommend."
Dec 2019,50,Excellent hotel,Great place for a 3 day stay during Xmas. Located in the heart of Downtown it offers many shops and restaurants in walking distance. The hotel itself is well decorated and the room spacious. Great and extensive buffet for breakfast not usually seen at hotels. Would stay here again in next visit to Lisbon
Dec 2019,50,Amazing hotel and location,"Thank you Ricardo and all the hotel team.It was an amazing stay at your hotel. Great staff, great room with an amazing bathroom. We were so lucky to find this hotel and it was the best one. The restaurantes on the street was also amazing. We did go to four different places and all great."
Dec 2019,50,Excellent Hotel,"I chose this hotel because of it's location as it is central to everything in the older area of Lisbon. Our room was upgraded to a suite, so space was not an issue. The room was very quiet, bed was very good quality, bathroom was beautiful. We had no problems at all. I must say that the staff at the front desk was great, always smiling, and able to help us plan out a few details of our trip. I would stay there again!"
Dec 2019,40,Family Holiday - first stopi,We started 3 weeks European holiday with Lisbon. First of all the location of the hotel is excellent and close to everything and we agreed to the breakfast at a discount price and the breakfast was OK and nothing to vouch for. There was one big problem with the hotel about their maintenance. I had two issues and both times I was told that the problem is fixed though they never fixed anything and the last day I had to change the room because they didn't fix the toilet problem which was reported  earlier in the day.Thanks
Dec 2019,50,Great Hotel,Perfect location in the old town close to everything. Didn't care for the restaurant dinners but the breakfast was good. Very friendly and helpful staff. Comfortable rooms and good size. Didn't like all the restaurants that line the streets when the waiters would try to get you to eat there and then would get aggressive if you said no so just had to ignore them but a few times walked the other way just to avoid them.
Dec 2019,50,Great stay and quiet night sleep,We picked the hotel based on the centralized location. Check-in was smooth and we were upgraded to a suite located across the street from the lobby that was spacious.  We were worried with a street facing room that there would be noise but it was very quiet. We opted for breakfast and the food was good with a decent variety.
Dec 2019,50,Great location and lovely Hotel,"A great hotel with friendly staff in a central location in the old part of Lisbon.  Situated  close to Rossio square, Praça do Comércio the underground and good restaurants along with the lovely old trams."
Nov 2019,50,Great location and Breakfast ,The hotel Santa Justa is in. Great location...can’t imagine a better location. The breakfast is great...I’d stay there just for the breakfast! The rooms are comfortable and quiet. Awesome value..I’d pay double
Nov 2019,50,"Rock solid, great location","Stayed for a couple of nights and the hotel was wonderful. The rooms were very quiet, you couldn’t hear any noise from the street. The ventilation system was working perfectly and very responsive to heating or cooling needs as opposed to some hotels where everything seems to take forever for temps to change.Front desk staff superbly professional and friendly. Great amenities in the room!  Including free drinks :)"
Nov 2019,50,Weekend break ,"Loved this hotel, central to everywhere, very convenient to anywhere you would want to visit . All forms of public transport within walking distance,  including airport bus. Staff were so friendly. Exceptionally clean. Will stay again on my next visit"
Nov 2019,50,Great stay,"We were shown to our room immediately although we arrived hours early. Time was taken to explain everything to us, from how to use the elevator to setting the safe. The bathroom was spacious, with loads of counter space and hooks. The staff was extremely helpful. We had the breakfast at the hotel one morning when we needed to get an early start. The buffet offerings were vast and delicious.  We also thought the hotel was in a good location and would definitely stay there again."
Nov 2019,50,Fantastic Location,We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The location was fantastic and staff always helpful. The breakfast was by far the best at any hotel we stayed at on our travels through Europe. Highly recommend.
Nov 2019,50,"Nice room, friendly staff, good breakfast","This hotel is not very big, and the athmosphere is nice. It is clean and rather newly decorated. It is situated very central, in a walking district, and still very close to public transportation. Very convinient. Nice fresh breakfast. Dinner restaurant: I can not recommend the codfish, too salty and well done for my taste."
Nov 2019,40,City break with family and friends,"We stayed at the hotel Santa Justa at the beginning of November , its was our annual city break with family . The Hotel location is excellent , central and within easy walking distance to some of the attractions and trams .The room was very nice with a large comfortable bed a large TV, coffee maker  (kettle on request) iron and board and hairdryer just about everything you could need. The room and bathroom were very clean and the house keeping was also very good.Breakfast was extensive and good value for money, unfortunately  we only ate in the restaurant once  on our last night and our meal was excellent , we wished that we had eaten there every night as we had a few very disappointing and expensive meals in restaurants outside the hotel .Overall we had a very good experience at this hotel  , the staff on reception and in the bar and restaurant were friendly efficient and happy to help with anything you needed. I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends."
Nov 2019,50,The heart of Lisbon,"Our itinerary brought us to Lisbon three times during a three week Portugal visit, each time in a different Lisbon hotel.  Hotel Santa Just a was our favorite.  It's small enough to be intimate; large enough to be gracious in its accommodations.  Our room had a view of the Castle S. George.  The location is fantastic for walking central Lisbon, and the staff are exceptional in their hospitality.  The amenities were unexpected and first rate.  We would look forward to more time in Lisbon, and we would look forward to more time staying at Hotel Santa Justa."
Nov 2019,40,Wonderful location,"Just returned from The Hotel Santa Justa in Lisbon. It’s a great location, looking up the avenue you can see the Santa Justa Lift. The hotel is clean and neat, but found the rooms dark. There is only one full length mirror in the room and it’s in the bathroom. We were in room 410. See photo s’s from our balcony. The restaurant has nice breakfast, but, the room is an unusual shape and feels cramped. We thought there may be renovations going on, so maybe they are redesigning the dining room. The outdoor dining area is nice to sit and have a drink. They have heaters that can take the chill out on a cool evening. There are no cooked to order omelettes, but the selections in the buffet are adequate.Overall a nice hotel."
Nov 2019,50,Really Enjoyed my Stay at Hotel Santa Justa!  Great location.,"It was a great stay and such a perfect location to visit the city for the first time.  The staff is so helpful and friendly.  I missed a connection and was delayed a day in arriving.  When I called to confirm what had happened, they assured me all was well...no worries.  I booked a tour and took a brief nap beforehand.  When I did not pick up my wake up call quick enough, front desk came over to make sure I was up and okay.  Wow!  As for the location, I loved it.  It was right in the historic area, easy to navigate.  It staff in the restaurant was also top notch.  Very accommodating.  Would definitely visit again and I highly recommend!"
Nov 2019,50,One Night Stay Before Cruise....,"My wife and I stayed here for one night. Right in the middle of everything, easy walk to restaurants and river.  Rooms are nice size for Europe.  Breakfast buffet is great with lots of choices.  Staff is friendly and very accommodating.  I would recommend this place."
Nov 2019,50,Great Experince,The location of the hotel was exceptional. big rooms compare to average European hotels room size. super friendly staff specially Olga - she made sure to make our first stay memorable. I strongly recommend staying at this hotel
Nov 2019,50,Lovely Hotel in heart of Lisbon,Great location. More restaurants than one can possibly choose. Plenty of action and close proximity to everything. Staff was very helpful in arranging a tour to Sintra and Nazare. Enjoyed a Fado dinner one evening and jazz on another.
Nov 2019,50,Great location on pedestrian street,"We like staying at Santa Justa when traveling to Lisbon. The location is perfect for walks to all downtown attractions. The pedestrian street where the hotel is located has become almost full of restaurant tables. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the breakfast is good. Very nice staff.We had dinner once in the hotel restaurant, and would not go back."
Nov 2019,50,Wonderful stay,"Loved the larger room, personal attention, FREE honor bar, good wi-fi, with a great location.We stayed in a room across the walkway from the lobby, but had no issues.Bottom Line: Would be my 1st choice when visiting Lisbon."
Oct 2019,50,"Fabulous location, great hotel.","Great hotel, situated right in the centre of the old town. My room was big, modern, very clean and on a quiet side street. Bed was very comfortable. Staff is very helpful. Didn’t try the restaurants but they look very busy and good. Parking is available at a nearby car park for a reduced rate. Would definitely go back."
Oct 2019,50,Excellent stay,"We stayed in this hotel last week. We had a wonderful time. The room was very comfortable and thanks for the upgrade. The staff at the hotel were great, very friendly and helpful and welcoming, I loved the fado music. There was a member of staff in the bar of the evening who was brilliant I'm sorry I didn't get his name but he was 10 out of 10. It's members of staff like him that makes us recommend to other people. Thanks again we had a blast"
Oct 2019,50,Wonderful!,"My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon and the hotel was great! They were super helpful and great service, & even left a few treats in our room for the honeymoon. Perfect location to get around Lisbon. Thank you!"
Oct 2019,50,Great Hotel and Location,"We stay in this small boutique hotel for 3 nights and were very satisfied. The hotel is in the pedestrian zone of historic Lisbon. The room is comfortable, stylish with a lovely welcome pastry and the mini fridge with water, beer and juice, and a bottle of red wine are all complementary.The hotel staff were phenomenal, friendly and answered all our questions.Highly recommended!"
Oct 2019,50,Lovely Lisbon,"Romantic break in Lisbon was fantastic. From the moment we arrived  the staff were welcoming,professional,and knowledgeable. At breakfast we received a warm welcome and the selection offered was amazing. The level of comfort and attention to detail was delightfull. As it was a special trip for us a complementry bottle of port and chocolates and a special card touched us deeply. The central location made ease of movement for sightseeing and selection of shops and places to eat so accessible. I will definatly be back and i am reccomending  Santa Justa to everyone."
Oct 2019,40,A very nice hotel in the center of town.,This hotel is ideally located in Lisbon.  The staff members are all friendly and professional.  The facility and rooms are quite nice and very quiet and comfortable.  We were in a corner room that had wonderful full height windows that could be opened which made our four night stay more enjoyable than expected.  The front officer staff was very helpful with tour and transfer planning prior to arrival.
Oct 2019,50,Superb restaurant,We didn’t stay at the hotel but came across the restaurant one evening and chose to eat there. The food and wine were excellent. The servers spoke exceptional English and were were friendly and very attentive. We had a superb meal and evening. In fact it was so good we went back two nights later for our last evening in Lisbon and had another truly amazing meal. Highly recommended.
Oct 2019,50,Better than expected,"I stayed one night at this property, but was completely blown away by the customer service. I arrived kind of early, but lucked out with a room being available for me to check-in. I also arrived without luggage, thanks to an issue with my flights, and the hotel was able to wash the clothes that I traveled in very quickly. The hotel is located a little over a block away from the Rossio station.I also needed to take an early morning taxi to the airport and they were able to advise on an appropriate time to leave and schedule a taxi pick-up for that time (the taxi driver was there at the scheduled time). The room I stayed in has probably seen better days, but it was clean and I was able to relax and sleep well that evening. It also had a neat view of the rooftops of the neighborhood. I will definitely consider staying at this hotel the next time I’m in Lisbon."
Oct 2019,50,Lovely Hotel in the heart of Lisbon,We had a wonderful four night stay. The location was perfect and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was amazing. Very comfortable with a balcony. Loved opening the french doors in the morning to enjoy coffee on the balcony to enjoy the view below. We had an awesome time and the Hotel Santa Justa exceeded our expectations.
Oct 2019,50,Perfect Choice,"Loved this small european hotel.  It's situated perfectly to get anywhere in the center of downtown.  It's friendly, clean, and the staff is very accommodating.  They provide Fado music 3 nights a week. Our room was modern and very quiet with a nice view.  Loved the shower!  Wonderful nespresso was provided daily, as was the contents in the mini-fridge, ALL included in the room's price.  We had opted to not eat in the restaurant, because we spent many days there and explored other options."
Oct 2019,50,Great location,"The hotel is located in baixa and an easy walk to the city's attractions.  Our room was large and clean and the rate included the mini bar items (pop, water, beer) as well as breakfast. Breakfast had both hot and cold items and a wonderful pastry bar.  Dinner recommendations from the front desk were also good and included  cozy neighborhood spot with reasonable prices."
Oct 2019,40,Very nice updated rooms.,"This was probably the nicest room in all the hotels that we visited in Spain and Portugal on our 11 day trip. It had everything that you needed and it was very modernized.  The negative:   The location is in the City Center, which I have to admit I wasn’t crazy about but for sure it was centrally located.   While our room was on a high floor, as I requested, my view was of an apartment that looked like a homeless shelter.   Just didn’t look out the window so it was fine.   Not the hotel’s fault but just a fact of being in Lisbon."
Oct 2019,40,The perfect hotel to stay in Lisbon,I have been in Lisbon any times but I had never stay in downtown. This hotel is a surprise. I have been in a suite and it was perfect. Roomy and classy. Everything is perfect. It is located in the real heart of the city close to everything. During the night seems to be in Trastevere with all the life you can find. Will go again!
Oct 2019,40,Beyond expectations,"Excellent location in Baixa, quiet (although it resides on the city center), very good service, clean, and very nice rooms (small though). We were 4 people in 2 rooms, staying for 8 nights. Just perfect!"
Oct 2019,50,We Love Lisbon and the Hotel Santa Justa,"Wonderful experience here....great location, clean and comfortable rooms, hotel staff superb! The in-house breakfast was delicious, with optimum choices of fresh fruit, wonderful bread for toasting and pastries.We would especially like to cite the professionalism and kindness of Hugo Simoes and Mariana Guindango. Hugo directed us to some wonderful restaurants in Lisbon, where we enjoyed delicious Portuguese food and wine. Most times we were surrounded by locals so we knew we had found a great restaurant. Mariana, always with a smile, was ready to assist us with any questions. The hostess in the morning (not sure of her name) was  also gracious in welcoming us each morning.We mention also with much enthusiasm Edwardo and his group who introduced us to Fado on Sunday and Tuesday evenings. What beautiful music....we loved it so much that upon our return to LIsbon after visiting the country, we enjoyed the music on our last evening in Portugal. I will never forget the sounds and the magical feeling in the hotel on those nights of beautiful music. I hope they are able to put together a disc....I would love to hear again those sounds here in my home."
Oct 2019,40,Enjoyed Our Stay,"We stayed three nights at this boutique hotel.  Great central location, close to many shops, restaurants and landmarks. An excellent base to explore the city. Our room was clean and comfortable. Friendly and very helpful front desk staff.  The live Fado music at the Hotel’s restaurant really added to our enjoyment of the evening.  Overall, a wonderful choice for our visit to Lisbon."
Oct 2019,50,excellent hotel,"very friendly and helpful staff.  i had problems with parcels i was waiting on from the UK.  They phoned the courier company for me and helped me to sort problems out. i would definitely stay here again.  The breakfasts were well laid out, plenty to choose from.  The bathroom was very clean and a good size.  The bedding was very nice as well."
Oct 2019,40,Convenient and centrally located,"We stayed for 5 days in the hotel. The hotel consists of two premises separated by a clean street, both are modern style. We stayed in the Junior Suite. It was smaller than expected. The bathroom was about 80-100sq ft, but the shower room was a bit  small.  The bed and sofa were comfort but the room lacked stylish colour nor decoration. The complementary mini bar contains 3 bottles of water, one Cola, one beer and one mango juice. The room was quiet at night. The metro and the tram and bus terminal was just 3 mins away in the Figueira square. The Rossio train station ( to Sintra) was just 5-7mins walking distance.  Every morning, we enjoyed breakfast in the hotel. The variety of the breakfast was ok, with hot egg, sausage, ham, mushroom, a lot of bread, 4-5 choices of fruit. But the choices remain almost the same for 5 days. After the breakfast, we went everywhere as day trip because we were closed to different transportation systems. By evening, we enjoyed dinner at down town, and walked along Rua da Prata where a lot of shops, ice cream, cafe located. We felt safe at night. It was a really enjoyable stay."
Oct 2019,50,The BEST,"I picked this hotel solely on the TA photo of the pretty front door and that they had WiFi!Thank goodness I did! Everything was first class.The staff, especially at reception, could not have been better. They bent over backward to give you anything you need.  Hugo and Joao really made our visit special.The breakfast was fabulous every morning. We had two dinners also which were also outstanding.The bathrooms are fabulous! Nice amenities, as well as a powerful hairdryer, were most welcome.The mini bar is free, don’t get excited it’s all water and juices, no chocolate!! There’s a Nespresso machine and hot water tea pot too.The rooms are quiet, even facing the street. I stayed in both buildings, there are newer rooms across the street. Beds very comfortable.The location is convenient to everything. Do not miss the Mercado de Ribiera for a culinary extravaganza. I had an amazing cheeseburger and fries. It’s only a 20 minute walk from Hotel SJ.I hope you choose this gem of a hotel while visiting Lisbon."
Oct 2019,50,Lisbon Center,"Great location, excellent service, lovely accommodations! Room amenities were an extra touch to make our stay delightful.  We would definitely return. Staff were interested in making us feel very welcomed."
Sep 2019,50,Great location and service!,"I booked the San Justa Hotel for my parent's stay in Lisbon since they had been away from Portugal for 50 years. They were amazed for the great location, for the available and polite staff, clean rooms and a wide selection of food for breakfast, In addition, the San Justa Hotel was so thoughtful that they upgraded the room reservation. Thank you very much for having made my parent's stay in Lisbon unforgettable.Sabrina Isabel"
Sep 2019,50,Very comfortable in the heart of the city,"Outstanding choice. Central to everything and right in the heart of the city. Great breakfast included, clean rooms, great shower and comfortable beds. Bathroom was large with plenty of counter space, big shower towels and excellent AC. Staff was helpful and polite.  Definite winner."
Sep 2019,50,"Great stay, great location!","We had a great stay in this centrally located hotel. The hotel is conveniently situated in the pedestrianised downtown area of Lisbon close to the Santa Justa lift, making it an excellent base to explore Lisbon from. Our room was very spacious (we were upgraded to a suite in building 2 with street view) and the bed was very comfortable and we slept well. The bathroom was also very well appointed with a great shower and nice towels and complimentary toiletries. Breakfast was excellent with a good selection of both cooked to continental options, fresh fruit and cakes/pastries... usually including scrummy custard tarts :-) The staff were very friendly and welcoming and were more than happy to help with any queries that we had. We thoroughly recommend this hotel for a stay in Lisbon."
Sep 2019,50,Amazing lady stay in Europe ,"This was the last leg of our Europe holiday staying here for 4 nights. What a modern, clean and spacious room. And many unexpected extras that really make you stay very special like the wonderful mini nata’s and port waiting for us in our room including a special cosmetic gift. The room had an excellent balcony overlooking the restaurants and modern large bathroom. Only slight negative was the bath shower which had a large step to get into. Can be slippery. The staff are very very helpful guiding you through the supplied map and attractions. Will be staying here again for sure."
Sep 2019,50,Great Hotel and Location,"As there are so many hotels in Lisbon, it took me a long time to decide which hotel we will go to for a week. Even before we arrived in Lisbon, they emailed us for some information we might need. They told us that cars might not be able to come right in the front of the hotel. They asked us if we needed hotel transfer from the airport which we did. And asked us if we want to include breakfast buffet package for a discounted price if we reserved it ahead of time.  The location was great. It was very centrally located to everything you would want to visit in Lisbon. It was walking distance to a lot of attractions.  The staff was very helpful in providing assistance about what to see and do around Lisbon.  We opted for the transfer from the airport to the hotel. The driver parked at a square near the hotel and someone from the hotel met us by the square and walked us to the hotel. We arrived before check in time and they held our luggage and gave us a map and tried to show us the different neighborhoods we might want to visit and some restaurant recommendations. When we came back they've taken our luggage to our room.  Our room was very nice and clean and the service was outstanding.  The breakfast buffet was great! They have music at dinner time at certain nights of the week. We also ate at their restaurant and the food was really good. There was one day during our stay that it was raining a little. They gave us umbrellas to borrow for the day. I am really glad I picked this hotel.  I highly recommend it and  I will definitely stay in this hotel again."
Sep 2019,50,Great location and front desk staff,"We were in Lisbon for 3 nights and were very satisfied with our stay here. Comfortable, stylish room with a lovely welcome pastry and bottle of port. Great, extremely central location. There is Fado music (thought it seemed to be more upbeat than tradition Fado - maybe Portuguese folk music) in the restaurant a few nights a week and we really enjoyed that. We leaned on the front desk staff to guide us several times and they were great. There were two guys, both named Hugo, who were particularly helpful. My husband asked for a recommendation of where he should go watch an American football game. Hugo called the place ahead of time to confirm our game would be on. Going to that bar was one of the highlights of the trip for my husband - he had a blast. Thank you!"
Sep 2019,40,Great location in center of pedestrian area,"Hotel Santa Justa was an easy place to stay in the middle of everything. A short walk to most plazas, cafes, restaurants, and the waterfront, I'd definitely stay there again. The hotel didn't have many amenities like a fitness room, free breakfast, or pool, but the room was great and location perfect."
Sep 2019,50,Wonderful Stay,"We enjoyed our stay immensely and the staff members were friendly and attentive.  They answered all the questions we had about visiting Lisbon.  We unexpectedly got a room upgrade which made our stay very comfortable.  I appreciated the modern style and cleanliness.  The room was super quiet even though we were right next to the elevator.  The breakfasts were excellent and the woman in charge of the breakfast room was so charming and helpful. The location was great - close to everything.  However, many of the nearby restaurants had hucksters standing in the middle of the road accosting you and shoving their menus in front of your face.  It was disturbing at first but we learned to joke with them.  I know the hotel can't control what happens outside their doors.  I was disappointed with the dinner at the hotel, but the management actually cared and addressed the problem quickly and professionally.  I would stay at this hotel again."
Sep 2019,50,Excellent ,"Hotel was fantastic. Very clean. Breakfast was awesome so much variety. Free mini bar and a free bottle of Port to share topped the experience. We had originally booked else where and they over booked so we were given this hotel as an option for replacement. So happy with the outcome and I feel we got better than what was originally booked. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. We had a private tour organised by them last minute and it was fantastic. They gave great advise on the area and where we were what was close by etc. picture is a view from our room enjoying a beer from the free mini bar! 10/10 from me would definitely stay here again! Thanks so much Lucy Adelaide, Australia"
Sep 2019,50,Excellent location,Hotel Santa Justa is located within walking distance of the Commercial Plaza and Rossio Square. Lots of great shopping and dining nearby. Our room was very comfortable and very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful and served a nice breakfast.
Sep 2019,50,Great place to stay,"Fantastic location one block from the main drag from the river to the touristy downtown historic and shopping area (Rua Augusta). Excellent English and they recommended good walks and restaurants nearby. Breakfast was plentiful, a mix of English and European breakfast items. Clean, quiet and great WiFi and a/c. Literally at least 100 restaurants within 1 mile. Great area to stroll, view historical sites, and shop. Very pleased."
Sep 2019,50,Great place to eat.,"The hotel is on the corner of Rua dos Correiros, a street dotted with restaurants, most of which have staff waving menus of indifferent food at inflated prices. Try this hotel, we have eaten here twice in the last week. Excellent food, beautifully presented at excellent value. Yes, I know it is a hotel but.......try it and be enlightened. The wine selection is excellent  and I recommend the Sendinhas Tinto Copo."
Sep 2019,50,The Perfect Boutique Hotel,"Dear fellow travelers, my husband and I received a warm welcome at check in and an upgrade to a suite, and wine and sweet Portuguese treats were awaiting in our room. The bath offered quality shampoo, conditioner and body wash. And the free mini bar -- every day - was a real bonus! Although the hotel is very central in the city and in a tourist-filled area, it felt very safe and comfortable. Breakfast was abundant and fresh. Just outside the hotel you can walk the stone streets and find shops and amazing restaurants and cafes. A note about arrival...remember the hotel is on a pedestrian-only street. We arrived around 11:45pm and our driver had to drop us off around the corner and we walked the rest of the way. We stayed for three nights and loved it very much. A favorite stay for us during our vacation in Portugal."
Sep 2019,50,Top treatment,We booked a 9 days stay at this Hotel in the very down town Lisbon. Fantastic staff. Wonderful breakfast! Refill of minibar free of charge every day. We will for sure serach up this hotel again if we go to Lisbon again!
Sep 2019,50,Excellent,"The hotel is located at the center of Lisbon, which is very nice. The rooms are amazing, and the breakfast is awesome.My stay here was excellent, even better than i expected. Come here and you won’t be disappointed; highly recommended!"
Sep 2019,50,Great place to stay!,"This was one of the best hotels we’ve stayed at! We arrived early prior to check in and were allowed to store our luggage until check in time. When we returned, our luggage had already been stowed in our room and there was free wine and pastries awaiting us. We stayed in a family room, which was two adjoining rooms, one with a couch/sitting area. The rooms were clean, comfortable and the air conditioning was great. The location of the hotel is excellent, within a 5 min walk to many areas and restaurants just outside the door. Access to public transportation (trams, trains, buses and metro-we took all of them!) was just a 1-2 min walk away.  The hotel staff were phenomenal, friendly and answered all of our questions. They even ordered a taxi for us and then escorted us to the car to be sure we could find it. We found the wait staff to be equally as pleasant and the food was delicious and reasonably priced. Shoutout to Hugo at the front desk for being especially helpful and kind! We would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Lisboa and would sya here ourselves again in a heartbeat!"
Sep 2019,40,Great location,"The location of this hotel is great, in part because it is close to Lisbon's many forms of public transportation (train, tram, metro, buses, elevators, and funiculars!). It is a short walk down the wonderfully picturescque cobblestone Rua Augusta (which is full of sidewalk restaurants) to Praça de Comercio, where you'll find many more restaurants, right on the plaza by the river. (Populi was one of our favorites.) The hotel itself is very nice and clean, and the breakfast buffet selection is absolutely solid. The restaurant is surprisingly good, too, which fado performances a few times a week. Customer service at the hotel was good; they made reservations for us upon request, answered questions, and offered to show us everything in the room (literally down to how to use the safe - maybe some people need this instruction?). Check-in was smooth. The bathtub/shower situation might be a little tough for older folks or people with disabilities, as it is a bit of a large step up to get into it. My only real complaint would be that the a/c is not great. There is no thermostat, per se, but a dial on the wall that isn't the most intuitive thing in the world, which would be fine if it kept things cool, but even when we were cranking it up (we were there in August) it wasn't stellar. Overall, though, great location."
Sep 2019,50,"Great Hotel, Great Location and Great service","This small boutique hotel was so awesome. In the pedestrian zone of historic Lisbon, this hotel had everything we wanted. They had put so much thought into the layout, the amenities, services etc. For example, they had a mini fridge with water(still and carbonated) beer and juice, and a bottle of red wine on the guest table plus some pastries. All for free. The layout of the standard room was great and bigger than standard European rooms. They had cloth hooks everywhere, iron and ironing board in the room (unlike some other hotels where you have to ask one from the front desk). They even had three different kind of electrical plugs (receptacle) including one for our American appliances (phones etc) so we didn’t need to have an adaptor for it. And the service was excellent and everyone from the hotel staff was so pleasant and helpful."
Sep 2019,50,An excellent choice!,"Arriving on the Aerobus into Rossio it was less than 5 minutes easy walk with our two cases to the hotel.  Although we arrived early, they kindly let us have our room straight away.  We were in room 310 which is a large room at the corner with a huge marble bathroom.  The room was very comfortable.  The curtains made the room nice and dark for sleeping and the double glazed windows ensured little street noise to disturb.  The aircon worked well.  If you don’t want to use the aircon and want the windows open then you will hear the noise of the busy restaurants on the streets below.The bathroom even had scales so you can watch the weight stacking on during your stay in Lisbon!We did not eat breakfast in the hotel but it looked like a good selection at the buffet.This is one of the more expensive hotels we stayed in this trip and it is not a five star hotel but it is well located, well renovated and decorated and has lots of character."
Sep 2019,50,Great!,"The best location to stay in Lisbon.  Staff very friendly and helpful.The rooms we stayed were little small but with small nice balcony and very cozy. bed is very comfortable.We’ll come again for sure , thank you"
Sep 2019,50,"Location, location, location!","Top three things about this hotel:1. The location - I loved the central location of this hotel. It was close to excellent shopping, metro stations that connect you to Sintra (or even Cascais if you want to walk a bit further), and great restaurants. Although you can't get dropped to the front door, it's a <60 second walk to the closest street to catch a taxi/uber. 2. The rooms - Very comfortable rooms, with all the amenities you need. The included minibar that was restocked everyday was a nice touch! The safe is large and could fit my 15"" MBP. The bathroom was spacious. The view was excellent. Everything was spotless. What more could you ask for?3. The hotel restaurant (Elevador) - This restaurant is totally underrated. It's a classy establishment. I really liked how they didn't force people walking by to eat there, like the other restaurants on the street did. The food (and live entertainment) spoke for itself! The waitresses/waiters were kind, patient, and helpful. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Lisbon!"
Sep 2019,50,Brilliant ,Fab location right in the city centre near the elevator landmark and 2 amazing squares 1 where you get taxis / tuc tucs / bus and metro the 2nd where you relax with a coffee and custard cake and watch people visiting the theatre and the many nearby shops restaurants and landmarks. We stayed in the new hotel section -bedroom was maybe on the smaller side but that’s what we paid for (bigger at more cost is available) but what we had was very comfy great bed loads of storage air con flat screen tv hairdryer coffee machine and the en suite was brilliant As others have said the hotel exceeded our expectations with a small complimentary mini bar 2 beers 2 cokes 2 water each day plus wine on arrival - cava and chocolates on departure Staff were really smiley and helpful 5 stars for me would 100% recommend- wish I was there now 😩
Aug 2019,40,"Very nice, central, but a bit smelly","Hotel was a great stay as far as size and quality of rooms, comfy beds and nice linens, room was on 5th floor with lovely window with views. Yet, there was a foul smell coming from the bathroom, which they should fix."
Aug 2019,50,Great location for first visit to Lisbon,Central hotel in Biaxa Chiado area. Great rooms. In the middle of the action but with soundproof glass. Open door to small balcony to hear street and see and smell the city and close it to sleep soundly. Great staff. Good rest on premises and many within walking distance.
Aug 2019,50,THE place to eat if in Lisbon,"Found the lovely Santa Justa Hotel restaurant in Rua dos Correeiros after studying the many (mostly all the same) menus of many restaurants in the location.  We visited twice during our stay it was so good.  Amazing staff, pristine linen tablecloths and napkins.  Attentive service and very good wines.  My beef was cooked to perfection with a very good menu choice.  A great ambience.  My aunt and I highly recommend this restaurant.  We were not staying at this hotel but I can say it looked sparkling clean inside and very comfortable and I would stay there on another visit."
Aug 2019,50,Excellent experience,"We loved our stay at Hotel Santa Justa so much so that we extended staying there instead of moving to another area. It was like home away from home. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous. The rooms are extremely comfortable. It’s in the heart of Lisbon so you can just walk out to enjoy what Lisbon is all about! Highly recommended, will stay again."
Aug 2019,50,"Excellent hotel, thoroughly recommended. ","We are just about to spend the third of four nights here. I cannot think of anything negative to say. The location is superb, as it is in the heart of the Bairro Alto district of Lisbon, on a pedestrian only street but only half a block away from a traffic road. Although it is in the middle of the hustle and bustle, it is very quiet inside. The staff are all friendly and helpful. The room is very comfortable. The mini bar is stocked with water, some pop and beer and is “free”, i. e. no added charge, which is a first for us. The buffet breakfast, included in our reasonable room price, is extremely good. We have just had an excellent dinner in the dining room. There is free wifi. We had booked this hotel several months ago and received a welcome letter from the hotel containing good information about the hotel and transportation to and from.  This was much appreciated. Most of the sights are within walking distance. You do not need a car here."
Aug 2019,50,Great stay,"We had a great stay at this hotel.  It is very centrally located so getting around Lisbon was really simple.  The hotel itself is not very large, but the rooms are fairly spacious and clean.  When we were there, the mini-bar was free and restocked every day.  We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Lisbon."
Aug 2019,50,Great location! ,"The hotel is in the city center so it’s easy to get to all the landmarks whether by walking or Uber! We also did a I Go Portugal private tour to Sintra because of a flyer we saw in the lobby. The tour picked us up from the hotel lobby and dropped us back to the lobby after a very eventual and exciting day. The complimentary breakfast buffet in the morning was great, had everything expect my husband was disappointed there was no omelette station but it’s understandable as that would be hard to accommodate. The room was very nice and we received a complimentary upgrade, my husband and I had a lot of fun with the blinds in the standing shower which was a unique feature. They replenished the mini bar daily and it was all complimentary, which was nice because it was so hot outside so we always grabbed a water bottle to take with us on our walks. We asked for a later checkout which they extended to 1pm, which was really considerate because our flight is at 6pm. We were also able to check in early at about 11:30am without even informing them of early arrival so that was really amazing because a lot of the time they tell you to come back. We were able to check in and relax and unpack after traveling. While the area surrounding hotel is very commercial with lots of restaurants that didn’t seem all that appetizing, we did find a few local gems that we enjoyed. We really enjoyed our night walks around the hotel. It was a great stay!"
Aug 2019,50,Excellent location. Great service. Delicious breakfast.,"It lies in the heart of Lisbon's Baixa district and is in proximity to all traffic connections: bus tour, tram tour, metro station and public buses and tram. Staff members are overwhelmingly friendly and helpful. Room (double room in building 1) is spacious and comfortable. Breakfast is excellent with a vast variety of choices."
Aug 2019,50,Highly recommend this hotel,"Santa Justa is in the heart of Lisbon, 2-3 mins walk from the Rua Augusta Arch and Main Street. 12  mins walk from the castle and right at the doorstep of all the fabulous restaurants and cafe’s.  The hotel itself is perfection, so very clean, very modern and tastefully decorated. The staff are very friendly and always there to answer any questions. We received a welcome gift of Portuguese pastries in our room and also a farewell gift - These little details added to our stay. Hotel is also very reasonable price wise. I loved this hotel and I will definitely be back."
Aug 2019,50,Terrific 4 star boutique hotel. ,We found this hotel through trip advisor. It is the best 4 star hotel we have stayed in.  Well located. Multiple great restaurants nearby and in the hotel.  The morning free breakfast is the best.   Close to shopping and sites. Very pleasant and accommodating staff. While the hotel is located in a busy area the rooms are quiet. One minor complaint. The toilets are very low.
Aug 2019,50,Great Stay,We stayed eight nights at this hotel without any problems.  The bed was comfortable.   Good housekeeping.  Friendly staff.  Excellent food.  The hotel is centrally located in the middle of many restaurants and shops.   We will definitely stay here again.
Aug 2019,50,Good location in Lisbon,"Hotel Santa Justa is a very nice hotel located in the heart of the tourist area of Lisbon. Access is via pedestrian streets only so you nee do walk a short distance. The hotel is quite charming and the staff was excellent, very helpful and courteous. The rooms were nice, and had good amenities. The floors are tile, so a bit cold and the pillows could use an upgrade but the bathrooms were very nice and the room included anything in the minibar."
Aug 2019,50,Top Location. Top Service. If back in Lisboa we go there!,"Really great experience. Lots of additional ‚details‘ / nice things. Free minibar. Good WiFi. Nespresso machine. Good bye surprise.  Great modern and super clean room. Great bathroom. Combined with top location (be aware it‘s in a pedestrian area of you plan to come with car or good amount of luggage. Reception is very helpful, just let them know). Great - for sure again if back in Lisboa!"
Aug 2019,50,Excellent experience!,"I took a while to select an Hotel in Lisboa, wanted great location and quality and found them in Santa Justa Hotel, the best of it was the experience, the staff was very helpful and nice, they really care about the guest, at the end made my stay the best, next time for sure I will be staying here, even though is in the heart of the city center is a very quiet place."
Jul 2019,50,Everything was Perfect!,"A little gem among the cobbled streets of the old town. The friendly, welcoming, helpful staff are a credit to this lovwly boutique hotel. Great breakfast and breakfast staff and a host of little surprises throughout your stay. The complimentary minibar is a nice touch too. Loved the place and I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
Jul 2019,30,kind staffs and nice location but the rest is not really good,"Super kind staffs and nice location, but there're only a few kinds of food at breakfast, and the fruits were NOT FRESH (this is because all the refrigerated food such as fruit, cheese, ham, etc. are put outside at 3am.... I saw staff putting the food outside at this time), room quality is very normal, nothing special to say, Fado live performance was not really good...."
Jul 2019,30,Average,"I arrived at the hotel and immediately had to check my math. First I was charged 50 EUR for an early check in, fair enough-ish. Then when I gained access to WiFi I saw I was being overcharged by over 100 EUR per night and had to ask for the advertised price match displayed on the homepage. When the numbers didn’t add up, the concierge asked “oh, you want the price match for both nights?” Seriously?!? I never received an itemized bill either. Pros: The room itself was fine. Breakfast was good. Fruit-infused water in lobby during day. Good locationCons: The view consisted of a shirtless guy in flip flops on the terrace drying his laundry.Someone drank and left an empty beer in the minibarThe restaurants near and around hotel are not good quality and are pushy trying to get customers. We avoided these streets as much as possible"
Jul 2019,50,One of the best!,One of the best city centre hotels I have ever stayed in. Great location and very high standard. The staff have all been exceptional. The breakfast is fresh and delicious and the room is an exceptional standard. They surprise you with little touches such as free minibar drinks and Portuguese pastries in your room. I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough - come and enjoy!
Jul 2019,40,Great small hotel,"We shared a larger room that had a Queen bed or equivalent and pull-out couch. Both very comfortable! The location is wonderful!! If you rent a car, a public parking garage real close by is available. The breakfast buffet is great and staff is so friendly! We loved it!! Olga serving at the breakfast buffet was always very helpful and super  friendly and so were Hugo and Nadia at the Front Desk! Great assets to the hotel!"
Jul 2019,40,Good Hotel in the Heart of Baixa,"We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Santa Justa. It was centrally located in the heart of the Baixa, Chiado and Alfama areas and made for easy walking to those areas. It was a bit more congested than we typically like though. Lots of restaurant ""barkers"" along the beautiful walk street - ""No Abrigada"" became a common refrain while walking to another location. Easy to get to the train/transit station.The hotel is self was wonderful. Only things missing for us were a lounge/common area to sit in to have a casual drink (did have a wonderful restaurant, but that was more formal). Service was great. Wonderful breakfast buffet. Family accommodations were perfect."
Jul 2019,50,Amazing! ,Not enough word to express how nice is this place and the people definitely 5 star hotel!!!Lovely will come back!  Stayed there for 6 nights and felt like home! Didn’t want to leave lol!!! My kids love the breakfast and the place is spotless clean and modern.
Jul 2019,50,Weekend city break,"Lisbon is a great place to visit, was surprised what a big tourist destination it is, and how well geared up they are, plenty to see and do in a relatively small area, picked hotel largely on location which is ideal for those walking or using public transport. After awful journey we were made very welcome by receptionists at hotel and immediately provided with local info and taken up to superior room in the old attic space, unusual shape but very comfortable, top notch toiletries etc and a little balcony from which to look across the city! Excellent hotel in a fantastic location, pedestrianised area, loads of restaurants etc and easy walk to the riverside, really enjoyed our stay"
Jul 2019,50,Nice hotel with a good location ,"Very friendly staff, nice rooms. The breakfast is a bit too expensive for what is offered. Tasty compliments upon check-in, including a small bottle of Porto. If you travel by car, the parking is very close. The hotel is in downtown, lots of shops, bars and sightseeing."
Jul 2019,40,Good hotel in a great location.,"We enjoyed the property but we thought it had one drawback. The ground floor restaurant precludes common area for reading, talking or waiting for the maid service to get done. Big feature is a wonderful open market right around the corner."
Jul 2019,50,Amazing gem in Lisboa!,"We absolutely loved this hotel! The service and friendliness was amazing and having stayed at hotels around the world, this gem  is brilliant. Perfect location in the old town, close to the tram 12, 28 and 15 (5 min walk max). Breakfast was excellent! We will definitely be coming back !!Thank you for a wonderful start to our family vacation!!"
Jul 2019,50,A lovely hotel in an Excellent Location,"My wife and I stayed at Santa Justa Lisboa (Lisbon) for 10 nights from the 17th of June to the 27th of June 2019. The location is excellent - close to many restaurants, shops and transport facilities. It is on a pedestrianized street. The buffet breakfast is very good. Their restaurant - Restaurante Elevador – is very good. Our upgraded room was very clean, well-insulated from street noise and had coffee and tea making facilities. The shower follows very well. The staff members of the hotel are friendly, very professional and very helpful. They are excellent. The only downside is that the double bed, although comfortable, is not a true single double bed."
Jun 2019,50,Perfect start to vacation,"Hotel Santa Justa was lovely in every way. We could not have been happier with our stay. The staff was warm and welcoming, (including a welcome gift!), the room was very comfortable and the breakfast buffet beyond expectations! Also centrally located and an easy walk to the train, trams, and bus stop. An overall wonderful experience."
Jun 2019,50,Wonderful Location in Lisbon,"Hotel Santa Justa is perfectly located in the heart of Lisbon with numerous restaurants and close to many local attractions including the Elevator, The Castle of St. George and the beautiful Lisbon waterfront at Commerce Plaza. The rooms are well appointed with great bathrooms and some rooms also have balconies. The morning breakfast buffet is also great!!"
Jun 2019,40,Lisbon Visit,"We chose HSJ for its proximity to central Lisbon and rating.  It was a very good experience.  The rooms were clean and quiet.  Restaurant breakfast was very good each morning, it costs 15eu per person.  You might want to chose a room package that is inclusive of breakfast buffet.  Afternoons/evening in the restaurant area included live Fado music. Nice experience.  Dinner food and service was good. Central location to tourist areas, cabs, restaurants.  Staff helpful with directions and sites.  I would stay again."
Jun 2019,50,Great Hotel,"Just returned from a 5 day stay at The Santa Justa hotel. Great central location, taxis, trams & buses just a short walk away in Figueira square at the back of the hotel. Hotel lovely and clean. We were upgraded to a suite at no extra cost, a lovely big comfy room, which was very nice. All hotel staff super friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast very good, great selection. Nice touches with free beers, cola and water in mini fridge, port and nata tarts on arrival and cava and chocolates on last night. Had a lovely time in Lisbon lots to see and do. Would definitely recommend this hotel for your stay."
Jun 2019,40,Hotel Santa Lusta,"In the heart of the flat outdoor restaurant area the area is quite crowded but is close to metro, trollys and of course the elevators to the castle.  The shopping is perfect for easy access and the bakeries abound for the flaky custard treats.  Hotel was pleasant like most in LisboL  Loved every minute."
Jun 2019,50,Great Location in Lisbon,"My husband and I traveled to Portugal for vacation and stayed at Hotel Santa Justa while in Lisbon. The hotel staff emailed us ahead of our stay to make sure we knew how to get to the hotel and asked if there was anything they could do ahead of our arrival, which was a really nice touch. The hotel seems brand new. Decor and rooms are really nice. We had a great view of town from our balcony. The staff was fantastic. Anything we needed - tips for how to get around, where to eat, help with our luggage, etc. they were there to help. Part of why we would go back to the hotel is due to how wonderful the staff was. The location is great. The front is on a no-car street, but close enough to a main road where you don't have to drag your luggage too far. There were a lot of restaurant and shopping options near by. We were also close to an underground stop, so it was easy to get anywhere we needed to go either by walking or by underground. Uber/taxi was also easy from the hotel. We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you, Hotel Santa Justa!"
Jun 2019,50,"Santa Justa Hotel , Perfect position in centre Lisbon","Lovely Hotel, in a perfect location , centre of Lisbon , near to shops, restaurants,  well placed for site seeing .Breakfast very good ,  lots of choice, Staff very helpful with directions and any request we made . Free map given upon arrival along with a mini bottle of port and the local custard tarts in your room on first night ,  mini bar topped daily with fresh water, juice and beer , also free.  mini bottle of sparkling wine on also  last night left in our room with chocolates ,  these are lovely little touches .  Bathrobes and good quality toiletries supplied Yes I would stay again .."
Jun 2019,50,really nice hotel,"nice hotel, well-located, staff really sweet and helpful--on our last night, they left a bottle of wine and chocolates as well as a hand-written note thanking us for staying there.  Restaurant excellent, but no real lobby to sit or wait in."
Jun 2019,50,A Beautiful Hotel in a Great Location,"My wife and I stayed here from Saturday May 25th through June 1, 2019. We arrived at the hotel at about 1300 hours and were unable to check in. The hotel tagged our bags and held them so we could go out. We returned at 1445 hours and the room was ready. We were upgraded to suite. The room was spacious, had ample closet space and a small dresser built into the closets. The room has a safe. The bed was firm but comfortable. The bathroom was the real treat. With a huge walk in shower for two. The bathroom has a solid wood sliding door that does NOT lock. The air conditioning is controlled in the room BUT requires a key card so you cannot leave it on during the hot days. The windows were excellent for soundproofing and we were on the walkway/pedestrian side. The curtains are room darkening. The outlets were both European and UK. The TV was a flat panel with a volume limiter which made it difficult to hear anything at all. There were 3 maybe 4 english channels, Netflix and Amazon. Robes, slippers, and toiletries are included. The internet was great for my android phone but a pain in the ass with our apple devices. Housekeeping was very good. There is free water, beer, juice and coke in a small mini fridge. Twice we sat at the outdoor seating area which is on the pedestrian street. The first time we were constantly bothered by ""sellers"" of necklaces, baubels, and glasses. The second time was not so bad but there are so many people even at 2300 hours it makes the outdoor experience difficult. We did not take the breakfast option with our room, there is plenty of places to snack within a block away. The main reason we chose this hotel was the location, and it did not disappoint. You can walk, tram, metro, or bus it to anywhere. It is a lovely place to sleep, but you will not spend time here. If we return to Lisbon this hotel is a very safe choice but I would look in the Alfama or Chiado area instead."
Jun 2019,50,Unforgettable accommodation,"Fantastic hotel by all means; location is perfect, breakfast is fabulous, free minibar, hotel restaurant offers excellent tasty food at reasonable price, the hotel made our accommodation in Lisbon unforgettable"
May 2019,50,Best location in Lisbon,"If you're going to be spending a few days in Lisbon and need a very central place to stay - this is it!  The people are wonderful.  The restaurants on the block are excellent.  And, you can walk to everything.  Just be aware that the hotel is located in the middle of a pedestrian block, so you'll have to be dropped off and walk an easy 1/2 block to the hotel.  The staff was so helpful and friendly in helping us with directions, dinner suggestions, etc. The rooms were very nice too."
May 2019,50,Great hotel,The hotel is in a great location and near the Santa Justa Lift/elevator so when heading back to the hotel this landmark made it easy to find or to ask directions for. The staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good and the free minibar was an added surprise. Very nice stay and would highly recommend.
May 2019,50,Loved the free minibar,"The minibar was refilled every day for free!  The room was nice, and the breakfasts were good.  The service was good, and the room was very quiet.  The hotel is in a very touristy area, but it feels safe."
May 2019,50,Outstanding property!,Hospitality the way it should be. Employees were kind and helpful. Accommodations were great. Loved the welcome Port and pastries and the no pay stocked mini fridge. Outstanding breakfast that even included champagne!
May 2019,50,A Wonderful Find,"This is a great hotel.  It is clean, right in the center of things and the people are very, very friendly and helpful.  And to top it all off, they bring you a ""gift"" of a small bottle of port and custard tarts (chocolates and Champagne are the other alternatives) each day.  It is surrounded by restaurants, a couple of blocks from the elevator and about a 5 minute walk to the train station.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this to anyone traveling in or around Lisbon."
May 2019,50,Amazing hotel in the centre of Lisbon ! ,"I took my mom to Lisbon for a short break and we stayed at Hotel Santa Justa at the beginning of May for 3 nights. The location is perfect! It is in the center of the city and on a walking distance to all landmarks. We stayed in room 416 which is in the newly refurbished building. It is facing the street and had a little balcony. The room was clean, well furnished, the bed and pillows were very comfy and the marble bathroom was wow ! To welcome us to the hotel, they had left a bottle of port wine with pasteis da nata and the day before we checked out we had chocolates and a bottle of cava. Both times the management of the hotel had left us personalised notes which was a really nice touch. The service at reception was great. I strongly recommend this hotel for your stay in Lisbon !"
Apr 2019,50,Great luxury hotel,"Free minibar drinks, great location, free pastries and a coffee machine. This room exceeded our expectations. Don't hesitate to order. You won't regret it.We didn't take breakfast but I'm sure it's great."
Apr 2019,50,I am a tough rater ,"Excellent - I have travelled to many countries and many many hotels. This is unquestionably top shelf.Our room had a balcony overlooking the street vending area. We had a nice view of the elevator.Room was fine, free mini bar a very nice touch, quiet at night - location perfect.I utilized the staff a couple of times a day since I was not good at finding the locations I was to meet others. Always attentive and in-fact twice went the extra mile (brought up google maps on their computer that showed the exact spot that I was to go to). Customer service is dying around the world but not at Santa Justa.A very pleasant stay!!!"
Apr 2019,50,Great hotel in fantastic location,The hotel is well located in the heart of Lisbon with the rooms overlooking a quiet street. The staff were excellent and provided well good advice. The rooms were beautiful and free minibar was a nice touch. Great restaurants around and good base for visiting Lisbon.
Apr 2019,30,Central location,"We stayed in Santa Justa for four nights in the beginning of April. It’s a good hotel with central location, close to everything, good big rooms with excellent soundproof, minibar included in room charges ( basic soft, water and bear), sufficient breakfast- actually everything was ok, just.... lack of character? coziness? No face, nothing to remember-basic city hotel. The area around is busy with restaurants and bars so can not comment on their food. On site restaurant in opposite building looked terrible- crowded and smelly, we got a table and supposed to sit almost on the knees of the next table clients.. just left without ordering. More quiet in the main building- but when we wanted to watch their Fado show on Sunday evening- they said they are fully booked and did not let us in despite we were hotel guests.... Just a small details but altogether- I would choose different place next time for this price."
Apr 2019,40,Perfect location,"Central location for all the sights. Right next to the Santa Justa elevator. Excellent sound proofing in the room mean you don’t hear any outside noise. Complimentary mini bar a plus, room was a good standard, clean and comfortable. Staff very helpful and friendly. Would stay here on my next trip to this amazing city."
Apr 2019,50,City break,Decided on a City break holiday to Lisbon & my sister in law found this excellent hotel in the centre of Lisbon. Very clean & tidy Hotel with the added bonus of a free mini fridge in the room. The staff were very helpful & friendly suggesting a few sights to see whilst we were there. Booked as bed & breakfast which had plenty of choice but also had an evening meal whilst we were there & found it very tasty. Would stay there again if we went back
Apr 2019,40,Wonderful hotel - great location!,My son and I stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa for several days in late March. The staff were incredibly helpful with all of our questions - it being our first time in Portugal! The room was very comfortable and very clean! The location of the hotel is right near the Elevator Santa Justa -- in the middle of everything. Even though we were in the middle of things -- the room was quiet at night and we slept very well. We were met our first night with a small bottle of port and two pastiche de nata. We would absolutely stay here again!
Apr 2019,50,Fantastic Stay,"Best location, very clean, friendly and helpful staff, quiet.  Do not hesitate to stay here.  Easy access to everything - Metro (Rossio stop from Aeroporto), train station, Tram 15E (tourist tram), waterfront, shopping, restaurants, etc.  On a pedestrian street, so no noisy cars/scooters at night.  Excellent restaurant directly across (Pinoquios).  Avoid the restaurants trying to lure you in.  (Didn't try the hotel's restaurant, so no opinion.)  Only fault was the bed was little too firm for us.  Overall, excellent stay!"
Apr 2019,50,I loved this hotel,"Hotel Santa Justa is an excellent choice to stay in Lisbon. The location is great, with an easy access from airport via Aerobus (only 4 euro) which stops at Praca da Figueira only a short walk (minutes) to the hotel. At the same plaza you can also catch trolley 15E. Also nearby is Rossio metro station. Nice area with old city charm, pedestrian streets with many restaurants and shops, nearby is elevador de Santa Justa, an easy walk to Praca do Comercio, even to the Castelo de S. Jorge up on the hill – there are two convenient elevators to get you up there. Hotel is in a quiet street with no traffic. Hotel staff was pleasant and helpful. I had a double superior room in the newer building across the street, on 5th floor. The room was much smaller than is shown on the hotel website, and due to its very low and angled attic ceiling about half of the room was not accessible and there was no way to avoid bumping your head multiple times. But despite being small and difficult to navigate through, the room was a charming corner unit with two balconies providing a nice view. The room design was clever and modern, and I loved the look of the beautiful exposed wood beams. The bed was comfy, the bathroom was small but with absolutely the best shower I’ve ever had in any hotel. The house keeping was great, the maid was super nice and made sure the room was always tidy and clean. The breakfast at the hotel was very good and twice I had dinner in hotel’s restaurant, it had good food and on those two evenings it was great atmosphere with local musicians playing. The free mini bar in the room, the welcome complimentary port wine and pastry, the farewell thank-you gift of champagne and chocolate were all wonderful personal touches that made me feel genuinely appreciated as their guest. For my next trip to Lisbon I will definitely look to stay again at this hotel."
Apr 2019,50,What a wonderful gem of a hotel,"Stayed recently for birthday treat for my partner, it was just for a few day so we had a lot to pack in. The staff were so helpful long beforehand advising me on restaurants and beaches to visit, and arranged a lovely birthday morning treat. The room had great high ceilings and was spacious with a lovely view to the street. It’s right in the a bustling downtown centre, a close walk to river and lots of places of interest and sightseeing.It’s the detail that took this hotel over the top. Complimentary mini bar, soft drinks, beers and water, the lovely treat the day before we left of Port and Pastel de nata delivered to our door. The staff; from the cleaners to the reception and waiters all cheerful and professional and so helpful (a special mention to Vera who dealt with us a lot!) I found this place on a hotel site but ended up getting a better deal booking directly, so would also recommend that.We were only a few days in Lisbon and I feel I need more time to really experience it and explore. Will look to book with these guys again on my next Lisbon adventure  and see if they have any other hotels elsewhere."
Apr 2019,50,great hotel and excellent service,"location of hotel is very good, in the middle of everything. wine and egg tarts waiting for us in our room right after we checked in was a very nice touch. loved the complimentary drinks in the fridge. 12 euro per person breakfast was reasonably priced and food was good. Front desk staff were all friendly and helpful. will definitely stay here again."
Mar 2019,50,"Convenience, service and style","An excellent location down in the old part of town, with easy reach to restaurants, attractions and the hop-on hop-off buses. Decent sized comfortable rooms. Live Fado in the restaurant some nights. But the stand-out was the front desk staff - always helpful with suggestions, bookings and assistance that went above the norm."
Mar 2019,50,Great hotel in the heart of Lisbon,"I had an excellent stay with Hotel Santa Justa Lisbon. Location-wise, it can’t be beat. It’s right in the heart of the Baixa neighborhood, with shops and restaurants within 5 minutes of the hotel. Public transportation is also nearby. Bairro Alto, Chiado, and Alfama are all within an easy 10-20 minute walk as well. I like that the location is very quiet at night and doesn’t have the rowdiness that staying in Bairro Alto would provide (if you like that aspect of your stay). The room was comfortable, bedding clean, and bathroom nicely appointed with all the toiletries you could want. Ours faced the pedestrian street and there was no noise coming from the outside during the day. Breakfast was excellent and provides a lot of options from eggs, bacon, European breakfast, pastries, and a variety of juices and coffee drinks. What really won me over was the exceptional service from the hotel. From the start, the staff was very helpful and went above and beyond to make your stay comfortable. Our bags were already in our room when our room was ready. The staff helped set up airport transfers, restaurant reservations, and even took care of a bathroom issue quickly. The little details were also very apparent and appreciated - from daily water bottles, free mini bar, chocolates, port, and a parting gift of sparkling wine. Overall, I would recommend this hotel highly for a visit to Lisbon."
Mar 2019,40,Great Location but Noisy Street,"We spent 4 days in Lisbon at the beginning of our trip to Portugal.  The Santa Justa is in a great location, central to everything.  We had booked a Double Comfort Room but were upgraded.  The hotel is in two buildings which face one another across a busy pedestrian street.  Our room was in the new building which was completed about 6 months ago.  Decor is modern.  The room was very large and included a sitting area with a small couch and chair.  Bathroom was spacious with plenty of counter space.  Bed was comfortable - I have a bad back and I had the best sleeps of our 2-week trip in this bed.  There is a Juliet balcony that overlooks the street below.  Breakfast is very good with plenty of gluten-free options for me.  My only issue is that the pedestrian street that separates the halves of the hotel is lined with restaurants.  I am sensitive to noise and was often disturbed by loud voices and singing from passersby and diners."
Mar 2019,50,Excellent location ,"Arrived early not a problem,  bags were kept safe and placed in room when ready.Perfectly placed in centre of everything,  spotlessly clean, rooms got everything you need, kettle and iron and topped up daily with toiletries and mini bar (complimentary)Staff are all pleasant and helpful with good local knowledge. Good choice at breakfast.Would highly recommend this hotelThank youMy favourite days out we're hopping on off trams and catching train and visiting Sintra, a must."
Mar 2019,50,Attention to detail is terrific ,We arrived before our room was ready. No problem. Bags we taken from us and we checked in. We were given a map and we had a lengthy discussion about the city. The location of this hotel is amazing right in the middle of everything. We we got back to a lovely clean room we were welcomed with a bottle of port and on our second day a bottle of champagne and chocolates were left. view from the balcony was amazing and great to watch the huddle and bustle out on the street. Close the double glazed doors and the room is instantly quiet. Nice touches and we did feel really special. Breakfast is a large selection of hot and cold.
Mar 2019,30,Santa Justa Hotel - at the heart of the tourist area,"Located in the heart of the tourist sector of Lisbon parallel to the main tourist ‘drag-way’. You know the sort of thing I mean, an area full of restaurants with laminated menus and a waiter standing outside trying to persuade you to eat in his establishment, when you are going out for the evening.So, if you are happy with staying in this sort of area, then fine. Personally, it’s not my ‘cup of tea’.The SJ hotel itself is functional, clean, attentive and the rooms were spacious with a good bathroom lay-out.So what was missing? Charm is the first thing that springs to mind. No central point in which to congregate such as a convivial bar, in which you could meet and talk to fellow travellers. No character in the rooms such as art, interesting furniture, decor.Breakfast. In a hot smallish area with a poor design and a frenetic feel. Not at all relaxing. The variety of food was good enough, but the cooked elements such as the beans and bacon were cold and congealed. The scrambled egg was one big lump and the fried eggs were cold and hard. Sub-standard coffee machine which kept going wrong. A range of sweet pastries, but the lovely little custard tart things were all gone when we breakfasted, and not replaced. Shame.So, yes, I could have asked them to reheat and or replace everything, but when you are on a short break, and it’s a prestigious hotel, you sort of expect not to have to. You want to come down and have it there for you....So who’s fault is this? Mine. I booked the wrong place. You might love this hotel in a prestigious location with attentive and subservient staff, clean and spacious rooms. For me it wasn’t my favourite place..."
Mar 2019,40,"Lovely hotel, great location","This was a surprise break as a 70th birthday present! The staff were very helpful, we had a room upgrade, so we were up in the attic with views over the city! The bedroom and bathroom were tastefully decorated, The breakfasts were tasty with plenty of choice, including presecco! The hotel is centrally situated, close to the Santa Justa Elivator, main transport links and river front."
Feb 2019,50,Centrally positioned hotel,"The Hotel Santa Justa is in the centre of Lisbon, not far from many of the attractions.     It is an excellent hotel with excellent staff, all of which are very helpful in making your stay a good one.     The room 505 which can be accessed either buy lift or stairs is a good one, being more of a suite, with very large bed, good size bathroom and comfortable settee and chairs. The room has a large television too.     The restaurant has an excellent choice of both hot and cold buffet for breakfast.  Dinner is available too.     Again, the staff are friendly and efficient and the hotel is in a superb position."
Feb 2019,50,Must be a castle as we were treated like Queens!!,"We stayed for two nights on a quick visit to Lisbon. Our two rooms were upgraded and then we were welcomed with a pastry and port on the first night. Recommendations and reservations made for restaurants by Jon at the front desk were excellent and no trouble. Dinner included live wonderful fado music. Watched while Artur our waiter managed a difficult unreasonable customer with grace and patience, then arrived at our table unruffled and attentive. Great location, great customer service, would return here in a heartbeat should the opportunity arrive."
Feb 2019,50,lovely hotel in a great location,"it was my brothers birthday at the hotel and the staff/manager made it a really nice birthday with champagne, sparkling wine and chocolates. there is also a mini bar free with beer and soft drinks/water. we had a lovely junior suite with balconies. i cant thank the staff enough for all they did. we would thoroughly recommend the hotel. plenty of breakfast choice too. nice restaurant and good service. THANK YOU"
Feb 2019,50,central and helpful,"We were upgraded from inside to outside rooms, and the staff were friendly and very helpful. The hotel is central - very near the airport bus stop, the Santa Justa lift, the 28 tourist tram and a metro station. Check out time is not until12 - very useful!"
Feb 2019,50,"Perfect location, comfortable place","The location couldn’t be better for exploring Lisbon. The check-in was easy, the communication in English trouble-free. The rooms are very clean with comfortable beds and a nice bathroom. The complimentary Pasteles de nata and port wine were a very sweet touch and of good quality as well. The breakfast choice is good with a variety of hot and cold foods, the highlight in our view the freshly squeezed orange juice in abundance. The sweet pastries were very nice as well. We totally recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here when we visit Lisbon again."
Feb 2019,50,Excellent !,"Hotel Santa JustaExcellent hotel. It started with a friendly checkin. They upgraded us because they were not full which was very kind. Staff are friendly, caring, and helpful, and will give you visitor information if you ask. Thank-you especially to Tania and Diogo. You both made our enjoyable stay even more enjoyable.  Obrigado ! Our room had a comfortable bed (king as 2 twins together), 2 small chairs, small table, desk, amble space (European standards), good lighting, large bathroom with a rainfall shower, room safe, flat screen TV and a bathroom scale. A fridge with juice, water, beer and coke is complimentary. We stayed for 5 nights and ate all nights in the hotel's restaurant which has excellent food and great, professional service. There was live music 2 of these nights, which we enjoyed. Breakfast has an excellent variety of hot and cold items, including fresh fruit & pastries. It also included sparkling wine. This breakfast in comparison to hotels around the world is a 10/10. A UK, Canadian, & double round pin plug is located near the desk and in the bathroom. This hotel is on a pedestrian street so it is extremely quiet. The immediate neighbourhood is clean and appears safe and we felt secure within the hotel. We had neighbours on either side of us but no sound is coming through the walls. We got the taxi to drop us off at the corner of Rua da Prata &  Rua de Santa Justa so it was only 50 M up Santa Justa towards the elevator as the hotel is on the corner of Santa Justa & Rua dos Correerios. We picked this hotel because of it's excellent location to the Rossio train station, first stop of the tram 15 and a 5 minute walk to the tram 28's first stop. The room was clean to start and they did a great job each day. If we come back to Lisbon WE WOULD stay here again !!!!Thank-you for making our stay in Lisbon enjoyable."
Feb 2019,50,Great hotel,"This hotel is fantastic from the minute you walk in the door. The concierge was welcoming went out of his way to advise us on local restaurants, bakeries, places to visit and local attractions.  We returned in the evening and found a complimentary bottle of wine and pasta denatas in our room.  Dinner in the hotel restaurant was on of the best meals I've ever had and the service was wonderful.  As we had an early morning flight, too early for the complimentary breakfast a packed meal was waiting for us when we cheked out.  5 stars isn't enough for this hotel."
Jan 2019,50,Location!,Excellent hotel..we spent 4 nights and were very pleased with the service. They go out of they're way...traditional tart and port upon arrival..clean rooms..good breakfast with everything and more..even champagne and fresh OJ...had dinner in the dining room couple of nights and enjoyed everything..front desk helpful and efficient. Will definitely be back..Thank you so much..good value..we walked everywhere. And convenient for All transportation.
Jan 2019,50,Great hotel!!!,"I loved this hotel, nice, clean and big rooms, service was espectacular and the location couldn't be any better.I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Lisbon.Breakfast was amazing too, taxi station is only a few steps away. Walkable distance to anywhere in Lisbon"
Jan 2019,50,"Perfect accommodation, highly recomend!","xcellent in all aspects: location, comfort, cleanliness, service; spacious and comfortable room and bathroom, perfect heating and air conditioning, varied breakfast, free minibar, welcome kit, thank you kit and amenities with high quality products."
Jan 2019,40,"Great location, beware of your room choice!","Pros: Location, staff, food, cleanlinessCons: Room (family room in the additional building), bad smell (some nights) from the toiletThe hotel has a great location; very close to the historical Elevator, Praça da Figueira (square where the trams and the city tour buses depart), Rue de Santa Justa (for shops, restaurants-cafes) and Chiado (great place for shopping). The staff is very polite and always helpful. They are very good at thinking small but very nice ways of pleasing you (like sending wine to the room for welcoming and toiletries for the kids).The breakfast is very good. You can also listen to Fado on certain nights at the hotel restaurant. This is a good option for families traveling with their kids under 10 (like us) since the kids under 10 are not allowed in many of the Fado shows in the city. The dinner menu is also good.My critique is the room. We made the reservation via Expedia. We chose the family room that was shown on the site. During the check in, we learned that our room was not in the main building but in the newly furbished one. Yes, the room is newly furbished but although the room is not small, it is not useful for a family with 2 kids. You can barely walk in the room when the second bed is open (which is open all the time). You use a key card for the entrance, there is no reception or control in the entrance of the additional building which makes you feel a little bit of unsafe. A bad smell was coming from the toilet during night time (not all nights) and the last day the toilet was blocked. When we talked with the reception they said the reason was the tides and the city's old infrastructure. Last note about the toilet: I think they wanted it to be more accessible for everybody but it was very difficult to use the toilet for us because of its incredibly low height.The overall quality of our stay was good. I believe the rooms in the main building are better. It's a great choice because of its great location but discuss about the room with the hotel beforehand."
Jan 2019,50,Nice stay at Santa Justa,"Very nice hotel in the centre of Lisbon on a pedestrianised street. Very friendly welcome and ongoing support from the hotel staff. Room was really clean and came with the courtesy mini bar (mainly soft drinks). We stayed on 4th in room with a very small balcony, which provided good views of the street below. Good sound proofing when balcony door was closed. Lots of restaurant and shops nearby"
Jan 2019,50,Great hotel in the centre of Lisbon,"This is a great hotel! The location is fantastic, just a few minutes from Rossio square. There are excellent transport connections nearby and many sights are within walking distance. There are loads of restaurants and cafes to choose from nearby as well!The room itself is lovely and modern. A small bottle of port and pastel de nata were in our room on arrival which was a nice touch! The room had a widescreen tv, proper hairdryer, nice toiletries, a Nespresso machine, kettle, fridge and a safe.Breakfast in the hotel was nice - Plenty of choice and it set us up nicely for the day. The staff were all very helpful and friendly.This is a lovely hotel but the location is the real winner!"
Jan 2019,50,Friendly and very comfortable hotel - great location too,"What an excellent hotel, very centrally located in Lisbon.  They are very friendly, rooms are comfortable and clean. Restaurant is very nice and good value for money.  I was primarily there for business but my sister also accompanied me so it was a mix of business and family travel.  I stayed in two different rooms - a single room by myself, then a deluxe twin room when my family member joined. In the smaller room, shower was easy to get in and out of.  In the second room, it was a very difficult climb into a jacuzzi style bath - easy to slip and possibly dangerous for anyone older or disabled.  For anyone not fully mobile suggest checking to make sure bath tub/shower is manageable.  Other than this small point, we loved the hotel and could not have been happier."
Jan 2019,50,Greet place & employees,"The hotel was in great location , it was near everything The reception employees were friendly and helpfulGood furnitures & clean Good bathroom Quite hotel all the timeThe breakfast was goodThe Sealing in the fifth floor was anoin"
Jan 2019,40,Good value for money,"Excellent location, utmost friendly staff with good advises on restaurants etc. Lobby Restaurant is set too narrowly, too open to reception and street, therefore lacking a Cody athmosphere. Rooms very clean, big bed and shower, rest a little small, not recommendable for more than one suitcase."
Jan 2019,50,Excellent - I would stay there again ,"Wonderful staff, clean spacious room with lots of storage- bonus treat and small bottle of port provided as a welcome to me. Good location, they arranged transport back to the airport that was efficient and less expensive.  Breakfast is limited in choice compared with other locations I have stayed at but had sufficient choices.  One tip use the metro or Uber not taxis if travelling around Lisbon."
Jan 2019,50,Wonderful hotel!!!,"Hotel Santa Justa was an absolutely awesome place to spend a week in Lisbon. Centrally located we walked to Castelo de Sao Jorge, Alfama, Praca do Comércio, the Time-out Market and the hop on hop off buses are a few minutes away. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The junior suites were comfortable and roomy. The mini bar is free and we did pay extra for the breakfast buffet. I would highly recommend staying here!"
Jan 2019,40,"Convenient to all the sites, great staff, comfortable room","I was impressed that immediately after confirming my reservation I received a welcome letter from the hotel giving me helpful information. I was equally impressed when I emailed them with a question to receive an answer very soon after sending it. The hotel information allowed me to get there via the metro, which was convenient. They are located on a pedestrian street with numerous restaurants and shops nearby. During my stay the staff were friendly and helpful."
Jan 2019,50,Great location in the heart of Lisbon,"The hotel is on a pedestrian street, but that was not a problem when arriving by car. The hotel staff met us at the entrance on an underground parking close by.We got a room on the top floor across the street from the front desk. This new annex to the hotel is  elegant and well appointed with comfortable furniture and modern bathrooms. Being on the top floor means the ceiling is low in parts of the room, not recommendable for tall people.Very helpful staff, good breakfast and everything at walking distance."
Dec 2018,50,Christmas in Lisbon,"Awesome Hotel with exceptional service and location,.Staff always goes above and beyond, rooms are great, location is perfect.Very clean, beautifully decorated, quant, classy, great restaurant, and beautiful Lisbon at your door step"
Dec 2018,50,Excelent stay!!,"Highly recommended. The hotel is much nicer than what we were expecting and the staff was extremely friendly. Great Location and you wont get a better bang for your buck than this property.One night we were looking for fado in Lisboa and couldn't find any bars that played it live. Funny enough we return to the hotel and they had a group of Fado playing live at the hotel bar. Excelente, thanks for the great stay."
Dec 2018,50,A wonderful vacation,"The hotel's location is excellent, close to attractions and public transport.The room is comfortable, spacious, clean and quiet. The staff is courteous and ready to help with any request and question.warmly recommended. I'm sure I'll be back."
Dec 2018,50,Good Stay,"Great room, friendly staff, good location, free minibar, nespresso machine. Great time. We will come back and recomend to everybody. I do not need 200 characters to say that this is a very good hotel."
Dec 2018,30,Good location and value for money,"It didn’t start well. The car pick up I arranged from the hotel claimed they were on site. The lady picking me up had my name handwritten on a white sheet of paper, so she can easily stood out as one of the only two or three women, who happens to be colored (without sounding non-discriminatory), and didn’t dress well. She called the driver to pick me up. The wait? Almost 20 minutes. I informed the receptionist of my experience with this car company so that they are aware of the services it provides since it is tried up with them. The hotel location is central. However, because of this, cars are not allowed to pass in front of the hotel. The reception area, even the hallway appears to be cramped but clean. Upon entering the room, I was surprised that it is quite big for European standards. The balcony opens (I attached a few photos I took from the balcony) to a good view of the street. The restaurant serves decent breakfast. The dinner is good too and well priced. The food servers are very friendly and warm especially the lady who is pregnant (I’m sorry, I forgot her name). I wish they have more dessert wines available because they don’t. There is a minibar inside the room and I believe that it’s free too. I stayed here for 5 days so I had to go to a grocery store nearby to some snacks. I took a couple of private tour guides which are not from their referral because of the bad experience for the hotel pick up, so I am unsure as to how they screen them.Overall, my experience is what you expect for the price you paid for. It’s not a 5-star hotel but cheap for its location. I can’t give it a 4-star rating because there’s nothing stellar. It’s an average stay I would say. Would I stay again? Probably but I will need to find alternate accommodations first."
Dec 2018,50,Excellent 1 night stay,Got a excellent rate via booking.com for 1 night stay prior to our flight home. Hotel is in excellent location and few blocks from Rossio metro station. Our room was ready early as we arrived around 1pm. Rooms are very modern and comfortable. Hotel delivered us 2 complimentary mini tarts and mini bottle of Port which was nice touch. We had a drink in the hotels restaurant and they are little too expensive compared to others which surround the hotel.hotel wifi is good. We ate dinner about 100 meters down from the hotel and was excellent. Hotel was quiet and didn't hear any noise in the night.Definitely would consider this hotel again if we ever stay in Lisbon again.
Dec 2018,50,Heart of the tourist district,"The hotel is located right in the heart of the tourist district of Lisbon. You have easy access to several metro lines as well as the fundiculars and elevator. There's a pastry shop at the end of the block. The room was very comfortable and had a nice view of the street which was quiet at night. The other restaurants on the street had the stereotypical guy out front pushing you to eat there, ignore those guys and go see the city. The shower in this hotel was one of the best showers I've experienced in a hotel, possibly ever."
Dec 2018,50,Excellent hotel + Fantastic Staff + Great Location,"Booked this hotel for my wifes birthday and im so glad we did. The staff were exceptional from service to appearance to application which is a credit to your hotel.Our room was cosy and nice pillows. The personal touch of the wine and natas was a nice extra and appreciated. :)  All in all a faboulous experience and we cannot recommend this hotel highly enough - Airport ride to hotel is around 10 - 15 euros by taxi and hotel is well situated in the middle and close to Rossio metro which and local restaurants, Just be weary of the local restaurants people trying to try their restaurants on the street of the where the hotel is situated - more restaurants around walking distance so check around :) thank you again hotel Justa will definitely come again next time we are in lisbon.:)  Kin"
Dec 2018,40,Made our Stay Great!,"Great Room with a lot of space , Nice bed and pillows, Clean and spacious bathroom.Welcome bottle of wine and sweets, Polite stuff at the Reception, Quick check in and check out process. Central location in a short walking distance from the seafront. All restaurants and shops within 10 meters walking distance. Fantastic!"
Dec 2018,50,Thank you ,"Dear Mariana and Paula,Your hotel has been a daily delight and has exceeded our expectation regarding the quality of your staff. They promptly respond to emails 24/7 and always offer kindness and friendly support. The breakfast was brilliant, the location exceptional, but your staff and the culture of hospitality are the best. Our room was spacious modern , clean  and very well equipped for my special needs.We want to offer you a special thank you. After days of travel and a long day of tourism we choose to dine with you tonight. This  was mainly for our comfort. My wife and I were delighted to learn there was a FADO performance as well.Eddie, Eduardo, and Hugo were not performers, they were ambassadors of your country and culture. A quiet evening became a joyful, sorrow with music and the longing nostalgia that is Fado. These generous wonderful people reflect the kindness and friendship we have seen and experienced here in Lisbon. I was proud to meet these strangers who left us all happy and parted from us with the embrace of old friends.They are a group you should encourage and grow into a regular program for your hotel.Thank you for a wonderful evening.AbbrigadoMarvin CraneSent from my iPhone"
Dec 2018,50,Business and pleasure in Lisbon.,From the staff to room and proximity to old town neighborhoods you can't go wrong here. The local restaurants can be annoying trying to get you to eat at thier places very in your face and honestly they do well with the Cruise boats but if you are there for a few days stay away from eating there and take a walk into the neighborhood. If you arrive after 10 am you must walk in from one of the squares nearby but not a long walk. The free mini bar is a great addition to the stay.
Dec 2018,50,Excellent Hotel and Staff,"Our first visit to Lisbon and we choosed the right Hotel. It was all over a perfect stay.From the arrival everything went smooth and the room  (double superior room) was perfect. Lot of space and the quietness was as described when we booked. Room cleaning was also excellent. The breakfast buffet was very good, you could find what ever You wanted and was a perfect start of the day."
Dec 2018,50,"Great Location, friendly staffs","Central location easy to get around Lisbon.  Good breakfast and very friendly staff, rooms are clean and in good size with free minibar.  Located just one block behind the main shopping area, a lot of choices of restaurant.  Will recommend to people going to Lisbon."
Nov 2018,50,"Excellent hotel, location, staff and restaurant","Stayed 5 nights. Location is as central as it gets. Rooms recently refurbished, clean well serviced with all you need. Coffee, free minibar for soft drinks and beer, aircon. 3 minutes to Rossio square on foot for trains and metro. Tram stops closer. Staff are fantastic very professional but welcoming. Restaurant excellent. Made to feel very welcome. Wouldn't stay anywhere else now. Breakfast; good choice of hot and cold with brilliant coffee and selection of juices, pastries etc. Stayed many places worldwide. Very few offer the personal touch in a city setting."
Nov 2018,40,Great location,"We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Santa Justa.  The room is pretty good - kettle, safe, ironing board, large bathroom etc.  They give you little extras - wine, chocolates and tarts (natas).  The rooms could benefit from more storage space for clothes - there aren’t really any drawers so you can’t really unpack.  The shower is big (and has a window with retractable blinds). The front desk is really good and the restaurant is average.  The entertainment in the restaurant was poor.  Overall great location and I would stay here again!"
Nov 2018,50,Great hotel in a prime location !,It was my first visit to Lisbon and the Santa Justa hotel was highly recommended to us. The hotel has more than lived up to its expectations. We were upgraded on arrival to a suite with a balcony and everyone at the hotel has been extremely attentive and nothing has been too much trouble ! Look no further if you are planning a visit to Lisbon stay at the hotel Santa Justa !
Nov 2018,40,Location Location Location,"When I learned I would again attend the massive Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, I immediately re-booked the Hotel Santa Justa. This time, I was traveling alone, as my wife felt that Lisbon three years running may be a bit overkill.  The rooms are relatively spacious and immaculate. The bathroom had a great shower and it too was pristine. The wifi was decent, but this time, not perfect. For some reason (GDPR?), I couldn't access my Twitter account on the hotel's free wifi.  Most importantly Hotel Santa Justa is a 2-minute walk to the metro and within 15 minutes walking to the city's main shopping area and dining areas.  The front desk was exceptionally friendly, and their English impeccable (since my Portuguese is non-existent).  I was treated to a free mini-bottle of Port wine, some chocolates, and a personalized welcome note.  Other than the hawkers on the street trying to cajole you to an outdoor table for a meal, being ""downtown"" in Lisbon -- and at the Hotel Justa -- make visiting there so easy."
Nov 2018,50,Wonderful hotel and great location,"The room was spacious with a balcony overlooking the street. The bathroom was stocked so well with toiletries that they encouraged us to take samples home. The location is great for Rossio, Chiado/barrio alto, and allfama. We were delighted with our 2 night stay."
Nov 2018,50,Lisbon,Great boutique hotel. Wonderful service. Lots of little treats in room each day. Would stay here again. It is I great location. We were able to walk almost everywhere. The staff was very accommodating.
Nov 2018,50,Perfect Location,"Hotel Santa Justa is perfectly located near museums, trains and buses and within walking distance to restaurants and shopping.  Front desk staff was helpful in suggesting and securing dinner reservations. Rooms are modern with amenities and quiet.  Can't wait to go back to Lisbon."
Nov 2018,40,Very good hotel in a super location!,"The Hotel Santa Justa is located in mid-Lisbon just around the corner from the Rossio Station and Square. It is only several blocks from the Santa Justa Elevator (a coincidence of the name???). They recently renovated and upgraded a small block of rooms in an older building across the pedestrian-only street from the main building and that is where we stayed. The security is excellent - key card access to open the lobby doors 24 hours a day and then key card to operate the elevator.The front desk and service personnel were delightful and offered to arrange for taxis, etc. almost before we had to ask.We would definitely stay there again."
Nov 2018,40,Ticks the right boxes,"Stayed here during a mini break to Lisbon. Great, central location near Rossio Square, so easy to access all the sights plus metro and train to Sintra.Staff very helpful and friendly.Good breakfast selection.Rooms are ok, abit small but it’s what you’d expect at the price and location.Complimentary fizz and chocolates were a nice surprise and the free mini bar too (although it’s soft drinks only)."
Nov 2018,50,Great Place to Stay,"HSJ is a nicely priced, yet modern hotel, with great service.  The rooms are large enough (compared to where we live in NYC), nicely appointed, and the staff is very helpful.  The location is perfect- just a block from a transport hub or walking to many of the tourists sites, shopping, and eating.  Safety is not an issue here.  Pedestrian streets are very active in this area, and we were there in the ""slow"" season. We added the breakfast option and were glad we did, as this gave us a good start to our day (complete with mimosas)."
Oct 2018,50,Location and service quality a definite plus,"Stayed here one night after a 10 day tour of Portugal. Chose the place because of it’s great location close to restaurants and the lift to the Chiado area plus the Rossio train station and metro. But this hotel offers more. The service level is exceptional. Mini bar contents were complimentary. Luggage storage was terrific . we could walk around the area until the room was ready. Reception arranged taxi transfers to airport which worked even on a rainy day. Our room was in the new building and the bathrooms were very modern and the rooms had ample plug ins , lighting and windows which shut out any street noise. Will book here again when in Lisbon."
Oct 2018,50,"Great location, wonderful service, comfortable bed",A wonderful location in the heart of the Baixa -- Downtown Lisbon. Easy walking distance to everything. Hotel staff were gracious and helpful. Thank you for a great stay. We will look forward to returning!
Oct 2018,40,A Contemporary Boutique Hotel With Fine Food & Wine,"The Santa Justa is ideally located to be just minutes from the heart of everything, with a very helpful, professional staff. It also has a surprisingly good restaurant that is very reasonably priced for good food and local Portuguese favorites, including fine wines from the region.  The room we had was especially spacious (room 205) but had very little closet space or drawers, so if you’re on a long trip with additional baggage, most of your clothing will have to remain in your suitcase (hopefully your clothing fabric will be one that needs little or no ironing).  The only thing which disappointed us was that the room could have been in any business hotel in any city in the world because there was NOTHING that reflected the character or history of Portugal, or for that matter, Lisbon. We are travelers who like to soak up the culture, and this hotel lacked anything “Portuguese” (except the food and wine). To be so close to the lovely port and historic plazas, and to stay someplace lacking any evidence of the local culture was, for us, very disappointing."
Oct 2018,50,Great hotel in an excellent location,"We stayed here for 6 nights and had a great time.  The hotel is in a very central location in a pedestrianised street, with easy access to the main sites and the transport system.  We asked beforehand for a quiet room and had one on the top floor looking across the rooftops to the Santa Justa elevador.  The room was very quiet and well appointed with an extremely comfortable bed.  Very good buffet breakfast with a good choice of hot and cold food.  All the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Huge choice of restaurants in the streets around the hotel and we had a very good dinner in the hotel restaurant. We were delighted with our choice and would choose the Santa Justa if we returned to Lisbon."
Oct 2018,40,Nice room and in the very city centre,"I was in the new premise (building in front of the old one). Very new and nice room (still a bit of smell from painting). From the top floor there was a cool landscape.Nice hotel and price competitive. However, the breakfast is under average. Very limited offer of cakes."
Oct 2018,50,The PERFECT Location ,"It’s hard to add anything new, because it seems most have similar experiences.  The hotel is perfectly located near public transportation and lots of downtown sites Within walking distance, BUT, it’s wonderfully located on a pedestrian street.  I was so glad to get away from the crowds when we went back to the hotel.  The street was quiet at night.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Breakfast was great.  The room we had was kind of small, but modern and clean.  The bathroom is large.  Port, chocolates and pastries were delicious and a nice touch.  We will be in Lisbon again next year and we’ll definitely stay here again!"
Oct 2018,40,Great location and nice rooms,"Location was great- we were in walking distance to most things we wanted to see, and many restaurants and shopping just a few steps away from the hotel. Rooms were nice, but we had paid extra for the larger room. Other family that we traveled with had just a standard room and it was a bit small- worth the money to upgrade. The breakfast was decent and had good selection of things to eat. Not much in the way of other amenities, but you will get a nice room at a good price. Staff were very nice and very helpful to us, and all spoke English, which we appreciated. Bathrooms were also a good size and had nice shower.  I would definitely recommend this hotel."
Oct 2018,50,Vacation,Staff attentive and accommodating with all requests including airport transportation private tours. property updated and clean and located in city center easy walk to restaurants shopping public transportation
Oct 2018,50,Wonderful hotel in fantastic location,Spent 6 nights at Hotel Santa Justa. The staff is exceptionally helpful and courteous. The location of the hotel literally in the exact center of Lisbon is fantastic. Right outside the front door are at least 10 outdoor restaurants with great food.; 100 yards from a major shopping area.
Oct 2018,50,Post dinner drinks w/ live music,Came across live music from the bar area as we were heading back to our hotel from dinner. Stopped in for a couple of glasses of sparkling wine and dessert. The acoustic music was pretty good. Nice way to end the evening.
Oct 2018,50,Superb location,"Elegant street cafe/restaurant on the cobbled street in the heart of the old town. A welcome change from the tourist restaurants. Offering  special 13 Euro lunch. Choice of main, desert and drink. Excellent quality and value. Thoroughly enjoyed my choice of salmon risotto and tiramisu. Easy to find on the Santa Justa elevator street."
Oct 2018,50,Nice Place to arrive Too!!,"Stayed 2 nights here and enjoyed it very much. Rooms were clean and modern, with nice amenities. Front desk staff very helpful, with both restaurant and local site info. Veryclose to everything, would recommend this to anyone and would stay here once again!!"
Oct 2018,40,Centrally located,The hotel is located right on the main pedestrian malls. The rooms are clean and well appointed. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The minibar is free. The bed was comfortable but the room was a little noisy.
Oct 2018,50,"Awesome location,great staff","I just spent 3 nights at hotel Santa Justa, and I have to say, it was a gem, perfect location,great staff, attention to details better than a 5 star hotel, to me this was a 5 star hotel. It was so nice to come to my room and see a small bottle of wine, chocolate,sweet wine, pasteis De Belem,and awesome music. I will recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking for an awesome hotel. I forgot to mention that everything in the mini bar is free."
Oct 2018,50,Very happy with my stay...,"The hotel is located in a very crowded, touristy area but centrally and close to all main attractions. There was no major outside noise during late evening/night hours and the area around hotel is very clean and pleasant in spite of numerous street restaurants."
Oct 2018,50,Perfect Fit!,"Hotel Santa Justa is absolutely perfect. Ideal location near the Elevador, Great lively staff, wonderful restaurant, real air conditioning that works perfectly, as does the internet, clean, beautiful rooms and a great price point"
Oct 2018,50,Excellent hotel in the center of the action.,"Located just steps from the Santa Justa Lift, the Hotel Santa Justa is the perfect spot for all your Lisbon adventures. The hotel is clean, bed was comfortable, plenty of storage space, and the free minibar was a nice touch. And for the quality of the hotel, the price was very affordable Highly recommend this hotel."
Oct 2018,50,Great Location and Nicely Appointed,My husband I recently stayed at this hotel in Lisbon.  We thought it was comfortable and nicely appointed.  The linens were great.  The bathroom was quite large and the shower was excellent.  I liked the security feature of having to use a room key to get into the annex lobby of the hotel.  One of the best features was the Nespresso coffee maker in the breakfast area.   I would skip having dinner in the restaurant.  The food was average and many of the tables were sitting at an angle making it difficult to balance glassware. The location was excellent and there are many other restaurants in the area.
Sep 2018,40,Very Nice Hotel in Downtown Lisbon,"My Family and I stayed at this hotel for several nights when visiting Lisbon.  I would say our overall stay was very pleasant with only a small hiccup here and there.  The location of the hotel is probably one of the strongest features.  It's located just off of Rossio square, which is very centrally located to all of the sightseeing. The operated as a great base camp for our trip.  The rooms were also very modern and clean.  We also enjoyed the family suite that had adjoining rooms.  Since we were traveling with family it was nice to have that level of connection.  The morning breakfast was good but if you waited towards the end it had a tendency to be picked over so we tried to get there on the earlier side each morning.  The staff was very helpful.  The only issue we had was that the hotel booked us a van transfer that ended up thinking we were going to the airport when in reality we needed to go the Santa Apolonia train station.  The van service ended up charging us the airport rate of 45 euros for a transfer that  probably should have costed half of that.  Beside breakfast being slightly picked over and the van transfer debacle our stay at this hotel was very good.  I would recommend if you are going to Lisbon for the first time and are looking for a centrally located hotel for sight seeing."
Sep 2018,50,Loved this place!,"Loved everything about this place; the room, location, and service! Pedestrian-only street with many shops and restaurants, but it's a very short, flat! walk from where Uber dropped us. Room 102 was large, modern, and tho it overlooks the pedestrian-only street, was quiet (street activity ceases overnight). Staff was cheerful, VERY helpful and attentive to details. Amenities (Lavender pillow spray! Custard tarts!) were icing on the cake! Wish we'd have stayed longer. Maybe next time."
Sep 2018,50,Lisbon,Second time in Lisbon and the second time we stayed at the Santa Justa Hotel.  This is a great place to stay when  visiting Lisbon and its surrounding areas.  The rooms are very clean and the staff friendly and helpful.  I'd definitely suggest this hotel if you are looking for a place to stay while visiting Lisbon..
Sep 2018,40,Charming hotel and staff,"Stayed for 5 nights, and the staff couldn't have been more helpful, especially after the first night with really noisy neighbours!  Breakfast was always busy and at times fresh refills had to be requested, but staff always really willing to oblige.  Ideally situated for all the wonderful sights in Lisbon."
Sep 2018,50,Great experience!,"My husband and I stayed here for five nights and we really enjoyed it! The hotel is in the PERFECT location. It puts you within walking distance to most places and is surrounded by great shopping and restaurants. The staff was extremely sweet and accommodated anything we needed. The hotel itself is very new and the room was way bigger than I expected. The bathroom was actually gorgeous. My only compliant is that, one night, we pressed ""up"" on the elevator in the new building, and it literally just dropped to the basement with a thud. I was scared to death. We ended up stuck in the basement for a while with no doors to the outside - but we took the staff elevator back up. It was a little scary but we all survived lol. We will be back!"
Sep 2018,40,Long weekend in Lisbon,My first visit for pleasure. Hotel was great. Fabulous location in the centre of the city. Staff very friendly and helpful planning visits and arranging airport transfers. Overall a great experience with no hesitation to return.
Sep 2018,50,"Perfect location, Room and service","The front desk at the hotel is so helpful and was able To help us with everything from booking trains to booking tours, even before our arrival! The free mini bar was a wonderful touch and was restocked every day. Our room was so clean and quiet even though it was facing the street.’it was a pleasure to open the windows in the morning and feel the city slowly come to life. Thank you for a wonderful stay !"
Sep 2018,50,"Outstanding service, staff and property!","We recently spent one night here and although it was a short visit, we couldn't have been happier with the level of service, friendliness of staff and the quality of the room and amenities. They had chocolates, a bottle of port, complimentary mini and the traditional Portuguese custard tarts waiting for us in our room upon arrival. We were so tired, that we slept in and missed the cut off for breakfast, which we had paid for. I called down to the front desk, and they sent up a full breakfast via room service, tha was totally over the top, and only charged us 4 euros for the room service tax. Seriously good service, here. The bathroom was gorgeous-all white marble and had we not booked another hotel for the last two nights, we would have stayed there longer. I highly recommend this property- and the location is right in the heart of the city."
Sep 2018,50,Perfect Stay,"We stayed her 3 nights in September. Everything from start to finish was perfect. The reception staff were very friendly and explained about the area and the places of interest and marked them on a map. We were given an upgrade to a superior room which was a lovely surprise and gesture. We were shown to the room by the porter who explained the features of the room. The room was spacious, clean and very well equipped. There is a complimentary mini bar which is stocked every day. The free Wi-fi is good. My wife received a complimentary L’Occitane ladies gift set and we were brought a small bottle of Port and 2 Pastel Da Nata’s that evening..the hotel is in an excellent central location for exploring Lisbon and there is no noise from the street or adjoining rooms. Thoroughly recommend this hotel."
Sep 2018,40,Location is what you pay for,"Stayed here for 4 nights in August.  Best thing about it is it’s location which is right in the center of everything - shops, restos, metro, bus.  Almost everything is within walking or transit distance. Breakfast was great and front desk staff helpful.  Only thing that needs improvement is the housekeeping, who forgot to empty our trash the first day, forgot to get the dirty towels on the 2nd, and forgot to refill the coffee pods on the 3rd.  Otherwise, this hotel was nice."
Sep 2018,30,Good,Location: 5/5 The hotel’s location was amazing! Right in the city center of Lisbon. Service: 4/5 The service was ok. Not bad but not extremely good. The knowledge of English was excellent! Rooms: 4/5 Our rooms were very nice. A lot of space and very nice beds! The shower pressure was amazing! There were chocolates on the bed. The only downside was that there was a smell from the pipe in the bathroom but I guess there is not much you can do about that. Also there was a little piece of glass on the floor and on the curtains there were some spots of blood/ a spilled red drink.  But in general the room was very well equipped and we spend some 2 excellent nights here. Breakfast: 2/5 was ok. Lots of choices but the quality was not amazing. For this price we expected something more. It was just fine. Also the service here were talking to each other and weren’t so attentive to the guests. But of course nothing dramatic. In general we had a great time and would recommend this place!!
Aug 2018,40,Best location one can seek!,"Lisbon is an amazing city. People are warm and friendly. Portugal is cheaper than Spain which we had found cheaper than other Northern European countries. Santa Justa is located in the very heart of the city, all places tourists love are mostly walking distance. The staff is excellent in assisting guests. They give precise and correct information and are ever there to help you. My bag had not arrived from Brussels and I had given our hotel info at the airport. They must’ve contacted or whatever but next day morning one of the hotel staff brought it all smiles to our room.  The room too has every facility and comfort. The what all the mini fridge holds is free for the guests, wine, soft drinks, sodas and water. Espresso coffee too. Spotlessly clean and comfortably sized we are having a great time in Lisbon, a beautiful city staying at Hotel Santa Justa."
Aug 2018,50,Lovely place,I stayed here a few weeks ago on the advice of my travel advisor David Edwards who travels Europe on a regular basis. Fantastic hotel and would recommend to all. Thanks to the staff at the hotel for making my stay a brilliant one and many thanks to David Edwards for all his hard work in searching out and booking this hotel on my behalf. David is a wonderful holiday organiser!
Aug 2018,50,Fantastic Hotel.,"Fantastic Hotel. Staff very helpful and accommodating, room very clean, well stocked and lovely. We had room 512 at the top of the hotel, with duel aspect balconies and fantastic views. Location excellent, very central which made exploring really easy. Breakfast included all you needed to set you up for the day. Complementary mini bar was restocked every day."
Aug 2018,50,"Great location, wonderful staff!","Hotel Santa Justa is in the perfect location to explore Lisbon - 5 minutes to Praça Comércio, 15 minutes to Castelo Sao Jorge, and steps away from the Santa Justa Lift and Chiado...We arrived at 11am and were so happy to have our room ready, we were also upgraded to a superior double. The room was spotless and modern with a beautiful large bathroom and rain shower. We loved breakfast! So many pastries, the freshest fruit, cheeses, ham, eggs, breads and more. It was a great way to begin each day.Special thank you to Nadiya at reception for being to accommodating, sweet and welcoming. And thank you to the thoughtful staff for our chocolates and champagne on our last night. I would definitely stay here again."
Aug 2018,50,Perfect location & Good service,"We stayed at Hotel Santa Justa for one week. The location of the hotel is perfect, adjacent to Praća da Fequeira (one-minute walk). Situated in Baixa, the location makes it an easy access to different places. Moreover, there are tuk tuks (usually €4-€6/person - depending on the destination) and taxis (e.g. from Baixa to Belém is €7.5) everywhere. It is only two minutes away from the Santa Justa Lift to Chiado. The staff of the hotel were very polite and friendly. The breakfast buffet at the lobby restaurant was good (€15 per person), with several seasonal fruits and variety of Portuguese pastries. We stayed on the first floor, one regular room for two persons and one large room for three persons. We were offered free mini bar refill (peach juice, orange juice, orange soda, sparkling water, still water, coke, and etc) for the whole week. The room was clean and neat. We were amazed at size of the bathroom in the large room (around 80 sq ft). In general, we like this hotel very much!"
Aug 2018,50,Perfect location,We highly recommend Hotel Santa Justa. It’s the perfect location in old town. Excellent and hospitable customer service. Delicious breakfast buffet. Beautiful hotel and rooms. We will stay there again on our next trip to Lisbon.
Aug 2018,50,Lovely Stay and Great Location,"After a long afternoon of traveling from Lagos to Lisbon we were pleasantly welcomed by the friendly staff. They were very knowledgable and welcoming and kindly went over some of the places to go to in Lisbon and pointed them out on a map. The bellhop was especially kind and gave us a quick tour of our rooms. We booked 2 adjoining rooms which ended up being in the corner of the building across from where the receptionist desk was. Since we were in the corner we were able to get a view + balcony of two streets which was nice. My brother was particularly excited about the free mini bar that was restocked daily (water, juice, soda, beer). It was also a nice touch to welcome us with complimentary wine, a few pasteis de nata (which I was so excited to try!), as well as a box of L'Occitane mini products in one of the bathrooms. The bathroom was beautiful and was essentially all white marble - very modern. Only complaint was after the first night (we stayed for 4), one of the bathrooms started to smell horrible. We weren't sure if it was due to plumbing or what not but the smell lingered until our last night. Other than that the amenities were great and the AC was very strong/responsive. Great location and in walking distance of many attractions, restaurants, as well as Rossio station. Additionally we had no issues with noise from outside. Admittedly you could still hear things outside during the day but it wasn't really that bad. Sometimes we would hear live music too which we enjoyed. By the time we had prepared to go to sleep around 11 pm, the noise had really gone down anyways. Would recommend and return again! Thank you for the pleasant stay!"
Aug 2018,50,PERFECT!! (both room and location),"They have a newly renovated annex right next door that was AMAZING. LARGE clean new room (queen bed and queen sofa bed) and a LARGE clean new bathroom (extremely rare in Europe). Amazing shower (sad we had to leave that). But on top of that, they got the little things right:*nespresso in the room plus chocolates*a free (small) bottle of Port wine*free minibar, restocked daily. ok, not enough alcohol to get drunk, but plenty of drinks of all kinds!*2 kid welcome packets! one for the room, one for the bathroom.*TONS of charging outlets--both lots of regular electrical outlets that were easy to get to and 4 usb outlets!*Spacious elevator to room (again, not common in such smaller hotels in Europe)Oh and cannot beat the location--right next to the famous Elevator, tons of shopping and restaurants and cafes. Walked to the Castle and Alfama and everywhere, also close to metro.  We shall return!"
Aug 2018,30,Great location good service but not very clean,Great location. Almost walking distance from everything. Staff are very friendly warm and helpful. Main issue is cleanliness of hotel. Floor of room was sticky and room had a musty smell. Rooms are nicely decorated however housekeeping is not one of their strongest points. It’s superficial the cleaning done. Can just tell when you walk in to the rooms and confirmed after staying for a few nights. Good hotel if you are looking for a place as a base to explore Lisbon but if you want to enjoy the comfort of a hotel room think you need to look elsewhere. If management improved upon the housekeeping think this will be an excellent hotel.
Aug 2018,40,Great hotel in great location,"We had three lovely nights at Hotel Santa Justa Lisbon, it is located in a central location amidst numerous restaurants and great shopping strips.The hotel  rooms we more than adequate size, clean and the beds very comfortable.The buffet breakfast was of an acceptable standardThe hotel staff were excellent with their knowledge of tourist areas and the public transport system and were always very helpful.If you are searching for accommodation in Lisbon include Hotel Santa Justa"
Aug 2018,40,Boutique City Hotel,"A very good boutique hotel located in the tourist centre of Lisbon.Conveniently located for most of the tourist attractions. Tram and Lisboa Rossio station are within walking distance.Rooms are modern, well equipped and clean. With free and reliable WiFi coverage and a complimentary mini bar.Overall a very good base for our stay in Lisbon.Advice:Lisbon is a hilly city, bring appropriate shoes.Uber is very cheap and convent in Lisbon, was €10 airport-hotel and €25-30 to Sintra (30km away)."
Aug 2018,50,Great stay,Staff were very friendly and room very comfortable. Great location. Super breakfast. Smoked salmon and scrambled egg..best ever! We also had dinner there one evening and Arthur provided most professional table service
Aug 2018,50,couples holiday,clean spacious room. stayed for 2 nights. breakfast was available. nice pastiche waiting for us in room with port on arrivalgreat location and warm reception on arrivalvalue for money and would recommend this hotel
Aug 2018,50,Wonderful hotel,The hotel is in a wonderful location with outstanding service and has good restaurants on-site.  The staff is so thoughtful and really go out of their way to make sure you have a good visit.  The rooms are spacious and the beds very comfortable.  This was not our first stay at the hotel and we will definitely stay there again!
Jul 2018,50,Excellent Location,"We were greeted by Marianna, Vera, and also Nadiya when we stayed at this hotel on two different nights.  You cannot beat the location.  It is right in the heart of the center and is surrounded by cafes and shops along pedestrian paths.  It is also a short walk to all the major attractions.  We loved the location and everyone was very nice in Lisbon.  We would definitely stay here again because once again it is in the center of all the action.  Breakfast was just okay but overall we still give it a five star rating for its location, kind staff, and it is a pretty hotel.  We took a taxi to and from the hotel from the airport which was only about 25 minutes away.  We really enjoyed our stay here and look forward to our return."
Jul 2018,50,Excellent Family Stay,"Perfect Location, everything is on your doorstep, Room was really nice, got a suite for 2 x Adults and 2 x Children, very nice.toiletries for the kids on the bed when they arrived was a really nice touch, the kids loved them. small bottle of port and custard tarts left complimentary that evening,Fado singer on that evening in the restaurant. Very nice stay and would completely recommend."
Jul 2018,50,Excellent location and phenomenal service ,This was a last minute reservation and I ended up taking three rooms. The staff was extremely accommodating. We had a wonderful time at Hotel Santa Justa and we will definitely be back next year. The location was outstanding. The entire experience was over the too. Thank you for everything.
Jul 2018,40,Good value for money,Centrally located and surrounded by shops and near to two metro stations - Rossio amd Baixa. Rooms were very clean and also the toilete impeccable! Good size of rooms with ample space gor walking amd your things.Highly recommend the breakfast buffet with really very satisfactory choices of food. Very worth it! The two young waitress were very polite and helpful to guests. Real customer service amd they know how to smile. One was from East Timor and would like to commend her hard work in keeping the breakfast area clean and well replenished with food. Friendly and very approachable.
Jul 2018,50,Great hotel and location,"Really enjoyed my stay at the Santa Justa. Staff was very welcoming and friendly. In the room there's a nice greeting with Portuguese wine and a warm pastry. Breakfast was delightful, plenty of fruit ! Location is also really good, many attractions and plazas nearby."
Jul 2018,50,Hotel Santa Justa - Beyond our expectations,"Hotel Santa Justa compares to some 5 Star Hotels we have stayed in before.We stayed in the new building (apparently opened a month ago) and were really spoilt throughout our stay.They provide a free mini bar which is a welcome change from most other hotels in Europe.We also received free pastries and a small bottle of port as a welcome from their restaurant which was a nice novel touch.Not only did they provide impeccable service, they are also extremely well located in the heart of the city within walking distance to a huge variety of shops and restaurants as well as all types of public transport (Trains, Metro, Trams, Busses and Ferries)Highly recommend Hotel Santa Justa (Lisbon)."
Jul 2018,50,Fantastic!,"Great hotel with wonderful accommodations and a very close proximity to all of the action of the city.  Very friendly staff, clean and modern rooms, along with a nicely stocked mini bar that is replenished daily."
Jul 2018,40,Very nice hotel,"We stayed at the Santa Justa hotel in May. It is in an ideal location with everything within walking distance. The rooms are very clean and well equipped. There are some nice extra touches like the chocolates, wine & cakes.  Breakfast was lovely though they were slow to replenish some items.  The staff were very friendly & very helpful."
Jul 2018,50,Best location in Lisbon,Staff was wonderful...great views from highest floor rooms....and superb location in La Baixa.Well equipped rooms with a lot of free amenities. I loved white and clean bathrooms. Incredible shower fixture. I’ll come back.
Jul 2018,50,Short but great stay!,"We stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa at the end of June and it was amazing. Unfortunately we were only able to stay one night as our airlines changed our flight to the day before but everything about the hotel was great. I loved the location and while it may bother some people that you can't access via the street, it's literally steps away from the hotel. It's close to walking everywhere and so close to the water.In terms of the hotel in itself the rooms were very spacious and I LOVED all of the amenities they provided you with. We stayed in 6 different cities/hotels on our trip and this was one of the best we stayed in. We also had dinner at the hotel and the food was phenomenal.The only downside I would say is the breakfast was disappointing. It was included in our rate so I wouldn't pay for it if you had the choice again because there are so many other restaurants nearby. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel!"
Jul 2018,50,In A Great Spot,Want to be in the midst of shops and restaurants? Then choose Santa Justa (2nd time for us). Rooms are modern and large by European standards. Pleasant and knowledgeable staff. Breakfast was great with even Mimosas included. Comfortable bed and well appointed bathrooms/showers.
Jul 2018,50,Great hotel and location,We loved our stay at Hotel Santa Justa! Location was amazing and staff was wonderful. LOTS of great amenities and cool balconies over looking the street. Highly recommend. Walking distance from everything!
Jul 2018,50,Great Hotel,The location is perfect and close to the Elevator which we could see out of our 6th floor window. The room and amenities were a nice touch. Free mini-bar and wi-fi. The rain head shower was great in the bathroom. Loved the bottle of Port and egg custard tarts upon our arrival. Nice variety for breakfast buffet. We enjoyed the Fado music one night in the lobby. The front desk was very helpful and we appreciated the advice they offered. The hotel is on a pedesterian mall and you have to walk 1/2 a block to get a cab. The evening before our departure we were given a bottle of sparkling wine and some chocolates. We would definitely stay here again. Close to lots of sights.
Jul 2018,50,Best hotel of our trip; superb staff,"*The location couldn't be better; central with easy metro/train access; on a pedestrian-only street, all types of restaurants nearby;*Room:  My first-floor room had WiFi and AC problems, so staff moved me to one of their 4th floor, balconied rooms and it was spectacular.  One evening, watched really good gymnasts on the street below.  Shower has an enormous rainhead shower; all linens were of excellent quality*I tried to exhaust the staff by asking too many questions, and it didn't work. They are endlessly helpful."
Jul 2018,40,Excellent location,Perfect location in central Lisbon. Helpful reception staff. We conveniently had adjoining rooms to accommodate 5 family members. Room were quiet (4th floor) despite a busy pedestrian street below. Modern amenities. The only negative was the fact that breakfast wasn't included for rooms that ran $300/night. Breakfast was on par with those typically included in European hotels (and definitely not worth 15 Euros).
Jul 2018,50,Love this hotel!,We had the superior room with two twins beds - very clean and the staff was extremely friendly. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to stay in downtown Lisbon. Just a 5-10 minute walk to the ocean and is right in the middle of tons of shops and restaurants. The beds are very clean and comfortable.
Jul 2018,40,Solid city centre hotel,"This covers a 3 night stay in an entry level twin room. The hotel is very centrally located in Lisbon, with most attractions within a 10-20 min walk away (albeit sometimes a very steep walk!). The entrance is situated along a cobblestoned street which is pedestrian only, and there are a row of restaurants here which are definitely made for tourists, but still ended up being a nice spot to have a drink and soak up some atmosphere.The rooms are well appointed and easily in the 4-star category, which is as advertised. We were a group of 11 people with separately made bookings. My allocated room was a bit cramped, and I did get a bit jealous seeing the rooms others in our group had been appointed, even though most had booked the same rate. For example, my room had no writing desk, full length wardrobe space, balcony or even robe/slippers, while others had all of these things. On that note, only the rooms on the first and second floors have balconies, out of a total of 6 floors in the hotel main building.The hotel did have some nice touches like a free minibar (water, soft drinks and a single beer per day). I enjoyed the rainfall shower! Staff were quite friendly when encountered. Overall, a solid city centre hotel which seemed fairly priced. I would consider them for future stays, but would probably look at booking a higher room category."
Jul 2018,50,Fantastic Hotel in a Great Location,"We spent 4 nights in Lisbon at this hotel.  I booked it not knowing what a great location it was in and what a nice surprise that was.  It is in the pedestrian area that is loaded with restaurants and shops, close to historical squares and other sites.  The Santa Justa Elevator is within eyeshot.  The front desk was exceedingly friendly and the room was very nice.  We ate (and drank) in the area a few times and it is safe, friendly and very lively.  I could not have been happier with my hotel selection."
Jun 2018,50,A Well Located and Friendly Hotel,"I recently stayed at this hotel prior to a cruise. The hotel is well located near the Santa Justa Elevator and most of the sights in Baixa. The staff was very cordial and helpful with requests.The room I received had a great view and was on a high floor, thus quiet for sleeping. It had gratis drinks in the refrigerator and a coffee maker in the room. A full breakfast with lots of choices was included.I would definitely return to this hotel when I am back in Lisbon."
Jun 2018,30,A week in Santa Justa Hotel,The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Hotel is clean and offers a reasonable buffet breakfast. The same facility offered lunch and dinner. Rates 3/5.  Rooms were reasonably spacious and lacked for nothing. It is situated on one of the main tourist roads in old town Lisbon.  Note: the street cafes are expensive and the food is not very nice.
Jun 2018,50,A Destination Hotel for Us!,"Hotel is located perfectly for walking tours and great restaurants or entertainment.  Like most travelers, we arrived tired and received the best reception and greeting.  Rooms were quiet and clean, comfortable with ample space and great showers.  We had dinner one night and there was a fabulous FADO entertainment.  The food and service was equal to some of the best restaurants we visited.  We enjoyed our stay so much we rebooked for our return night before departing Lisbon.  Great Hotel and great customer service!"
Jun 2018,50,Great stay  at Hotel Santa Justa,"This hotel had beautiful, comfortable rooms (great shower!) and was quiet and peaceful.  Great location, in a nice neighborhood near many restaurants.  The food at the hotel restaurant was good, and we were even treated to live Fado music one evening.  What really made the stay exceptional though, was the attentive and friendly staff.  Everyone was wonderful!"
Jun 2018,50,Justa what we wanted,"The Hotel Santa Justa is a hotel in two parts. There is a reception, a dining area and guest rooms on one side of the street and on the other side of the street there is a newly renovated building with  additional guest rooms which is where we stayed. Everything was clean, new and fresh. The rooms are of a reasonable size. There was coffee and a coffee machine and a complimentary mini bar. The bathroom was huge and entirely of marble. The shower a spacious walk in. Press the green button if you want housekeeping. The red button if you don't.This hotel is in an excellent central location, with many bars, shops and restaurants quite literally on the doorstep. Noise did not present as a problem as we were located on the second floor.The Elevador de Santa Justa is just around the corner and anything else you may need, taxi, tuk tuk, bus tours, tram, metro, no more than a 10 minute walk. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend."
Jun 2018,50,"Great location, great service","Excellent location at the crossroads of two pedestrian streets, just a couple blocks either way from two different subway stations. Many sights and restaurants in walking distance.Very helpful staff, and a lot of attention to small details - great shower, nice hairdryer, comfortable bed, very quiet. Good breakfast also!"
Jun 2018,20,Eww,"I’m actually writing this from the hotel and glad that there’s only two more nights here. The good: great location! Relatively clean. Rooms spacious. Free WIFi. Free minibar. Free mini bottle of port the first day, along with two pastries. The bad: the hotel faces a street that no cars are allowed on, so do not expect door-to-door taxis nor Uber’s. The bathroom is horrible. There’s some mold growing in between the tiles and you kinda have to launch yourself into the bathing area. I’m 5’2” and everytime I took a shower, I prayed that I survived the descent. The first day, my husband had to ask housekeeping to clean up the floor in there because it was super sticky. When you are traveling with a toddler, this is exactly what you want to happen 😞. The second day, I returned to the room while housekeeping was in there and the door was wide open. I was able to walk in, fill up a water bottle, walk around and still she didn’t realize I was there. Thankfully, we didn’t leave anything valuable out. I’m not sure if it’s a Portuguese thing but the front desk ladies usually gritted their teeth while answering questions. As if it’s a chore. Overall, the location is great for walking to a lot of the sights nearby."
Jun 2018,50,Lisbon,"Great hotel, best location in Lisbon. Outstanding service,  extremely clean, beautiful rooms, great food and drink and entertainment.  I travel a lot for business, and the staff at hotel are absolutely incredible.  Not only are they extremely professional, but at the same time they make me feel right at home.  It’s also very impressive that everyone always offer the same excellence in service"
Jun 2018,20,“Very bad soundproofing with the neighboring room. Not acceptable in a **** Hotel”,"Very bad soundproofing with the neighboring room ......You can hear walking, speaking, TV, shower....etc. Difficult to sleep well with these conditions. The location is excellent, very central in Lisbon but in an area full of tourists. The breakfast staff is very accommodating.Missing a comfortable lounge"
Jun 2018,50,"Great hotel, great location!","We highly recommended this hotel! The staff was friendly and helpful, the accommodations were wonderful (comfortable beds, free mini bar), and the breakfast was tasty. The hotel's location was perfect. A short walk will take you to the Praça do Comércio in one direction, or to the train station at Rossio Square in the other direction. There is no shortage of dining options in the area (but the waiters on the street right outside the hotel were quite rude in their attempts to get you to sit at their tables). On our last night in Lisbon we ate dinner at the hotel's restaurant which, unfortunately, was a bit disappointing. While my wife enjoyed her ""Duck Magret"", I found the ""Codfish Santa Justa Style"" dry and over-cooked. Even so, we left the restaurant in good spirits after the evening's Fado singer serenaded us. We will definitely stay at the Santa Justa again on our next visit."
Jun 2018,50,Perfect Location to see Lisbon,"What a great hotel. It's clean, quiet and located in a pedestrianised area of the old town. There's great restaurants all around it and the food in the hotel is also excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed the Fado performance as well laid on by the hotel. Very close to a number of squares where you can catch trams to Belem and the train to Sintra from Rossio station. Santa Justa elevator is about 200 yards away and the Tagus is about 15 mins walk away with some great squares and bars along it."
Jun 2018,50,Perfect Location & Great Stay,"The hotel is centrally located in a pedestrian only neighborhood. There are restaurants and shops within easy walking distance, and the Rossio train station is a short walk away. The staff is helpful, especially Fabio at the front desk and Maria in housekeeping."
Jun 2018,40,Centrally located,Great position close to many tourist attractions and easy walk to trams metros and taxis.  Staff are extremely efficient and helpful.  Comfortable quiet rooms and the cherry on the top is a free mini bar with an assortment of cool drinks although we only discovered this on the last day!  Very modern hotel with the biggest rain shower I’ve ever seen.   Abundant supply of restaurants and shops right on your doorstep.  Only one drawback is that the hotel is on a  pedestrian mall so taxis are not allowed to the door after 10am.  Fortunately there is a taxi rank just a short walk away and the hotel porter very kindly helped us with  luggage to the taxi.
May 2018,50,Great Hotel,"Centrally located and very appealing. We had a lovely room with balcony and view. Good street for a hotel as it has no trams or cars, so quiet by late night. Hotel restaurant is well worth a try. They are happy to serve a full meal or just a snack. Friendly staff. Would recommend this hotel to anyone."
May 2018,50,"Location, personnel couldn't be better","You couldn't ask for a better location or experience with hotel personnel. Room was wonderful with in-room tech and all the bathroom amenities necessary for a wonderful experience. Sound proofing is excellent since even though there is construction right outside the window, no construction or streetnoise was ever heard. Convenient to everything with just a short walk to fabulous cafe, Santa Justa elevator, hop-on hop-off bus and pedestrian walking avenue. Would absolutely stay again."
May 2018,50,Best hotel stay ever!,"Every little touch in the room impressed my partner and I. The freshness of the room, tall ceilings, French doors opening towards the beautiful pedestrian street, in-room tech, and bed comfort. Even though we had a minor hiccup at check-in which was our fault, the hotel personnel (Fabio) made sure everything ended on a positive note!! Can’t wait to return to Lisbon and stay here again."
May 2018,50,"Lovely Front Desk Personnel, Outstanding Room, Good Value","We scrambled to book this hotel when our flight got cancelled and the hotel we had been staying in had no free rooms left. Had we known about Hotel Santa Justa, we would have stayed there the entire trip. The front desk staff could not have been nicer. The hotel provides free juice and water in the room's mini-bar. The bathroom was the only of our 7 hotels on this trip that stocked the bathroom with hair conditioner. The room was street-facing and only one flight up, but very quiet--silent. The quality of the windows' sound-proofing and seal was phenomenal! There was also construction on the street below going on and yet not only was the room silent but also dust free. Finally, it was the first hotel that got the ventilation and a/c in the room right: it was very comfortable. I can't recommend this hotel enough."
May 2018,50,A little gem in the heart of Lisbon,Gorgeous hotel in the centre of Lisbon.Very warm welcome from reception. Room not ready as we were early morning arrivals. Cases taken and stored. Map supplied with plenty of personal hints and tips from the chap behind reception.Lovely room and bathroom. Port and custard tarts supplied as a welcome gift.On the first night we tramped around a very busy Lisbon looking for somewhere to eat. Everywhere was full. Plodded back to the hotel very disheartened to be met by the maitre d at the hotel restaurant. He whisked us in and we were sorted in minutes. It was also fado night and so were treated to live music all through our delicious meal. Service and food excellent. A truly memorable evening and one we won’t forget in a hurry.Breakfast plentiful and fresh.We booked the hotel airport transfer and were extremely impressed.All round a highly recommended hotel.
May 2018,50,Really Excellent Boutique Hotel,"This is a gem of a hotel.  It is located in a pedestrian area walking distance to great shopping.  The exterior of the building is charming and old in appearance, but the interior is completely modern and clean beyond reproach (critical to us).  From start to finish, every effort was made to ensure our comfort and enjoyment before and during our stay.  To begin, the hotel emailed an offer to arrange transportation from the airport to the hotel.  So glad we took them up on this, as Pedro was so terrific that we hired him as our driver for a day of museum hopping and tour of the city.  The arrangement was set up for us to pay the driver directly for the transfer - no hotel markup.Upon arriving we were checked in early and showed to our rooms, which were spacious There were chocolates on our pillows and a little bag with L'Occitane Lavender Spray and lotion with a lovely welcoming note.  A bit later, room service brought up two small bottles of wine and some special pastries that Lisboa is known for.   We were traveling with our daughter and had booked the Family Suite.  Our room had a European style tub with a hand held shower wand.  Our daughter's room had a walk in shower with rain shower and hand held wand.  You might want to inquire which your room will include. EVERY amenity we could possibly need (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, bath sponge, dental kit, shaving kit, shoe kit, sewing/nail kit, comb and on it went) was on hand.  Linens were high end and bathrooms included bath sheets, which we appreciated. Rooms include a mini fridge that was fully stocked with various beverages.  This was refilled daily and was complimentary.The hotel has a nice little restaurant that offers a breakfast buffet and dinner service.  On Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday they offer live Fado music, which was charming.We are leaving tomorrow and decided to have our last meal at the hotel.  The waiter brought a complimentary bottle of wine and wished us well.  Staff later stopped by with champagne and chocolates.  (We should note that we do not drink alcohol, which confused them greatly - we are used to this. The above mentioned waiter took 10% off our bill instead.)Hotel staff is friendly and assisted with recommendations/reservations for restaurants and printing documents for us.  We absolutely recommend the Hotel Santa Justa to anyone visiting Lisboa."
May 2018,50,Glad I Chose to Stay at Santa Justa,"I was really looking forward to my stay at Santa Justa because of its location, all the positive reviews I read, and how modern the rooms looked. When I arrived, I wasn't disappointed. Santa Justa is in the best location and made traveling to all the places I wanted to visit a breeze and saved me time. Praca Comercio, Santa Justa elevator, Rossio train station, Bairro-Alo, are all a short walk away. We got lucky and got a corner attic room which was super spacious and quiet. From our little attic window, we could see the top of the Santa Justa elevator. The welcome gift (a small bottle of port wine and two pasteis de nata) were a nice touch. The best part is the free mini bar! The water , sodas, nd juices came in handy and I didn't have a need to buy water since the mini bar is restocked every day. The free L'Occitane products were great. All the staff were very nice.The not so good things are that the restaurants downstairs try really hard to get customers and I am hounded every time I walk back to the hotel or leave."
May 2018,40,"A very good choice,I wish I could come back!","This pretty hotel is located in the center of the lower part of the town.The Metro and other public transport are nearby,very comfortable during spring rain! (In this case the hotel offers even umbrellas to use by their guests) Rooms are not very big but comfortable,cosy and quiet.The only negative point,bathroom and the small closet have a common sliding door,means one of both stays open.On the other side,the minibar was included in the room price and a little bottle of Porto offered as a welcome.Very nice!The staff  at the reception did a great job and has been very helpful.Unfortunately in Lissabon the high season begins in April already what means prices become rather high and this hotel is not an exeption."
May 2018,50,Amazing location!,"Hotel Santa Justa is the perfect choice if you're visiting Lisbon for the first time. The location is PRIME! In fact, I would happily stay there again. The room was spacious and the staff was warm and friendly."
May 2018,50,Fabulous stay,"We have just returned from a 3 day break in lovely Lisbon. This hotel proved to be a fabulous choice in every way.The situation is perfect for walking to most parts of the city. We had a double comfort room which was perfect, spotless with a lovely big shower and bathroom. We asked for a high floor and the hotel were able to great our request, no noise nuisance at all. Breakfast provided all the usual hot fare with fruit and pastries on offer too.  We ate in the restaurant on our last evening and had a lovely steak and at least we didn’t have to run the gauntlet of restaurant ‘grabbers’ every 5 paces. Every staff member we encountered were unfailingly polite and friendly. If we visit Lisbon again we wouldn’t consider staying anywhere else. The only mistake we made was to pick up a cab on arrival at the airport at a cost of 50€ for 4. The hotel arranged a cab for our return at 25€. A well recommended hotel."
May 2018,50,Great Hotel,"Very friendly and service minded staff, great location in the citycenter. Rooms are clean. The restaurant/bar at the hotel is nice and the staff gave really good service as well. Close to almost everything in Lisbon!"
Apr 2018,50,Wonderful Hotel in Lisbon,"We were 3 sisters traveling in Lisbon staying 3 nights in April. The Santa Justa was perfect. The location was excellent for walking everywhere. We loved how it was on a pedestrian-only street after 10am. The breakfast was excellent - eggs, yogurt, pastries - so much to choose from. The rooms were spacious, the beds super comfortable The complimentary mini bar, bottle of wine and pastries left for us on check-in are the details that made Santa Justa our favorite hotel of the 4 we stayed in during our Portugal trip. If all that weren't enough, the customer service of the desk staff was top notch. Friendly, professional, helpful. Pedro and Vera made our stay so pleasant. Always friendly and with the best tips and suggestions. Thank you for everything!"
Apr 2018,50,Great Place for Short Stay,"My wife and planned a two week stay in Lisbon. The room assigned to us was a bit small for that long a stay. I asked the Hotel to change which they did immeadiately. The hotel was crowded but they found a great room for us. The staff was exteremly helpful throughout our stay. Baixa is a very walkable neighborhood. Maybe a little too walkable. By the end of our stay it was quite crowded with tourists. I would recommend visiting in March or early April. Hotel is close to transportation hub for Taxis (which I found to be quite reasonalbe) Uber, Tuk Tuks, trains and underground metro."
Apr 2018,50,Great Location and service,The hotel is located near Rossio station where most of the actions are so it’s very easy to get out and about. Room is very clean. Minibar is complimentary so very helpful as it could be a bit trigger to find a convenient store nearby the hotel. Staff was very helpful and polite. Highly recommend.
Apr 2018,50,Great location for Lisbon exploration.,"Everything about our few days at this hotel were positive.  Great location with easy access to transit options.  Could walk to most of central, historic Lisbon.  Except for early morning, the street is pedestrian friendly which invited wandering, sitting at cafes/restaurants without car interruptions.The staff was friendly, courteous, professional and accommodating.  We had great suggestions including an introduction to a guide for a full-day excursion which was exceptional.Breakfast was hearty and good quality and if your stay includes the day they have Fado music in the bar - take advantage, it was great.  Would stay here again."
Apr 2018,50,On a business trip taking my wife as well,Had a conference to attend in Lisbon and decided to take a few days before to explore the city. We stayed at Santa Justa. The welcome was very friendly. And we were given a bottle of port to enjoy. The staff could not do enough. Then to top off the experience they delivered chocolates and champagne as a birthday present for my wife. Took us a while to work out how they knew. Great location. Highly recommended. Will come again.
Apr 2018,50,"Quality, centrally based hotel","Stayed here for three nights in a comfort room on floor 4. Room was clean and big enough, with added bonus of free mini bar and safe. Powerful shower and good quality toiletries. Slippers and bathrobe as well! Evening meal was reasonable but avoid breakfast; expensive and better to venture out to one of the many cafes in the immediate area. Nice touch was the complimentary small bottle of port and mini custard tart. No view as such and minimal noise from the streets so sleeping no problem. Reception helped with booking of evening meals out but ignore the sales pitch for trips etc.E.g. if you fancy going to Sintra take the train and save a lot!"
Apr 2018,40,Friendly experience,The hotel is well situated on a pedestrian street with access to local amenities within easy reach.The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast buffet is very good with food to suit all tastes.  Would recommend this hotel.
Apr 2018,50,This is the Hotel in Baixa you should book ....,"I recently stayed at Hotel Santa Justa with my Mum and we were both really impressed.Firstly the location right in the middle of bustling Baixa is a perfect base for exploring the sights of beautiful Lisbon.  Even though the hotel has an excellent central location the hotel is placed on one of the pedestrian lanes and noise was not an issue at all.  Our room was great; extremely comfortable large bed, probably the world’s most comfortable pillows, flat screen TV with good selection of channels in several languages, coffee pod machine and table and chairs.  The en-suite bathroom was spotlessly clean for our entire stay and includes a very large walk-in waterfall shower which was simply amazing!The rest of the hotel is also clean and well organised.  There is a small restaurant and also a bar area with sofas and armchairs.  The food in the restaurant was extremely good and the Hotel also has live Fado singers a couple of times a week which is a nice touch.The thing that stands out the most though is the restaurant and bar staff; they are without doubt the most genuinely friendly and helpful staff I have ever come across and send out a great vibe.  For that reason alone I would choose to re-book with Hotel Santa Justa for a return trip to Lisbon – and there will be a return trip as it’s a fantastic city!  I would highly recommend the Hotel Santa Justa."
Apr 2018,50,Beautiful hotel and great location,"We have been to many hotels in Europe and this is by far one of the best. Clean, comfortable rooms, friendly staff who spoke english and were helpful with booking a car to the airport and recommending travel days and so on. The hotel bar and Fado music topped off 2 greats days of touring. The location is by far the best for everywhere we wanted to be. This is a prime hotel and we highly recommend it - we will stay here again when in Lisbon"
Apr 2018,50,Hotel Santa Justa -Lisbon,"We can’t say enough about our 5 night stay in this perfectly restored historical building. The staff was hospitable, always their for our questions and needs, so friendly, spoke English tho loved teaching us useful words and phrases! Helped us find fun local places to dine, wash clothes, walking highlights etc. The room! Wow! Comfortable bedding,  fresh air with the balcony door, awesome bathroom, in room safe, complimentary nespresso and cups as well as other special touches, on and on! Upon check out there was a small box of chocolates & a hand written note to us from management. We absolutely love this hotel and breakfasts and bar staff. Highly recommend!"
Apr 2018,40,great hotel in city centre location,"Hotel has fab central location, walking distance from many attractions and right by trams/buses for others.  Staff spoke excellent English, were super friendly and suggested and booked an excellent resturant for us.  Room was reasonable size with a large bathroom (shower only), mini bar stocked daily with free water, sodas and juices and a welcome gift of port and custard tarts on our first day. Breakfast was buffet style in bar area by reception - usual range of cold meats/fruit, hot eggs/bacon/beans and breads/cakes. This area also functions as a bar/restuarant throught the day with tables on the street also."
Apr 2018,40,Super City Hotel,"Close to all the tourist attractions and the staff is very kind and super helpful. Nice room with big bathroom, clean and quiet. Order the airport pick-up service it just adds to the positive experience."
Apr 2018,50,Great place to stay,"We stayed in two rooms for 7 nights. The hotel was spotless, check in very easy and the location is right in the heart of the city. Although we were offered a discount for breakfast, I would have liked to have seen the discount be a bit better. We did eat breakfast twice in the hotel - and the options were terrific - and the staff wonderful. However we were a party of four and it was a little steep in cost versus going outside the hotel to eat. In terms of the rooms, I cannot say enough! Very spacious - beds super comfortable, bathroom enormous with plenty of light and soundproofing excellent! Should we return to Lisbon, we will not look anywhere else! The location was so wonderful for walking to sites. If you wanted a cab, train or trolley, you were literally footsteps away! Do not hesitate -  book here!"
Mar 2018,50,Hotel Santa Just a-Lisbon,"I am rating this a 5 star experience. It begins with the staff, to the rooms, the pastéis de nana awaiting you in your room, the breakfasts, the bar staff, and lastly the wonderful box of chocolates and personal note in your room before checking out. The location was perfect in the historic section of Lisbon. Easy for the Euro traveller walking everywhere. What a beautiful experience and Hotel Santa Justa deserves mention for our memorable trip to Lisbon! We will definitely stay here again if we are lucky enough to return to Lisbon again."
Mar 2018,50,"Great location, friendly staff !","This hotel is centrally located, clean and offers a great breakfast that includes fresh mango and papaya! The staff was very helpful and made our rainy days there bright. A green bowl of apples at the reception is a welcoming touch!"
Mar 2018,50,Great Hotel Great Location Great Price,"Super nice hotel in a prime location of Lisbon. Comfortable bed, amazing service and a free mini bar with some nice beverages.   It was a shame we only stayed here one night.   When I return I’ll be staying here again"
Mar 2018,50,Great stay in Lisbon,"I struggled to make our hotel selection and am so glad I picked this hotel and Lisbon. The hotel is in a great central location and we walked to most areas we wanted to visit. The staff was very helpful with any questions we had, and gave great advice. Lisbon was a four night layover from our main trip and ended up being the highlight of our vacation."
Mar 2018,50,Excellent Choice in Lisbon,"We stayed for 5 nights in late February . The hotel is in an ideal central location. We took a taxi from the airport ( €17) and he dropped us at the Santa Justa Lift- the hotel is less that 2 minutes walk from here on a pedestrian street. We were greeted warmly at reception and the welcome gift of port and pastiche was a nice touch.The room was comfortable and quiet over night. breakfast was a buffet and always plenty on offer. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel as there are so many choices around. The hotel is in a perfect location for accessing Lisbon sights with Rossio station nearby, although lots of Lisbon is accessible by foot or tram. we were supposed to stay 4 nights but due to flight cancellation we had to arrange an extra night and the hotel were very helpful allowing us to remain in our room which was much appreciated."
Mar 2018,50,Very good choice in Lisbon,"The hotel is perfectly located in Lisbon historical centre, just few steps from the main square. It quite and clean place. Good breakfast. Good quality of sleeping. WiFi works well. Very helpful staff. Perfect choice."
Mar 2018,50,One word.......amazing !!,Just on the train going back to Albufeira after staying 1 night in Lisbon. So sad to leave this hotel. Absolutely beautiful right in the centre. The staff were amazing and helpful. The facilities and extras in the room were totally thought out from toiletries right through to a mini sewing kit !! If I ever return to Lisbon I word return to this hotel without a moment's hesitation.
Mar 2018,40,Nice stay,"Stayed in a standard room and it was very comfortable and modern.  Breakfast was fine, a little soulless but it does the job.  The chef could do more to replace the hot items to be fresh, the eggs in particular were very dry having been under the hot plate lights for a while. The staff at reception were very helpful and courteous, they are a credit to the hotel and couldn’t do any more to make our stay comfortable.  Well done."
Mar 2018,50,Great Hotel in a fantastic location,"What a perfect location to explore Lisbon from, it's on a lovely cobbled pedestrian street with the tram, metro & bus stops nearby. The staff are friendly and so helpful, telling us the best ways to reach local attractions and even printing out bus timetables. We were upgraded to suite having booked a superior room and the room was large, with a seating area. Unfortunately we didn't have a great view as the building across the road was being renovated but it didn't matter as we out during the day. The breakfast buffet was good with lots of hot & cold choices. I would definitely recommend this hotel, hoping I will go back myself one day."
Feb 2018,50,Comfortable and accommodating hotel,"We had such a nice stay in Lisbon at Hotel Santa Justa. The staff is kind, friendly, and helpful. They helped us find train times and showed us the best metro routes. The free mini bar in the room was a very nice thing to come back to each night. It was also sweet to get the complementary port and custard pastries. The hotel is on a nice walking street and easily walkable to so many sites and public transport. There is such a nice, local weekend market in the square at the end of the street. We so enjoyed Lisbon and Portugal and this hotel made our stay even more special. I hope we can return someday."
Feb 2018,50,Excellent stay in the heart of lisbon,Hotel staff extremely helpful and welcoming.  Hotel has a great location a  short walk will bring you into the heart of lisbon.  Book a superior room spacious & clean.  What really makes this hotel a great place to stay is it a friendly staff.
Feb 2018,50,LOCATION IS EVERYTHING --- THIS IS IT.,"Really good hotel, friendly staff, good breakfast. The hotel is one block from Rossio Square in the center of the old city. A short walk to the river, plenty of restaurants and cafes right outside your door.  Rooms were clean and decent size."
Feb 2018,40,"Good location, friendly personal",We came to Lisbon for leisure and sightseeing and this hotel was an ideal place to stay. Quite at night and close to bus stops and places of interest. The friendly staff made our stay even more enjoyable.
Feb 2018,50,Location ,Great hotel that’s all about location. Staff couldn’t be more helpful and friendly. Rooms are small but perfectly formed. Didn’t eat there as location meant eateries on the doorstep. Would recommend this hotel.
Feb 2018,50,Lovely hotel and perfect location,Perfectly positioned hotel.  Very clean and modern.  The staff were very helpful and polite and answered all our questions on where to eat and visit. The little touches of L'Occitane gift bag and the bottle of port and custard tarts in our room on arrival were very welcome!Can't recommend this hotel highly enough and would stay here again if we came back to Lisbon.
Feb 2018,50,A Better location imposible ,"We book in this hotel for the reviews that we saw in tripadvisor and they were right, really good location, close to many of the touristic buildings and with easy access (bus, metro, aerobús and touristic bus) and a nice hotel with friendly staff. Clean rooms and good breakfast"
Feb 2018,50,Lisbon,"Hotel Santa Justa is a very nice hotel centrally located in Lisbon, walking distance to many attractions and restaurants.  All of the hotel staff were very helpful with directions and suggestions for what restaurants to try.  I'd certainly recommend this hotel."
Feb 2018,50,great location and staff,Great location on quiet street.  we could walk to everything with easy access to Metro.Staff had best recomendations for resturants - best food ever.  Fodo music in hotel resturant was fun.  Rossio square one block away.

Feb 2018,50,💖Justa Fantastico!💖,"Spent 3 nights last weekend at this fabulous little boutique hotel and would highly recommend in a heartbeat to anyone looking to stay in Lisbon!Granted it was a birthday treat with my husband however I don’t tend to wear rose tinted spectacles and see things as they are.   The hotel arranged taxi transfers from and to the airport which were faultless other than the drivers were a little over chatty for me after a flight and the return an early ride back to the airport.All members of the hotel team are simply delightful! A special mention to Nadya who from the moment we arrived to the moment we left gave excellent customer service, nothing was a problem, always smiling - a credit to this hotel!Nadya explained the yellow bus tour to us and recommended the most amazing restaurant for my birthday.  Our room had twin beds albeit pushed together and Nadya arranged for the beds to be made up as a double whilst we were out! Wow!  Employee of the month for me.We had a lovely room no 109 a dual aspect with 3 floor to ceiling windows, mini bar, bathrobes, slippers and l’occitane mini toiletries on the bed - I had to leave behind because of my Ryanair allowance and could not squeeze in sadly.Comfy bed and sheets changed daily, amazing shower with led lighting which made me chuckle! Disco shower.  We were brought Portuguese pastries, little bottle of port and fruit in the room.Breakfast buffet style and the hot element could be improved, prefer eggs freshly cooked as the scrambled looked solid, the fried eggs like warm with solid yokes.  Sparkling wine was a treat at breakfast and enough pastries and special coffee you can consume.The hotel staff brought me a cake with a candle to breakfast and Nadya sang happy birthday to me, I had tears in my eyes it was lovely! Such a shock.This hotel is perfectly located you can walk to many sights and restaurants.The cultural Fado music with guitar and local singers was delightful on Sunday evening - I think we should have eaten in the hotel that night to have enjoyed more.Superb! Excelente! Fantastico!"
Feb 2018,50,Location location location,"good hotel in the pedestrian area, lots of restaurants close by. we had a ""fado"" local culture evening over dinner, they organised airport transfers, quiet comfortable. the only thing was we are elderly so we could not get into and out of the bean bag chairs - normal chairs woulg have been better"
Jan 2018,50,A M A Z I N G,"We were passing by the hotel and were invited to listen a fado and drink some wine, simply AMAZING EXPERIENCE a must do in Lisbon Discover the best of Lisbon starting in the Hotel Santa Justa By the way, the service was GREAT simply GREAT in the restaurant"
Jan 2018,40,"Lovely, well located hotel","We spent just under a week at Santa Justa.  The hotel is well lcoated in the Baixa section, walking distance to many attractions and close to the trolley for Belem.  The hotel is comfortable with excellent service from the staff.  We tend to prefer small hotels and this one suited us well."
Jan 2018,50,Wonderful Hotel - great staff,"We loved everything about this hotel!  We stayed with our baby and the room had a nice little pack n play cot set up with cute little gifts for the baby in there.  The room and bathroom were very clean and modern.  One reason we chose this hotel was because of the flat area (no hills) so it was easy to walk around everywhere with the stroller.  Right outside pedestrian only,  and there's cute outdoor dining so it was lively.  We were able to walk to a bunch of different restaurants and areas with no problem.   The only thing was we did find the hotel's airport transfer to the hotel more expensive than an uber would have been. (We chose the hotels airport transfer since they were able to provide an infant carseat for us, which we were happy with) - but once in the city we found a lot of uber cars and they were pretty cheap!  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and hope to stay here again!"
Jan 2018,50,Very friendly staff,"We didn’t actually stay here but went in to ask the staff about somewhere we could print tickets for a concert. The staff were so friendly and helpful and straight away gave us their email address so that they could print for us. Such a kind gesture offered with great service at no charge. Ladies, thank you so much for your help :)"
Jan 2018,50,Greatt hotel for Lisbon visit,"We stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa over Christmas and could not have been more pleased. Location is perfect - right in the middle of the Baixa/Chialdo area on a pedestrian street. Street noise in our room was non-existant even though our room faced the street!  Our room, a Superior Triple, was spacious with a huge bathroom, lovely extra-large bath towels, room was very clean as was bathroom. Front desk  staff very professional, friendly, helpful with restaurants (we didn't go wrong at any of the ones the staff recommended.) Lobby very nice, breakfast huge, great variety  and well-stocked."
Dec 2017,40,Great location,"This hotel is actually located on a pedestrian street in the heart of the tourist restaurants of Lisbon,but don't let that discourage you!! It is so centrally located that it was easy to get everywhere in Lisbon. Clean, quiet, centrally located...I will be staying here again!"
Dec 2017,50,Will book in this hotel again with no second thoughts!,"Excellently located, this is a small hotel with spacious rooms, and helpful and friendly staff. Special commendation to Nadia who went out of her way to make our stay a pleasant one.Beds are comfortable, rooms are appropriately lighted. The toilet sink has enough space to put your cosmetics and stuff on. Walk in shower floor isn’t slippery and have grab bars all around it maximizing safety of guests. A golf ball shaped soap sits on a soap dish which is cool. Complimentary coffee is served at the lobby. This hotel has practically everything a traveller needs. I’ll book again without any second thoughts!"
Dec 2017,50,"Great Location, Friendly Staff, Recommend the Hote","Great location, friendly staff and very clean rooms with comfortable beds. Right in middle of the old town, so taxi’s cannot pull up directly in front of hotel, you will need to walk a short distance to get to the entrance of the hotel. No sitting area in the lobby though particularly if you wanted to wait for trains or planes. We had the disabled room, so it was of a nice size. Would recommend this hotel if you are staying in Lisbon for either business or leisure."
Dec 2017,50,"Amazing Stay, Great Location!","We stayed one night at this hotel in early October.  We chose this hotel because of it’s wonderful location, and it seems to be the best one (based on reviews we read) in the Baixa district.  The hotel is located on a pedestrian-only street (short walk from where the taxis drop you off), and you have to walk past restaurants with staff constantly trying to lure you in for a drink or meal. It’s also a short walk from the one of the famous bakeries and a couple of blocks away from the waterfront.  The hotel is also really close to the Santa Justa elevator, but we did not choose to queue up and ascend the tower for the views over Lisbon.We were extremely pleased with our stay – we received incredible customer service from the concierge, cleaning, and restaurant staff.  We were pleasantly surprised by the number of gift surprises we received from the hotel – as welcome gifts we received a L’Occitane travel gift set (contains shampoo, conditioner, hand location, soap bar, shower gel, pillow spray, and lip balm); later in the evening, a staff member also came and delivered two custard tarts (pasteis) and a bottle of port wine.  Thank you so much!When you enter the room, there's a contemporary, new, fresh-feel to the room.  Bathroom amenities are also provided.  We found that this is one of the rare hotels that offers a soap dish for the hand soap - very nice touch!Note that the drinks from the minibar (as well as the coffee from the Nespresso machine) do not have additional charge, which is a great bonus! There was an offering of different fruit juices, club soda, and other sodas (e.g. coke).Condition of the room:-	Extremely clean-	Good lighting in the room and in the bathroom-	Large bathroom, and large shower stall -	Excellent soundproofing – we did not hear any noise from the street, and we were two levels above ground floor facing the restaurants-	Beds and pillows very comfortableWe managed well with the size of the room.For breakfast, the hotel offered cakes and pastries (including the custard tarts!), bread, cereals, eggs, sausages, fruit.  We would definitely stay at this hotel again next time we return to Lisbon! Thank you for your hospitality!"
Dec 2017,40,Good choice for central Lisbon,"Well located property. Easy walking distance to main central sights and to public transportation. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Room was spacious, comfortable, and clean. Recommended."
Dec 2017,50,Could not have asked for a better hotel,"Wow, crazy good location, clean, modern, big rooms, staff is absolutely lovely; patient, helpful, knowledgeable, mans desk 24/7. The restaurants on the hotel street are a little annoying, trying to get you to have lunch or dinner and basically harassing you.But it's just by the river, the commercio plaza, 5 minutes from alfama, 5 minutes from barrio alto and near a great shopping mall and passage. I would definitely come back."
Dec 2017,50,One of the best hotels,"This hotel is perfect in every way. From the moment we arrived till check out. Check in was a breeze and we got our room early. We had a room with a little balcony, just prefect with a view of the plaza down the road. The staff is very friendly and give you good directions. They take the time to find closing times to sites, restaurants, etc.  I did not eat at the hotel as there are so many places to try.  The hotel is literally so close to so many attractions, shopping, and plazas. It is so easy to walk everywhere from here. The rooms are great. The size is perfect. There is a small refrigerator with complimentary drinks. Perfect as you can use one after a leisurely walk. The bathroom is of a good size and clean. The last night of my visit - one of the gentleman in the reception went out of his way to find a salsa club for me and recommended a restaurant in that area. Rua da Pimenta is mostly with locals. The food was one of the best in Lisbon and I was able to continue my tradition of dancing the last night with good salsa.  My stay was such a pleasure. Thanks Santa Justa."
Dec 2017,40,Great hotel,"We enjoyed our stay. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and the breakfast had great choice. The location is great, very central and with pedestrian streets all around, so no traffic noise. We were disturbed by some noise from neighbours from the corridor getting up early and from footsteps on the hard floors in the rooms. I would recommend adding another door between the entrance area of the room and the main part of the bedroom and changing the entrance flooring to carpet or adding rugs there and around the beds. I wasn't keen on the bucket shower, as I prefer to have my head out of the water, and it wastes water."
Nov 2017,40,Welcoming Hotel,"Hotel Santa Justa is perfectly located in the centre of Lisbon.  The hotel is in the old town but is very modern, clean, comfortable and contemporary inside, with quality fittings. Reception was very obliging in moving us to another room when it was obvious that the attic room roof was too low for my husband (tip for tall people). We received a generous welcome gift and message both nights we stayed. The only negative is the breakfast/dining/bar area, which we didnt find very inviting. It is straight off reception to begin with and our experience on a Saturday evening when we ordered a drink and listened to some jazz was that no sooner had the band finished at 10:00pm than the bright overhead lights were switched on and the staff started clattering cutlery and crockery as they set the tables for breakfast. This was despite a few people still being there and the bar supposedly open until midnight. Overall though it is a nice hotel and despite being central it was very quiet."
Nov 2017,50,Ideal city hotel in Lisbon,"Ideal location to explore Lisbon. On arrival a very pleasant greeting and the staff couldn't be more helpful. Explained where everything to go to was. Good tips on local restaurants, places to go that didn't cost a fortune. The room was perfect (we were upgraded to a suite) with a luxury bathroom and L'Occitaine toiletries, free mini bar. Nespresso coffee maker (could do with more coffee sachets plz). All nice touches. Wifi that actually works. Excellent... !! Very lazy taking Uber cabs everywhere (even to and from the airport) which are literally on the doorstep. Everything is pretty much within easy walking distance... if we're going back I wouldn't hesitate to come back to this hotel. Thanks for a very pleasant stay indeed"
Nov 2017,40,"Excellent service and location, but bed and pillows are uncomfortable.",Excellent and prompt service by the staffs. Downside is the bed and pillows were uncomfortable (think it is because they are very old and used). Location is great and nearby to all sightseeing attractions.
Nov 2017,50,Vacation and conference trip,"We loved, loved, loved, the hotel, the staff, the location, cleanliness, food in the hotel, and breakfast. Everything!!!! I’d highly recommend this hotel, also if you have a packed schedule, go with the breakfast option, the variety is vast and delicious. We got a welcome drink Port in our room and then parting drink, brut sparkling wine with chocolates, incredibly kind gesture. The hotel is centrally located a block away from the metro, and to all other key attractions. We came back a year later to stay in this neighborhood. This hotel was the best experience we could’ve asked for."
Nov 2017,50,Great location and super staff,Incredibly helpful staff who want to make your stay in their city the best it can be. Great location for exploring Lisbon. Very comfortable room that was quiet at night for relaxing. We loved the touches of welcome port and pastry and last night champagne and chocolates. Will be back the next time I visit Lisbon.
Nov 2017,40,Greatest location,"This hotel in in the CENTER of the old town! Walking distance to most everything, a five euro taxi to most anywhere else! Clean hotel, live music on certain nights in the lounge. The staff was extremely helpful. Highly recommended!"
Nov 2017,50,Excellent small hotel in the centre of Lisbon,"Smiling, attentive reception staff generally indicate a good hotel.  Santa Justa is certainly a good hotel, made better by the staff and well-appointed, comfortable rooms, right where one wants to be in the middle of Lisbon.  The streets around are pedestrian only, so quiet at night but less than one hundred metres from taxis and public transport.We will certainly return and have no hesitation in recommending this excellent small hotel."
Nov 2017,30,Excellent location! and you pay for it.,"Extremely well located, this hotel is central to the metro, the sea, the tram that takes you to Belem, the tram to Alfama etc. It is an easy walk to Alfama, Bairo Alto etc.The staff were friendly enough. Although, many a time they did not acknowledge us as we entered and walked past them. The housekeeping staff were a bit slack...often forgetting to replace coffee capsules.Given the room rate, I did feel they could have been generous by giving us bottles of water daily. We had booked a 6 night stay. And we had not been informed about the construction work in the building opposite our room. It worked out ok in the end."
Nov 2017,40,Centrally based hotel which is worth a visit,"This hotel is located in the centre of Baixa and very close to the Santa Justa Lift.It sits on a pedestrian area but the staff meet your taxi in the nearby square and walk you to it.Reception staff were very good and helpful with information and booking restaurants.The room we had (superior) was large with balconies overlooking the street below. Very comfy beds and shower enough for two!!!!!!!Breakfast provides a wide choice of hot and cold selections, and you would be best to book this in advance and get a discount.The bar is small and have had better service elsewhere. Did not have dinner here as there is such a wide variety available in the area so cannot comment on quality but they do a competitively priced menu.There is some building work not far away but it did not effect us and seems to be nearing an end.Easy walk down to rive4 and plenty of bars cafes and restaurants in neighbourhood.Would recommend as a central place to stay."
Nov 2017,40,October 5-day break,"Good central location minutes from Metro station, very friendly staff, comfortable room with excellent en-suite. Superb wide ranging buffet breakfast. Friends recommended it and we were not disappointed."
Oct 2017,50,Charming,"Charming hotel in a central location.  Modern without being pretentious.  Clean and well equipped.  Friendly and helpful staff.  Excellent breakfast.  Free WiFi.  Convenient for metro, trams, buses and ferries, and for all the central attractions."
Oct 2017,50,Fantastic Hotel,"We spent one week at this wonderful hotel in October, 2017.  The hotel is perfectly located on a pedestrian street in the heart of Lisbon.  It is a VERY easy walk to many shops, restaurants, and public transportation including the wonderful trams just steps away.  The staff is most excellent and helpful.  The room was very spacious with a a very modern bathroom.  The breakfast was perfect in the breakfast room located on the first floor.  We also had dinner one night which was quite good and very economical.  The drinks in the minibar were included with our room and it was replenished daily.  During our visit, we were provided a small bottle of Porto, a large bottle of champagne, and a box of chocolates!"
Oct 2017,50,Excellent hotel in a great location,"The hotel is a 3 minute walk from the Rosssrio metro station and is easy to find sitting opposite the Santa Justa lift,The hotel has a bright fresh boutique feel to it. The receptionist was extremely friendly and helpful on check in and the room was ready when we arrived at 12:00.The room itself is well decorated with sufficient space to store 2 cases and enough room for my wife’s clothes in the wardrobe !The bathroom was a good size and the shower was excellent with a large cubicle and a powerful large headed spray. The hotel has a very friendly and personal feel about, it as demonstrated when upon our return from our evening meal on the first night we were greeted with a couple of pasteis de nata and a small bottle of Porto in our room to thank us for choosing the hotel. It was a very nice gesture and much appreciated.The room also had a free minibar with juice, water and coke and even a beer another nice touch along with a good WiFi connection for no charge.The hotel is ideally located to explore the city on foot, close to popular shopping and dinning areas and the river front. It is also well servers by bus, tram and Metro stops within a few minutes walk. We would not hesitate to return to the hotel or recommend it to friends, thank you to everyone who made our stay in a delightful city so enjoyable."
Oct 2017,50,First class hotel,We really enjoyed our stay here. A friendly warm welcome by staff. Excellent customer service. Rooms clean and of high quality regularly  serviced and comfortable. Welcome gift was most enjoyable. Very highly recommended
Oct 2017,50,Beautiful Lisboa,"We chose this hotel after reading a review on this site.  Upon our arrival at the hotel, which was very early in the morning, the staff went out of their way to ensure our luggage was safely stored and made every accommodation to get us into our room as quickly as possible.  When the staff learned we were celebrating our 50th Wedding Anniversary, they upgraded our room.  That was totally unexpected, but so very much appreciated.  We now look forward to our return to Lisbon in August of 2018 and most assuredly booking another stay. I hope management will convey our sincere appreciation to their outstanding staff for making our stay so memorable."
Oct 2017,50,The perfect stay in Lisbon,"Wonderful hotel in the old town. While the exterior is a typical example of the architecture of the old town, the interior is sleek and modern. Genuinely nice and extremely helpful staff. Very appreciated gestures like the complementary port wine and pastel de nata upon arrival, as well as a bottle of sparkling wine and a personal letter from the general manager on the evening before departure. All in all a wonderful stay."
Oct 2017,50,Excellent location,Stayed 3 days excellent location to old part of city. great friendly staff on reception.Room perfect clean very boutique style.string of restraunts beside hotel and with in 5/min walk.Main high st shopping 5min taxi journey if ya want it?..Totally recommend this for your short stay..
Oct 2017,50,A First Class boutique Hotel,"I organised a group of 50 people to stay in the Santa Justa Hotel and have similarly organised the group over the past 15+ years in various cities across Europe for an annual event.  The Santa Justa Hotel proved to be amongst the best of the many we have stayed in and these have all been 4 star or above.  The location, comfort and service were all first class and I cannot recommend the hotel enough."
Oct 2017,40,Perfect location for exploring Lisbon!,"Really enjoyed my stay here, mostly for the really great location.I thought it was very well priced considering its location and big rooms! Appreciated the lovely welcome in the room with a small bottle of port and some pastéis de nata (they make really great ones at this hotel which they serve at breakfast every morning).Only complaint is that the room could have been cleaned better after the previous guests (especially the bathroom). I mentioned this to the front desk and it was taken care of promptly."
Oct 2017,50,Wonderful location for touring Lisbon,"The hotel staff, rooms, and breakfast are all quite good, and the location is perfect for touring Lisbon. We also enjoyed Fado on Sunday evening.  You can catch the buses to Belem, and walk to the Rossio train station for Sintra.  You are minutes from Santa Justa Elevator and shopping along Rue da Garrett.  Many restaurants to choose from.  You can also walk to the river and Lisbon Se.  For the Moorish Castle, the walk is steep so take a trolley, taxi, or tuk tuk.  Overall, great hotel with superior location."
Oct 2017,50,lovely view and exceptional location/service,"Loved the 3 balcony, bright, clean hotel room with an incredible view; even the bathroom had a walk-out balcony.  The staff were truly amazing.  The bar fridge was completely restocked daily: juice, water, beer, etc. and we received a lovely bottle of port and 2 delicious Portuguese tarts as a welcome upon arrival; truly appreciated.  Would definitely recommend this hotel.  The octopus at dinner was so tasty my husband ordered it again our second night.  Perfect location, in a pedestrian district near Rosso."
Oct 2017,40,Lovely central hotel,"Lovely central hotel in pedestrian area. Friendly, helpful staff. Clean, spacious room with fabulous bathroom. Great restaurants and bars nearby. Very close to shops and river. Would definitely recommend this hotel."
Oct 2017,50,Wonderful experience!,"Very helpful and friendly staff. Wonderful location. Close to the Metro and easy walking to many attractions. Good breakfast selection. Nice perks offered in the room including mini bar, espresso and small bottle of port and dessert at end of stay. Highly recommended."
Oct 2017,50,Friendliest Service,We arrived in Portugal for the first time and we were worried about the language barrier. We arrived army our hotel and we were greeted by the friendliest staff who spoke perfect English. They have helped arrange restaurants and tours and we have had a truly memorable vacation! This hotel is beautiful! Our room is spacious and comfortable. The lighting is great and our bath has a large tub which is incredible after a long day of sightseeing!
Oct 2017,40,Lisbon first visit,"We spent 5 nights at the Hotel Santa Justa.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was modern, clean, spacious, and very comfortable.  The hotel is brilliantly situated for sightseeing and in a vibrant part of the city for restaurants,bars etc We would return."
Oct 2017,50,Weekend break,Great location in centre within walking distance of main tourist sites. Stayed in suite really nice but best part of stay was how helpful and friendly front desk were. Found us restaurants at short notice all good choices even though required a few calls. Reminded us of why you stay in a hotel and not airbnb! Would definitely go back.
Oct 2017,50,Superb,"This lovely hotel, with easy access to many of the major sites, events, and restaurants  of Lisbon, proved to be delightful in every way. We arrived at 6 AM, after an overnight flight, to animated and gracious personnel who made us immediately welcome and were unfailingly helpful throughout our week in Lisbon. The amenities and facilities are attractive and immaculate. The room was silent. Step out the door and Lisbon embraces you. Unless you are looking for something grander than a charming boutique hotel, look no further."
Oct 2017,50,Lisbon2017,"We spent 2 nights at Hotel Santa Justa. Friendly staff and check in was painless. The hotel is very clean and modern. The room is spacious and modern, comfortable bed, and very nice bathroom. Wi-Fi is complimentary so is breakfast. The hotel is located in one of the best areas of Lisbon. Walking distance to a number of sights such as the Santa Justa Elevator, Rossio Square, shopping, and the Lisbon Cathedral. Lots of restaurants in the area. I would stay in this hotel if I decide to visit Lisbon again."
Sep 2017,50,Wonderful location ,"We found this hotel through Booking.com in a reasonable price- 220€ per night. Very helpful and friendly staff. Clean rooms. Large bed. Large shower. Nice welcome with wine and cookies and also a Nesspresso machine. Close to many attractions (see photos attached, like Santa Justa elevator) and shopping areas and to the Metro. We plan to return once more."
Sep 2017,40,Excellent location,"The hotel is in a great location near the centre and the square, with some lovely restaurants just outside the door. The hotel is straightforward, clean and comfortable with pleasant rooms and mainly views of the street below. Although the street it is on is busy, the hotel is very quiet and pleasant. The breakfast is good with a range of choices of food. Occasionally the breakfast service itself could do with an overhaul, with maybe more staff working during the busy time. When all the tables are occupied there is too much work for one member of staff to keep things moving efficiently. However that is a minor point, compared to the general ambience of the hotel. We has a superior room which was large with an excellent shower. Be warned though, the bath itself is somewhat unusual to get in as one has to hike over a 3ft side to get in to it. I think this would be difficult for elderly people.However there is much to applaud in this hotel and we would definitely stay here again"
Sep 2017,50,Good hotel,"We enjoyed our time visiting Lisbon and staying at the Santa Just a Hotel.  Great location (can walk to  great restaurants, shops, tourist sites, churches, etc).  Friendly staff and nice room with a view."
Sep 2017,40,Great Location But A Little Pricey,"We stayed at the Santa Justa Lisboa for 4 nights earlier this month.  We had spent a week traveling within the rest of Portugal.  We returned our rental car in Lisbon - checking in was a little stressful because the hotel is located on a pedestrian-only street.  We had quite a bit luggage and our 4-year-old daughter with us.  The hotel staff was very helpful though once we managed to find the hotel.  The location is great with nearby proximity to Rossio Square, hop-on hope-off buses and trams and many restaurants.  The rooms were pretty large in size - the pillows were very soft though.  I generally prefer harder pillows, but this was a minor thing.  There were plenty of cafes open early in the morning so getting breakfast was not a problem.  If in Lisbon again, I would stay here."
Sep 2017,50,Wonderful,"Beautifully appointed room, hotel is in a perfect place to use as a base, friendly and helpful staff.  Although off the main street, the hotel is quiet.  Had 2 jazz evenings with a live band when we were there and we couldn't hear a thing in our room.  Would love to go again."
Sep 2017,40,Almost Perfect,"The hotel is in an excellent location.  Many of the main sights are within walking distance, and there are stops for public transportation nearby as well. The hotel itself is located off a side street of one of the main pedestrian streets, with lots of options for food, shopping, and sights. The rooms are very quiet, clean, and comfortable. I would say the hotel is almost perfect. The only issue I had was that one of the front desk managers, I think his name was Fabio, was quite rude one morning. I asked him for recommendations for where to get breakfast and he was very curt, like I was bothering him, and he simply told me that I can get breakfast ""anywhere."" Not exactly helpful, and a little insulting. Other than that one encounter, my stay was wonderful."
Sep 2017,50,great location,"Clean, great beds,  quiet, off the main street, great location to walk everywhere. .  Friendly staff and they helped book tours and cabs for us.  Didn't use the breakfast offered.  It was poor value for what you got."
Sep 2017,50,Great Hotel in great location,"Superior room for a four night visit in Lisboa. The staff are super friendly and great service. The rooms are a good size with a massive bathroom. The shower is a rain shower from the ceiling with flashing led lights, Like being in a disco. Ah, ah, ah, ah staying alive!!!!!!"
Sep 2017,40,OUR TRIP TO PORTUGAL LISBON,"I had been to Portugal, Lisbon with my family on 24-08-2017 has stayed 4 nights in Santa Justa Hotel. It was a great stay. The hotel rooms were very good, and it is situated in between one of the main food streets. The Hotel itself has a very good Restaurant and most of the days I had my dinner there with good sea foods etc., The reception staff and all the other staff at the restaurant of the hotel were very good and very approachable and helpful. The Santa Justa Tower is very close just two minutes from the hotel, everything was just walk able distance. We visited the Cathedral, The Saint Anthony Church, were Saint Anthony was born his house were he lived and the surrounding village etc., It was a fabulous trip.  The hotel also arranged a one day trip to Fatima, it was great. Wish to visit once again later sometimes."
Sep 2017,50,Gem in the heart of the Baixa,"Hotel Santa Justa is situated right in the heart of the Baixa, which means that almost everything in Lisbon's Old Town (Alfama, Bairro Alto, Chiado, Baixa) is less than a 15 minute walk. Rossio Station, perfect if you are taking a day trip to Sintra or any other city, is just a few blocks away as well. Despite the hotel being located on a bustling street, our room was very quiet. It had a comfortable king bed, all the amenities you'd need, and great AC. A delicious breakfast buffet can be added for 15 Euro per person or you can grab coffee and a pastry at one of the countless cafes nearby. I loved this place and will recommend to any of my friends traveling to Lisbon!"
Sep 2017,50,Excellent stay in Lisbon~,"We just stayed at Hotel Santa Justa a few days ago and our overall experience was beyond what I expected. We flew in from NYC so we landed early in the AM and they let us check in early with just a minor fee of 30 euros. We were traveling with a toddler so this was so helpful as all of us got to sleep before we explored the city. The location of the hotel is unbeatable as it is only a block away from Rua Augusta and an easy walk to everywhere you need to go. We loved the free minibar and also the space of the room was awesome. We stayed in their suite and it was larger than what I expected with enough storage for a family of 3. One thing to note is that this hotel is centrally located with lots of touristy restaurants around with ppl trying to lure you into their place for lunch/dinner. We were getting tired of saying ""no"" all the time. When we did try one of those places, it was AWFUL. I would stay away from the touristy restaurants and go to local places which I'll write about in a separate review. Overall the hotel was excellent and I would highly recommend it."
Sep 2017,50,John,"A very centrally located hotel with friendly, helpful staff. No large public spaces within hotel but room excellent - comfortable and clean-lined. It was my birthday during our stay and receptionists seem to have noticed this from my passport. I was very pleasantly surprised to return to our room on the day to find a couple of cakes, fruit, a small bottle of cava and a birthday candle awaiting us. Nice detail!"
Aug 2017,50,Excellent Choice,"Visited Lisboa for 3 days and was looking for something special. Came down to Memmo Principal, Luminere or HST. Very happy with the Santa Justa. The staff were outstanding the room lovely and spotless. No noise issues at all despite being next to the lift. The only negative was access to the bath and shower taps. Brilliant rain shower but beware if the selector is in the wrong place!!!Nice little touches like complimentary Pastel de Nata and port. Breakfast was excellent with wide choice of fruit eggs hams pastries etc. Special mention to Ines on reception as being especially helpful and a fantastic interface to guests. Location was ideal for our needs - really central to all transport connections. 10mins from Biarro Alto 7 mins to route 28 tram and seafront 5 mins from Rosario Station. Couldn't fault it really. Thank you"
Aug 2017,50,Great hotel,"Wonderful hotel, great location, staff is very helpful and courteous.  Breakfast is very nice quality with plenty of options, even make your own Mimosa with champagne and fresh squeezed OJ! Rooms are spacious, we got some complimentary Portuguese pastries and a small bottle of Port Wine the first night."
Aug 2017,50,Very pleasant ,"My stay here was very pleasant and the staff were all very welcoming and helpful. The breakfast was not too big but sufficient. The only thing i sort of missed was a hotel bar, but on the other hand you could spend some pleasant time out on the Terasse. The location is superb right next to the elevator and a 2 minute walk from the sea.I would recommend this hotel."
Aug 2017,50,All Around Excellent,"This hotel made our Lisbon vacay a success! Great central location. Mariann at front desk was an asset to hotel: Gave us Lisbon overview on map, made suggestions and Rez for us. Saw her handle difficult patron very professionally and successfully. Everyone at front desk & in restaurant very helpful and cheerful and professional."
Aug 2017,50,Fantastic hotel to stay .,One of the most welcoming hotel that we have stayed at . Extremely conveniently located and very friendly staff . Do not forget to have a Whit Sangria made by either Diana or Tania . Simply out of this world . Very clean and well run hotel and the staff really make all the difference as they are very friendly and attentive . Delicious  breakfast . Will most definitely  tell all my friends to stay at Santa Justa.
Aug 2017,50,An excellent choice,"Location is perfect. It's just a short walk to everywhere of note. We were received by Marianna at reception. This young lady was as charming and helpful as you could possibly imagine. The room was fine, not lavish but clean and comfortable. Robes and slippers were provided. The complimentary bottle of port very well received and the free mini bar was a nice touch. The shower room was amazing. Breakfast was a little limited but adequate. Should add that every member of reception staff was extremely helpful. Great, great hotel. Definitely will stay there again."
Aug 2017,50,Good choice in central city,"Modern, well run.  Rooms were small but functional.  Decent breakfast.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Wifi good enough to stream video.  Great location, in the middle of Baixa, easy walk to most everything."
Aug 2017,50,Fantastic Location,"Great stay at Santa Justa. Location can't be beat everything in Baixa within walking distance, front desk staff was super helpful and rooms comfortable! Will stay here again in a heartbeat if we ever come back!"
Jul 2017,50,Great location and excellent service,"This hotel is close to many of the sights in the Baixa - it was walking distance to everything.  Their restaurant is great and especially breakfast, which is included, is a feast.  All of the staff were so friendly and helpful.  We had a wonderful experience staying there for 3 nights."
Jul 2017,50,"perfect, excellent situation, Just a good experience","we went , tired, late afternoon, the Hotel is in the best location of Lisboa. Nice room, lobby ok, breakfast location excellent, with a large variety of fresh food, fruits end beverages. From here itvs possible to visite Lisboa very easily, with best advices from nice receptionists. A nice and pleasant experience."
Jul 2017,50,Two nights in Lisbon,"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATIONBrilliant location, right in the middle of the Old City. The room was big and very well decorated. Loved the personal touch - found a small bottle of Port and two egg tarts on the table with a nice welcome card. The hotel is right between the two elevators - one that goes to Alfama and one that is used as a tourist attraction. Even that the hotel is on a very busy pedestrian street and we were on the first floor it was quiet in the room. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel - lots of options around it. we didn't use any public transportation while in the hotel and when we left the city we used UBER."
Jul 2017,40,Room are very nice and well equipped. Staff is very gentle and helpful.,"Very well located hotel in the center of Lisbon, walking distance from old Lisbon and from the castle. Room are very nice and well equipped. Staff is very gentle and helpful. Breakfast is excellent. The hotel is nevertheless not cheap. The room we had (6th floor) under the roof offered a quite nice view (which is probably not the case of the room underneath). It was not very large, impression strengthened by the low ceiling for a significant part of the room."
Jul 2017,40,"Excellent location, good food and pleasant and helpful staff.","Hotel Santa Justa is perfectly placed in the centre of Lisbon, a short walk from Rossio metro station. The hotel is modern, clean and tidy, and the staff are very helpful and friendly. The food in the restaurant is also excellent. Overall, I would stay here again and certainly would recommend it to anyone else travelling to Lisbon for a few days."
Jul 2017,40,City Center Hotel,"Hotel Santa Justa is it central part of charming Baixa  Lisboa.  Everything within walking distance. Close to Metro and bus tours.The staff are very welcoming and helpful,they also have a really VERY GOOD  restaurant with great food ."
Jul 2017,30,"Great location, average value for money","In general I would say he Santa Justa is a nice hotel, if I had paid €150 a night I would probably have given it a higher score. But I paid c€220 a night and for that sort of money I would have expected more from a 4 star hotel.On the plus side it is a great location, right in the heart of the old city and all the main attractions and restaurants are walkable. It was a clean hotel and he staff were very friendly and helpful with one exception (see below). The restaurant at the hotel was very good, a small menu but a good selection, we tried it on the first night when we were tired, we went on to eat there three times. These was also a free mini bar with water, juice, cokes and a beer, a nice gesture, though I would have preferred more than two netpresso capsules (seems quite common to offer netpresso now, but then only offer two capsules, surely no great cost to offer more)We had a room on the sixth floor. This is in the eves and resulted in a strange shaped bathroom, the sink was in the slope section of the roof and had very little head space and virtually no shelf space for placing wash bags etc. In fact these had to be placed on a low level shelf away from the sink and easy access.  On top of this, the sink had a crack (see photos). Maybe these things sound petty, but these are the things that make a 4 star hotel justify higher prices. My advice would be to ask for a floor below 6 where other reviews talk about small balconies. One other small problem, and maybe we were just unlucky. We returned to the hotel at 3.45pm one afternoon and my wife felt unwell only to find room hadn't been cleaned and the cleaner was just about to arrive. When I complained at the desk, the shift manager was rather rude and defensive, saying it's not unusual for rooms not to be made up till late when they were busy, and that I should have put 'the please make my room sign' out. No apology. I have stayed at a lot of nice hotels around the world, and have never found my room un maid at 3.45, and have only ever used the sign for 'do not disturb' Though it was more his attitude which was 'you are wrong and I am right'.Having said all of that, if you can get a good deal and a room on a lower floor, it's a good place to stay. All of the other staff were very pleasant and helpful, the restaurant and its food and staff were excellent and the location is fantastic. It is not a €200 a night hotel but for €150 you will be happy."
Jul 2017,40,"Great Service, Great Hotel, Very Central",Very nice hotel.  In a perfect spot in the central part of charming Lisboa.  Everything within walking distance.  Hotel staff very prompt and accommodating.  Terrific breakfast buffet made it a nice way to start each day.  Rooms nice but a bit small.  Overall would highly recommend and would stay there again without hesitation.  5 star service and quality.
Jul 2017,50,Perfect base for sightseeing,"Friendly hotel in an excellent location for seeing the city, close to Metro and the hop-on-hop-off tour routes as well as many restaurants and the riverfront. The front desk staff were very helpful in giving advice and directions."
Jul 2017,50,Fantastic ,We've been to Lisbon many times and while there are endless places to eat many are average. Many more are full of tourists getting the standard menu. We walked past here on a baking hot day and popped in for a drink. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The drink turned into lunch and we were so happy it did. The food is top quality as is the service. A beautiful place to eat in the hub of the center but still away from the crowds. We've been back several times and it never disappoints.
Jul 2017,50,Excellent Stay at Hotel Santa Justa,My wife and I recently stayed at Hotel Santa Justa Lisboa as part of our honeymoon trip.  We had an excellent stay here.  The room was clean and modern and the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  Thank you Hotel Santa Justa!
Jul 2017,50,Small details make the difference,"Hit all of this 50+ year old solo female traveler's ""best of's"" . . Ideal location (mass transit, the river, great restaurants and city sights); friendly, welcoming staff; chic, spacious, clean, quiet room and fantastic marble bath with sybaritic shower, lighted magnifying makeup mirror, plenty of counter space and discreet, in-shower hanging line for hand wash. Requested and received in-room tea kettle (Nespresso provided), water in mini-bar. Only reason it's not 5-star is it's not a full-on, over the top luxury experience but after daily 7-mile hikes and day trips to Sintra and Cascais, it felt extremely luxurious to return ""home"". Note: Uber or taxi must drop you a few blocks away as this is a pedestrian street. and Uber best bet from/to airport, IMHO.Restaurant staff extremely kind as well."
Jun 2017,50,Great city hotel,"We stayed here for 4 nights whilst visiting Lisbon. The hotels location is perfect for exploring the sites. It's close to all the main squares, metro and bus tours.The reception staff are very welcoming and helpful.We wanted to see Aerosmith whilst we were in Lisbon and they arranged tickets for us, even printing the tickets.Rooms are small but typical of city hotels. If I was being picky it lacked space to put away some of our clothes so we had to leave some in the suitcase. But overall the rooms are very clean and comfortable.I'm always impressed by a magnifying mirror in the bathroom which our room had...yeay!There was a good choice at breakfast and again the staff were very friendly and polite.Would definitely recommend."
Jun 2017,50,Great hotel ,"We stayed here a week in June. Was really impressed with the rooms and the staff of the hotel. The rooms were Nice and clean. Our room was big and the bathroom was amazing. Really impressed by everything, they also have a really Nice restaurant with great food and drinks. Would stay here again."
Jun 2017,50,Excellent hotel!!!,"Hotel Santa Justa is in a great walking location. Despite being in a very busy location, the rooms are quiet and very soundproof. The staff are friendly and courteous. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone."
Jun 2017,50,Wedding,"At our daughter's wedding we got the most amazing food, the waiters were the best you can imagine, and we got so much food and wine that we probably could have had the double number of guests. We are so glad we chose this place to celebrate 😃"
Jun 2017,50,Peace and Tranquility,"This is a very nice hotel in a very busy part of the old town of Lisbon.  The street outside of the entrance is pedestrianised for most of the day/night, deliveries only til about 1000 I think.  After that it's a busy thoroughfare from Rossia Square towards the coast.  Noisy you may think, but our room was on the first floor, almost over the main door, but as there was no need to open any window due to the excellent aircon we heard nothing during the night.  Beds very comfy, and massive, perfect nights sleep.We had dinner one night, lunch one day, and breakfast every day - couldn't fault any meal.  Nice selection of fruit, meats/cheese/salad, bacon/eggs, toast and stickies.  They major on coffee here.  Rooms have nespresso coffee machines, so no cup of tea at the end of the day.  Would especially recommend the scallops and orange salad on the lunch menu, full marks for that.Our room was plenty big enough, very clean and well equipped with toiletries, altho there was no hair conditioner, only shampoo, and my hair really missed that with the very hot temperatures we hadThe staff were great.  All spoke English, were very polite, friendly and helpful, couldn't have done more.Why would you have weighing scales in the bathroom?  I never stepped on them!I would return."
Jun 2017,50,Ideal hotel,"We stayed in this hotel at the beginning of June 2017. I loved it. It is centrally located, literally within walking distance from all the good stuff. I like old buildings that have been converted into contemporary use and this is a fine example. The room was spotless. I found the front desk staff useful and informed . A reviewer wrote that there are tourist targeted restaurants lining the street and this is definitely true, but I found the waiters easy to dodge. There seem to be many old buildings in this area of Lisbon that are being renovated and the Santa Justa a has one opposite, which created quite a bit of noise. Interestingly, our room faced the building and when we closed the sound proof windows the noise was cancelled. Anyway, this is obviously just a temporary nuisance and out of the control of the hotel. Nevertheless, they were apologetic about it .The only minor issue that we had was that the air conditioner did not seem to be powerful enough, particularly when we compared it with the one in my in laws' room down the hall (our room was bigger, which might have had something to do with it)."
Jun 2017,50,Great Stay,"We stayed three days in a Santa Justa Suite.  Very nice room, big, clean and quite.  Hotel is located on a busy pedestrian street but the room is very quite.  It is a great location to walk to shops and restaurants.  Staff is very helpful.  One of the best places in Old Town Lisbon."
Jun 2017,30,average hotel in central location,This hotel is very tired and seen its better days.  The a/c and the wifi were spotty.  The bar downstairs was horrible. The only redeeming thing about the hotel is the location. Very central.  The front desk staff was not helpful with local recommendations. The desk charged my an extra 25 or 30 euros to get in my room a few hours early after a transatlantic flight even though my room was empty and available.  Not a high class hotel.  You can do better.
Jun 2017,40,Good hotel which met all our criteria for our city break!,"Reception staff welcoming and very helpful.Location near all transport and a short amble to the river. Amongst a huge choice of eating places.Lovely gesture of complimentary port and free mini bar.Rooms clean and spacious. Bathroom was large & clean with great shower.Breakfast was adequate - choice of cereals, fruit, continental & pastries etc. but hot breakfast could be a tad disappointing for some."
Jun 2017,30,"Fine, but definitely not great","Chose this hotel because it seemed like a higher end property with a good, quiet location. Unfortunately, it was a letdown on all of these fronts and I regretted choosing this hotel.The hotel is fine. The room is spacious, but the use and design of it is so poor it ends up feeling small. There is a huge desk with a large chair that does not push flush under the desk which takes up space, a hanging light fixture that takes up a ton of space, and a bistro table and chair -- all of which combined eat up half the room. Huge bathroom, but basically no drawers or storage of any kind in the room itself.The room is not super quiet. We had to run AC at full blast in the night to create ambient noise to block out the street below. The street below features a whole block of tourist restaurants with people approaching you trying to get you to eat there. Each time you come and go from your hotel you will have to dodge them. The location is just OK. It is walkable to many other areas, but not great. You can do better.Wifi works well."
Jun 2017,50,Perfect location!,"Had a wonderful stay at Hotel Santa Justa! Perfect location in a pedestrian street, complimentary minibar (amazing after a long day of sightseeing), and a beautiful room with a balcony! The only thing dragging it a bit down, was the annoying restaurant neighbours literally following us to the hotel door! Other than that, we had an amazing stay, would defidently recommend choosing this hotel!"
Jun 2017,40,Made to feel special ,"Arrived at the hotel today for family weekend of birthday and anniversary celebrations.  We mentioned the celebrations at reception and came back to our room after sight seeing to find this in our room, how special it made us feel 💝.  Staff are really friendly and helpful and the hotel is centrally located,  looking forward to the rest of the weekend and enjoying this great hotel"
Jun 2017,50,Three nights in Lisbon,"I have to say, I was more than happy we chose this hotel. The central location is fantastic with easy access to everything. The room was quite large and contained a Nespresso coffee machine and a huge bed and the bathroom was also a perfect size with a wonderful rainforest shower. There were also some beers in the fridge when we arrived, which was an added bonus. The weather was horrendous for 2 out of the 3 days, as it was wintertime, so we spent a lot of time in the hotel, and were therefore extremely content that we had picked such a sweet hotel. The breakfast was delicious with ample choice and fresh water and freshly squeezed juice could always be found in the lounge area, as well as Nespresso coffee machines. Upon my return, I recommended this hotel immediately to a friend who was going to Lisbon a month later and she stayed there and loved it too. I would go back, only perhaps not in December so there is less chance of rain :-)"
Jun 2017,50,One night in Lisbon,The hotel location is excellent and walking distance from many sites.  The staff was very friendly.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  We were lucky to be a night they were having a Fado presentation.
Jun 2017,40,Great location,"We stayed here for two nights following a recommendation from a friend. Staff were very friendly and the room was well proportioned with a good size bathroom. We had port and custard tarts on arrival which was great.The best thing about the hotel is the location which is right in the centre of Lisbon and everywhere is walkable. We didn't eat at the hotel as there were plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby, although the food looked good.This hotel is a great choice for a city break as everything is so convenient and it makes a good base."
Jun 2017,50,City break to Lisbon,"4 days visiting Lisbon with my 12 yo daughter and husband we decided to book Hotel Santa Justa because it was in the centre of the old town in a refurbished old building . We were very happy with the hotel, the staff took care of us and couldn't fault it. From the booking time to the day we left we felt secure and pampered and we'll cared. The room was generous with plenty of storage and nice clean modern design . The shower was lovely and towels good quality. Juliette balcony to the entire length of the room which was nice. You couldn't sleep with the open windows because of the noise coming from outside but once you close the windows and put the air conditioning on it was fine. Air conditioning was very good because it has  one setting they is for how fierce you want it to be (low, medium and high and automatic) then the round button to further set the perfect temperature and set it as high or as low as you want for each of the setting, also is blowing towards the windows and not directly on the bed which means that you can have it on low setting all night.  The instructions for air conditioning are on the same trifold where the TV channels are listed. TV channels are various and you have BBC entertainment as well as fox and the obvious BBC news. Also most of the movies on the Portuguese channels are subtitled not dubbed so you have plenty of choice. Bed is firm and comfortable. Pillows matter of preference but I couldn't get on with them. Lovely little touches in the room when we arrived from bath robes and slippers for adults and a little pouch from Occitane with lip gloss (which my daughter appreciate it as she forgot hers home and the sun burned her lips), some pillow lavender spray and small hand cream in a lovely pouch. We also had as a welcome a small little bottle of port waiting for us with lovely Portuguese tarts. On my daughter bed was waiting a small lovely children toiletry bag. And the obvious small chocolates.Fridge - with mini bar replenished daily and free which was lovely as we didn't need to remember to buy water every day to for the night. It had water still and fizzy, and soft drinks like Coca Cola , Coke Zero, sprite, Fanta , orange juice and beer. Nesspreso machine in the room. I didn't noticed any kettle ...Breakfast - very nice and plenty of choices : Salmon , sausages, eggs all types, ham a few types, the lovely soft Spanish cheese and Brie and a few other kinds , then you had a table with drinks, sparkly wine , fresh orange and apple juice, some more I haven't noticed and then you have some hamon and various patisseries croissants and Portuguese sweet tarts. All in all very nice breakfast to set you on the day. The restaurant is really nice we had dinner one night in the hotel and the food was lovely. Reception - very good all staff was friendly spoke perfect English and couldn't be more helpful and polite. They show you where and how is the best way to get anywhere , also we have been provided with a map of the centre. Very good ....Hotel location - couldn't be better. You are within walking distance from the best piazzas and lovely churches. In the middle of an array of lovely restaurants. People with menus  are trying to stop you and invite you to eat in their restaurants all the time which is annoying after a while. Once  you are out from the hotel be careful because I noticed one evening pickpocketers operating in the area. No different than any big capital city. However police is everywhere we didn't had on us more than what we believe we could spend on the day in cash and a card. In summary we had a great time and wanted  to thank the hotel Santa Justa for taking care of us."
May 2017,50,Great hotel and perfect location,"The location of the hotel is perfect for those who want get around Lisbon on foot or on public transportation.  Our room was about four floors up and that was just about perfect.  We could see and hear the cafes in the street, but they did not want us to close the windows.  The room was comfortable and as you would expect in a four star hotel.  Breakfast was very nicely done in every way."
May 2017,30,Comfortable Stay,"I stayed at Santa Justa for one night. The room was small, but typical of European hotels. I did not appreciate having to pay 60 Euro to check in a few hours early even though our room was ready, but my mom felt compelled because she was traveling with a work laptop. The room did not include wash cloths, only one ""bath sponge"", which was not enough for two people. The room also did not include a hair dryer. But the decor and comfort of the room was very average. It was a bit hard to find given the multiple small streets around the area and fact that it is pedestrian only during the day and most of the night. It is in a great location though!"
May 2017,40,The very centre of Lisbon,"This hotel is literally right about in the centre of the central area (Baixa - pronounced By-sha). It is at the corner of streets that are pedestrian only from 10:30 in the morning. Which means that if you arrive after that time you will have to be dropped some distance away and walk in - so don't forget your map of Lisbon!The hotel has a restaurant, but it is only one of eight or nine in the same street, all of which have tables outside and all of which are fronted by touts regaling you with photo menus. These guys can be quite insistent, so be prepared for that. The hotel has a modern feel and is clean and comfortable. The room we had was large and had all the stuff you need, including a view over the street of restaurants, which can be quite an entertaining site. The only issue was working out how to operate the air conditioning which was solved by a process of just pressing everything until it seemed to get the idea! Once we had worked it out it kept the room at a good temperature throughout our stay.The staff were polite, fluent English speakers (just as well as we don't speak a word of portuguese!), and helpful. The breakfast is good, if a little expensive, but there is plenty of choice and you can, of course, eat as much as you like.The bar and restaurant are a bit utilitarian but they liven it up a couple of evenings a week with live local music. I can't comment on the restaurant as we did not eat there - there is plenty of choice in the city - but the menu looks fine.The thing that can't be bettered though is the location. You are right in the heart of the city and within 15 minutes walk, or tram ride, or bus ride, from pretty much all of the main places you are likely to want to visit. I would not say that it is an inexpensive hotel and for the fitness fanatics there is no gym or pool. However, it is competitive with other hotels we researched on the web. Lisbon is not, I would say, a particularly inexpensive destination. Prices of most things are comparable with the London venues with which I am familiar.Overall, we had a pleasant, comfortable stay for our first visit to Lisbon and should we go back, we might well return to Hotel Santa Justa."
May 2017,50,Amazing will come back ,We stayed for 2 nights and had an amazing time. The hotel was refurbished 4 years ago and was beautiful inside and out. The exceptional staff helped us every step of the way and the food was to die for. Will be coming back...
May 2017,40,Excellent Location and friendly staff,"This hotel has the following Pros- Excellent location next to main tourist attractions- Comfortable beds- Quiet air-conditioning- Windows that provide excellent noise isolation from the v. noisy street- V. Good breakfast- V. friendly staff- Complimentary mini bar and coffee machineCons- The hotel charges your credit card upfront on check in regardless of your reservation type- Very little space in the room for clothes and luggage-  the creative design of the bathroom door, which serves at the same time as closet door that is inconvenient for use if more than one person is sharing the room."
May 2017,50,Just brilliant ,We had to move from one hotel which had mixed up our booking and were able to get a room at Hotel Santa Justa. The lovely lady on reception Mariana could see that we were quite stressed out and immediately upgraded our room. A. I've touch! The hotel is superb with great amenities. I wouldn't hesitate in booking it again. Thanks Mariana.
May 2017,50,Beautiful room. Perfect location,"We stayed here on our 4 night visit to Lisbon. It's in an ideal location. We had a suite and it was roomy, clean, free daily stocking of fridge, bath had a jacuzzi mode, good selection of shampoos and lotions. Bed was massive and comfortable. Staff were helpful and frankly it was a good choice. It was also our anniversary and we were left bubbly, port and cake in our room. Wonderful touch"
May 2017,50,Very convenient in all respects,"In the heart of Lisbon, well renovated modern rooms with very smiling, helpful staff, and clean rooms with all necessary amenities and a modest free mini-bar; I think this is one of the best value for Money establishments in Lisbon."
May 2017,40,Excellent location with wonderful service & food,"Stayed here on a few occasions when in Lisbon on business. Location is excellent, booking process very friendly & the hotel is spotless. nothing is too much trouble.Never dined here before, but after a meeting last Thursday night decided to give it a try. Excellent choice of wine to go with superb food. I have to compliment the young waitress who was so polite, helpful & made the whole experience one to remember. Looking to my next trip to Lisbon."
May 2017,40,Downtown Lisbola,"The hotel has a great location if you want to be in the middle of street restaurants and pedestrian traffic. Front desk staff was first class, helpful and pleasant. The area surrounding the hotel is under renovation with the accompanying noise, don't plan on a quiet afternoon nap. Room was big and comfortable. The only negative being the high tech bathtub/shower is difficult to enter and get out.  Not senior friendly and could be a hazard. Good visit but next time we will go for a quieter setting."
May 2017,50,Just fantastic,"Overall just a fantastic hotel. Very convenient, short walk from Rosso metro. Beautiful restful decor. Spotlessly clean everywhere. Very helpful friendly staff.The room was large for a city hotel and very quiet despite street setting . Curtains good at keeping the light out and very comfortable bed so great for sleeping. Great bathroom with fantastic shower.Lots of nice touches like the cool drinks in the complimentary mini bar, tea and coffee with pastries in the lounge in the afternoon .Breakfast was self serve but with everything anyone could want.We had dinner on a night when they had a Fado group which was a nice experience. The staff and the service were excellent with a special mention to Artur whose energy , charm and linguistic skills were a joy to watch. The food was just ""ok "" however, with servings being a bit too large and a bit too salty for our taste. This was the only area where I think there was room for improvement. Everything else was really just perfect and I would love to go back and wouldn't hesitate to recommend."
May 2017,50,Excellent value for a wonderful hotel,"Hotel Santa Justa is centrally located in the historic district of Lisbon.  The hotel has been recently renovated so the interior is a modern hotel with plenty of amenities, in a picturesque and historically appropriate building. The staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful in recommending local restaurants.  Since it's in a busy district, the streets can be loud with tourists and truck deliveries (during early morning hours and late night hours as the area around the hotel is pedestrian-only from late morning to early evening). However, the rooms were extremely quiet thanks to very thick and well- insulated windows.  If you wanted to hear the local chatter, simply open your window.  From the hotel, we walked to all of the different Lisbon neighborhoods.  The hotel is also family-friendly.  Upon arrival in our room, there was a bag for our son with personal toiletries, and colored pencils and paper. The hotel placed a roll-a-way bed in our room for our son. They also responded promptly to emails we sent prior to the trip requesting additional information.    We would return to Hotel Santa Justa."
May 2017,50,"Great Place, great locations","Hotel Santa Justa is only 4 years old, but the experience the staff have with the guest are amazing.I stay with my family in a very very nice suite with balcony and great jacuzzi.The hotel is small, no many rooms, so the treatment they give you is very personal.The lotations is great, it´s right by the Santa Justa Elevator, very central to go any where.Dinning at their restaurant is a quite experience, the cheff is very good and was where I had my best octupussy.Luis at the desk is very kind and courteous with guests"
May 2017,50,Excellent Hotel,"Pros: Location in downtown Lisbon on pedestrian street near Santa Just Lift.  Modern hotel, quiet, nice rooms/baths.  Staff was friendly and very helpful.  Restaurant had seating inside and out.  I would recommend this hotel any day."
May 2017,50,"Good hotel staff very good hotel central, room was perfect great shower","Great hotel staff friendly and helpful hotel very central room lovely shower great would use again recommended excursions, also advised us re public transport and how to get around fade night at hotel was good"
Apr 2017,40,Excellent hotel in heart of Lisbon,"We arrived after an overnight flight from the U.S.and checked into this hotel just around the corner from Rossio Square in the heart of Lisbon. The hotel was very helpful with our arrangements, from ensuring we had the right type of room to accommodate our family, and arranging for transportation from the airport. We had a suite that was ample in size. The soundproofing was very good as there was construction occurring across the street. Breakfast consisted of a good selection of fruits, breads, eggs, meats, pastries, etc. really anything you would want. Since the location is in the center it was easy to get to many of the main sites of Lisbon as well as using the public transport to get to other places. Definitely would recommend this hotel."
Apr 2017,50,Great modern hotel in heart of Lisbon ,We stayed for a short visit to this lovely hotel in the centre of old Lisbon.    The hotel is beautiful.   Very modern.   The room was excellent.   The bed was very comfortable.    The breakfast was very good.   The staff were very friendly and helpful.   We dined in the restaurant one evening and that was very good.   The location is great right by the harbour and close to transportation to get around the city.
Apr 2017,50,Best 4 star hotel I have ever stayed at,"Hotel Santa Justa is located right in the central area of Lisbon; everywhere is close by and possibly to arrive by foot. It only takes minutes to walk to Rossio station or Prada de Commercial. Yes the hotel is located on a pedestrian street and taxi cannot park directly in front of the hotel, but it’s only an one minute walk if you parked on the next street or near the station. It is not located on the main pedestrian street, so you don’t hear that much noise from the crowd, but I am not sure if it’s because of that, restaurants on this street are super aggressive to have you dine with them. It is quite stressful every time we were entering and leaving the hotel any time after early morning, but it’s not really the hotel’s fault. The hotel has a small entrance right next to their own restaurant (no the aggressive touters are not from their restaurant but from their neighbors), and like many people mentioned, doesn’t really have a big lobby area, but all the front desk people we’ve met were super friendly and helpful. When we entered the room we were greeted with a bottle of Porto wine and delicious Portuguese egg tarts. The rooms are modernly decorated, with doors opened by sensor keys, high ceilings, and a balcony. I didn’t even realized there’s a balcony until I opened the curtains the next day, and there’s a luggage rack in the small balcony area. However, the building across the street is having constructions right now so not much view. I also have not heard any noise coming from the construction either. The windows must block noise from outside pretty well, but walls are thin because sometimes I can hear indistinct chatters from the next room. Great size bathroom with rainfall style shower, you can control the blinds in the shower  for natural light or close it for privacy. There is a nespresso machine and 2 free daily capsules, minibar is also free with generous selections of water, cola, beer, etc. and is refilled daily. I must say I love that the hotel makes the minibar free, save you the time and money from buying drinks; this is my favorite thing of the stay. This hotel really treats you well, and it’s rare for a hotel to not try to nickel and dime you for everything. Beds are comfortable and linens are fresh and great quality. The only tiny issued I hope can be improved was that there’s no lock on the bathroom, bathroom sliding door doubles as a closet door and can hit people if you didn’t coordinate coming in and out of the bathroom, and not enough desk space.I would definitely come back to this hotel again for the great staff, great location, great rooms, and the minibar."
Apr 2017,50,Fantastic hotel,"The location is perfect, right in the middle of everything. You can walk to all the major attractions and it's a short cab ride to Belem. The staff is really great and the hotel rooms are very large, really modern and the beds are comfortable. I highly recommend staying here is you're visiting Lisbon"
Apr 2017,50,Sant just a must try,"This hotel us fantastic, the staff are very friendly & all go out of their way to help you, to book you a taxi or recommend a restaurant.Their food is amazing, bedrooms are a very decent size and equipped with all you need.Smack bang in the centre and close to many main sites.House keeping dine everyday & your just around the corner from the high view Santa justa & the arch.I would definitely go back & most definitely recommend you to book this hotel."
Apr 2017,50,Recommend - ideal hotel for visit to Lisbon,"We stayed 4 nights on the 4th April and had a lovely experience.  The hotel is in a great location, the staff are extremely helpful and friendly.  We were upgraded on arrival and the room and amenities were excellent.  Would definitely stay here again when visiting Lisbon."
Apr 2017,50,excellent experience,"excellent quality, design is great, service is excellent, location is perfect. Definitely will be back. The decor is actual and well done, the room was great and of a fare size, bathroom is excellent."
Apr 2017,40,neighborhood hotel,"good location downtown in the middle of everything. however, no one explained the parking or baggage situation. the hotel cannot be seen from the street . between 10am & 10pm, the street in closed to cars or taxis. you have walk a minimum of two blocks over cobble stones with your bags to get to the hotel."
Apr 2017,30,"Great location, great value!","We had a great 7 day stay at this hotel.  Great location and a great value for the size of the room - our suite was large for European standards!  Front desk was always ready to help, room was very clean and the service in the cafe was great.  I would stay here again."
Apr 2017,50,lovely boutique hotel,"We had a lovely stay at the Hotel Santa Justa for our first stay in Lisbon. I traveled with my son on his spring break - we had a super comfy room with 2 beds.  great linens, well appointed bathroom, great shower, super quiet room. The front desk folks were super helpful assisting us with itinerary plans and dinner reservations.  The real topper was the surprise the hotel provided for my son's 21st birthday - a lovely chilled bottle of cava and a nice little dessert - so thoughtful!  The location was perfect for walking everywhere.  You can't go wrong with Hotel Santa Justa."
Apr 2017,50,Easter break with family,"Lovely hotel, - excellent central location, helpful, friendly staff, lovely rooms to come back to after a day's exploring. Good breakfast with wide selection, evening meal had in the hotel restaurant was excellent and great value."
Apr 2017,40,Very good,Good hotel in the city center. We booked a double room without breakfast as there are a lot of bakeries close by. Don't eat in the restaurants of the hotel street - only tourist traps and way overpriced. You can find amazing restaurants in Bairro Alto.
Apr 2017,50,Perfect location,"Great hotel in the heart of Baixa, just a short walk from Figueira Square where the number 12 and 15 trams terminate, and a slightly longer walk to the river.  And it's right opposite the Santa Justa elevator.  The rooms are very comfortable, the double glazing keeps out the noise from the many restaurants lining the street and the bathrooms are elegant with rain forest showers.  The mini bar is free and restocked daily.  The staff are great and really helpful in suggesting and arranging trips.  A perfect holiday."
Apr 2017,50,Excellent Location will be back,Perfect location for exploring Lisbon. Right in the center of the old town. Beside metro and tram lines so simple to get around. Desk staff were exceptionally courteous and helpful. Food excellent and reasonably priced. Service by all staff very helpful. I had a minor issue with electrical power in my room and once I reported my problem to the reception I was immediately upgraded to a superior room. I would highly recommend this hotel. Very easy from airport to hotel via Metro. 25 Minutes approx. Metro day rambler ticket for € 6.15 covers your trip plus all trams and buses around the city!!
Apr 2017,50,Amazing service and restaurant,"I went to have lunch with my mother and we received a super good service, the waiter, Antonio, was nice and very correct.  We ordered octupus, which was incredibly good and cooked at its point. I strongly recommend it."
Apr 2017,50,Fantastic hotel with great location ,Hotel is brilliantly located on a side street yet very central. Quiet inside once windows are shut despite being noisy on the street. Good choice of breakfast buffet. Family room was great (two interlinked rooms) and service was great from everyone at the hotel. Very family friendly.
Apr 2017,50,Warmest welcome on my second visit,"It's great to find a great new hotel but it is even better to go back to a loved hotel and find it is still superb.  I have been to Lisbon @ five times.  I have stayed here once before and returned for two nights recently.  I received the warmest welcome ever.  My daughter and I were upgraded to a suite!  That never happens to me but the gentleman on the desk said it was because I had been before.  The room was large and over looking the street but with curtains blocking out the light at night.  The bed (king size) had fabulous linens on it and two pillows each (more if needed).  The bathroom was large with nice shampoo, etc and we also received a box of L'Occitane goodies including lavender sleeping spray for the pillow.  I must say we slept well and the room was absolutely quiet despite overlooking a street with restaurants on it and being on the first floor.  I really hate street noise when I am trying to sleep and this was perfect.  Plus the room is super clean and the mini bar is free (yes I said free).  We also came in an found a lovely piece of cake and a small bottle of port as a treat.  Woo hoo.  The location is perfect in the Baixa district.  Easy to get to and close to so many attractions.  The metro stop Rossio is a short walk and it is only Euro 1.46 from the airport (unbelievable isn't it).  Did I mention free wifi? Room safe?We had booked the breakfast one day (special rate) and it was great.  Loads of fresh fruit cut up with Portuguese breads, etc.  Rally delicious.  I really cannot commend this hotel more.  Book it and you will not regret it.  On top of this great hotel are the friendly helpful staff.  Really can't do enough for you. Thank you."
Apr 2017,50,FANTASTIC HOTEL,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a brilliant time. The hotel is in a fantastic location, so close to the metro, castle, shopping areas and the river. The superior room we stayed in was lovely, the biggest bed I've ever seen was very comfortable. L'Occitane products in the beautiful bathroom were a nice touch, even lip balm and lavender pillow mist.Breakfasts were very nice, excellent choice of fresh fruits and small pastries as well as cereals, hot food and hams/cheeses etc.The staff were just so lovely, they made the trip even better. Upon checking in, we were given a street map and the receptionist circled and wrote on specific info such as where to catch the trams, number of the trams going to particular places. They were always friendly, and nothing was ever too much trouble."
Apr 2017,50,Even better than last time,"I love this hotel for its modern yet warm atmosphere.  The rooms & beds are very comfortable and the bathroom very nice (I particularly love the rainshower and the spotless marble floor and walls).  The layout for the breakfast buffet has improved since my stay in 2015 with easily accessible racks for bread and Danish pastries, a redesigned area for fruit juice, jams, butter etc.  There is a large choice of foods.  Staff are extremely friendly, helpful and efficient (they already were in 2015 !)"
Apr 2017,50,Lunch Surprise,"Stopped for a quick lunch in the shade on a sunny day.  We had the best meal we have eaten for a very, very long time...anywhere. The service from our waiter, Jacir, was excellent - friendly and professional. We shared two starters and a main, which with the provided bread, tapenade, oil and balsamic, herbed butter and cheese was more than we needed for lunch. The mixed meat platter was very nice, the garlic baby cuttlefish superb and the prawn and mushroom risotto divine.  Highly recommended."
Mar 2017,50,Great location; helpful staff,"Located near the Santa Justa lift. Many sights nearby. The desk personnel were very helpful with check inn. The street is lined with restaurants. It is a pedestrian walkway. Cabs can pick up in front before 11 AM. Otherwise a on block walk to all manner of  transportation. The room was very clean and pleasant. We at at the hotel. The steak was good. Staff helped with directions and advice. Good price, good service, pleasant stay."
Mar 2017,50,"Lovely hotel, great staff","We stayed here for two nights. Excellent hotel, fabulous location on a pedestrian only street (after 10 a.m.).  Construction next door but it was still quiet with windows shut. No view. Room very pleasant. Comfortable bed and bathroom. No robe. Fabulous huge fluffy towels! Free minibar. One night they left us a treat in our room. Lots of nice touches including afternoon tea and pastries. Would definitely return. Helpful staff especially Julie(?) who made recommendations for restaurants and activities. Highly recommend."
Mar 2017,50,Wonderfull birthday stay.,"We stayed here for four nights to celebrate my birthday. the hotel was central to all the sites and we easily found our own way by taking the metro from the airport...easy to navigate and took about 45 minutes. Save your top up tickets for the buses and trams , tram 28 great fun.The hotel was lovely. All staff very friendly and helpful. The staff noted that it was my birthday from my passport and left Carva wine, cake and a lovely note in our room.We had a suite with a jacuzzi with a travel set of L'Occitane toiletries nice touches. The breakfast, self serve, was really good and kept my husband fed for hours.Well placed for a sightseeing, everything so close."
Mar 2017,40,Excellent Hotel,"Stayed here for five nights visiting Lisbon, took the metro from the airport...easy to navigate and took about 45 minutes.  What a lovely hotel, staff all very friendly and helpful, we had a suite with a jacuzzi which was a must after walking the hills all day.  Well appointed with hotel toiletries plus a travel set of L'Occitane toiletries and some pillow mist and lip salve...nice touches ☺️breakfast is self serve but has all you need to set up for a days sightseeing. I have only two complaints...there was significant building works opposite...although when the balcony doors were closed you couldn't hear a thing...I like to sleep with windows open and sit on balconies watching the world go by...but the noise prevented that...the builders even worked through the night on one occasion 😤not the hotels fault of course but I would have avoided it had I known.  The other was a meal taken in the restaurant one evening...I chose cod cooked in the local style....was not nice at all...very dry and chewy...worst and most expensive evening meal I had over the holiday.However, I would return if the building works opposite had finished and I wouldn't eat there again in the evening. It is a lovely friendly hotel and perfectly placed for sightseeing and access to bus, tram and metro services."
Mar 2017,50,Exceptional Hotel,"Location - right beside a myriad of metro stops (2 metro rides from the airport - one change); 2 minute walk to the tram stops and bus stops (tip - the bus back from Belem is far quicker than the 15 tram - can't remember the number but would recommend looking it up), 5 minute walk to the main square ; 2 minute walk to the Santa Justa Lift; 10 minute walk to Bairro Alto & Chiado; 15-20 minute walk to Sao Jorge depending on how fast you walk. In a word, the most perfect location possible.Room - we had a room on the 4th floor with a small balcony. The room itself was very large, extremely comfortable bed, free mini bar (cokes, waters, orange juice, a beer), free pastries and port on arrival, fabulous shower; a small table and a dressing table both with separate chairs, UK and European plug sockets, ample wardrobe space, great toiletries, a safe, completely sound proof (even with works going on next door). Nespresso machine, pods topped up daily.Staff - prior to booking, Joao sent through a city guide and was very responsive to all my emails (responses within 5-10 minutes). I requested a nice room for my fiance's birthday, absolutely no problem. When we arrived we were greeted with a map and Luis showed us all the places to go. Cleaning staff were honestly exceptional - always replenished everything and left the room sparkling - even when we left the room around mid day one day.Value for Money - exceptional - it's in line with other 4 star hotels in Lisbon though, in the best location with an above average sized room. We didn't eat breakfast here or dinner but all looked nice and you get 10% off for staying at the hotel. We looked forward to coming back here every night. Honestly, couldn't recommend this place highly enough - I hope we return soon."
Mar 2017,50,Excellent Hotel Ideally Situated,"We cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. It is ideally located in the Baixa region of the city in a quiet pedestrianised area. It is within easy (on the level) walking distance of metro and railway stations. There are many nearby restaurants, bars and shops. Having taken the red bus sightseeing bus tours around the city we concluded that the Hotel Santa Justa appeared to be situated in the most ideal area of the city. The Hotel has modern decor throughout, the furnishings are of high quality, it is spotlessly clean everywhere. The public bar/restaurant area is a both airy and pleasantly comfortable space.Our bedroom (407) was comfortably large.  (We were provided with complimentary Port and Custard Tarts on arrival which was a nice touch).  Well equipped, the bedroom had a very comfortable kingsize double bed, a desk and chairs and a Safe, A Nespresso coffee making machine is available in the room (although only two pods are provided each day we noticed that you could buy compatible coffee pods in several local shops).   There was adequate clothes storage and space to stow suitcases. The bathroom was large and well lit, having large mirrors and plenty of space to lay out toiletries. The walk in shower was huge and a joy to experience. Fresh towels were provided each day. Above all the room was exceptionally well sound proofed and the air conditioning worked silently and efficiently.The WiFi was very high speed and worked reliably throughout the hotel. The Hotel Staff were exceptional, all pleasant, knowledgeable and competent. All spoke very good English. We enjoyed eating several nights at two local restaurants which had been recommended by the hotel desk staff, ""A Licorista O Bacalhoeiro"" and the ""Leitaria Camponeza"" which I have separately reviewed.   Both provided us with very enjoyable, yet relatively inexpensive, dining experiences.The Hotel puts on free of charge Fado on a Tuesday evening in the bar restaurant area. Two guitarists and a lady singer providing high quality entertainment in the later evening; excellent to come back to after you have been out for your evening meal. A good tip is to ask the Hotel to prearrange private transfers if arriving/leaving at the airport.  We enjoyed very pleasant and informative english speaking chauffeur service in both directions at little extra cost than that of an airport Taxi trip.  We unconditionally recommend this Hotel and we would definitely choose to stay there again on any future Lisbon break."
Mar 2017,50,Great hotel- small European rooms,"Great location, superb staff and reasonably priced. Bathrooms much better than in any European hotel than I have seen (spacious and functional). Hotel is within walking distance of all transportation modes (bus, metro etc) Would use this hotel again on my next trip to Lisbon."
Mar 2017,50,Highly recommended!,"The location is perfect.  It is a 2 minute walk from the Rossi metro station, which you can take from the airport via Red Line and Green Line for 1.45 Euros. And 3 minutes from the Blue Line Baixa Chiado metro.  Of course, the metro connects you to everything else.  It is a 1-minute walk from the Square and the river, where you find the tourist Yellow bus or Hop-on-hop-off buses and tram stops that will allow you to explore the entire city at your own pace.  Immediately below the hotel are several eating joints with great prices and authentic Portugese cuisine as well as shops for souvenirs, etc.  The hotel staff are very pleasant and eager to help and very patient with all questions asked. The rooms are perfect with ironing board and welcome port wine and chocolate. The huge square shower is flush with the ceiling, like a rain shower with lights. So enjoyable. Cannot think of anything that could be improved."
Mar 2017,40,"Nice hotel, Helpful staff, Good location","This hotel is located in the central pedestrianized area of Lisbon with lots of nearby shops and eateries.  It's about 100 metres away from where the local and tourist trams/buses stop and a short (10 minute) walk to the main square (Praça do Comércio) by the harbour side .  The old town (Alfama) area is also within easy reach either by foot (uphill) or by tram (or electric tup tup).  The Santa Justa lift  is a short stroll away.  We were warmly greeted by the reception staff at this small boutique style hotel.  Fortunately our room was ready despite our early arrival.  Our room was average size, but was very nicely appointed as was the bathroom.  Unusually, the mini bar was free and was stocked with soft drinks, water and even a beer.  Another nice touch was the small bottle of port which was left for us as a gift upon arrival.  We took up the breakfast deal offered on arrival.  Although the restaurant in the reception area is small, it was fine and had a reasonable selection of hot and cold breakfast items.  The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful with the usual tourist requests for directions, transportation and bookings.  They also gave us a couple of very good recommendations for dinner.  There were some major building works taking place opposite the hotel at the time of our visit in March 2017, but we were up reasonably early every day, and out exploring the city for most of the day, so it wasn't too intrusive.  There are quite a few restaurants along the street close to the hotel, so be prepared to be inundated with polite offers of dinner, lunch or drinks as you walk to and from the hotel.  Nothing too persistent - a firm 'no thank you' sufficed."
Mar 2017,30,"good location, everything was great","very centrally located, room was clean, bed was comfortable.  Complimentary port and custard tarts!  Handy for everything.  Dimly lit, could have done with a central ceiling light fitting.  Very little space for putting your clothes, we had to keep them on the floor, otherwise, would recommend."
Mar 2017,40,The Best Location,This Hotel was located near all of the action including the river and the Time Out Market. The rooms and bathrooms on the inside were very clean. The free minibar was also a plus along with the free wifi. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The Fado concert was amazing. Great memories. We would go back there.
Mar 2017,50,Modern with Location ,"Great service, good breakfast and wonderful shower. Louis and Mariana went the extra mile for us. COULDN'T be happier. Restaurant was a real plus. High tech everywhere. Loved it.located on pedestrian streets  so pla accordingly."
Mar 2017,50,Perfect stay,"Stayed for 3 nights with friends and can't fault the hotel in any way. A perfect base which was close to the station and centre of Lisbon which is a very walkable city anyway. Every staff member was very approachable and more than happy to help with anything. Breakfast was delicious with a good variety of hot and cold options. There was also great live music on two nights during our stay. Our superior room was very spacious and comfortable with more than enough amenities. We loved every second of our trip to Lisbon and I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting, and hope to return to stay here again soon."
Mar 2017,50,Perfect location and luxurious stay,"During a weekend away with a few friends, we stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa for the simple reason that they had rooms large enough to accommodate three adults.  The rooms are great.  They are modern, provide spa-level shampoos and body washes, robes and slippers, and comfortable beds.  The service was also very good.  They gave us a free upgrade to a suite and offered wonderful suggestions for food and drinks.  The location of the hotel is perfect.  It is only a ten minute walk from the neighborhoods of Alfama and Barrio Alto.  This was a great stay.  I highly recommend Hotel Santa Justa."
Feb 2017,40,Very comfortable hotel in historic Lisbon,"We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Santa Justa. My two adult daughters and I booked a suite for our weekend stay.  It was very clean and comfortable.  We felt very welcome and thought the hotel staff, particularly Nadiya, was very helpful.  We loved Lisbon and will return."
Feb 2017,50,Fantastic. ,"Me and my partner stayed here for a week during the February half term and couldn't have wished for a better place to stay on our first trip to Lisbon. The location was perfect, central in Lisbon and very close to tourist attractions such as the Santa Justa lift and just a tram ride away from the Castle. The room was beautifully cleaned everyday and the fridge was restocked on a daily basis. All of the staff were very friendly and couldn't have done more to help, I would also recommend the hotels restaurant too. The food was amazing. Can't wait to return one day!"
Feb 2017,50,Excellent,"Excellent hotel in the city centre,pedestrian area every bus tram Subway nearby. Friendly staff, great Cuisine Tuesday night was a Fado night it was excellent. Rooms tidy clean with space, just accent. Really recommended."
Feb 2017,50,Welcome and Restful Hotel in Baixa,"After our welcome pastry and glasses of port, we felt right at home at the Hotel Santa Justa, located on a pedestrian street in the center of Lisbon's historic Baixa neighborhood. Check-in was a snap, with very friendly English-speaking staff who upgraded our room for free (indeed, as a surprise!) Our attic room was very spacious and modernly-tasteful, with a very comfortable king-sized bed, a couple of low beanbag-like chairs under to coved ceiling (cozy for watching TV during the rain), and a large, clean, and modern bathroom with lots of hot water in a spacious shower with a GIANT rainhead in the ceiling. Our room (and the shower!) had a charming rooftop view across the city to the ruins of the convent. We noticed no street noise, albeit on a rainy Saturday night in February. The on-site restaurant, The Elevator, was tasty and open til 11pm. They had live music earlier in the evening, which _might_ be hearable in lower rooms (though we don't know since we were on the 6th floor). The REAL elevator (up to our room) was fast, clean, and well-maintained. The hotel also has umbrellas to borrow, if you fancy a walk down Baixa's rain-glossed mosaic streets to the waterfront. We used the hotel's airport transfer service (25 Euros each way) and our driver was prompt, friendly, and gave us a brief intro and tour to the city in excellent English. However, the hotel is only a couple blocks from a metro station for those without 50 Euros burning a hole in their pocket. All-in-all, we had a wonderful stay (alas, for only one night) and look forward to a future visit!"
Feb 2017,40,One of my favorite hotel in lisbon,"Located in the very heart of Lisbon I discovered this hotel recently, brand new or renovated recently I do not know but everything is modern style: equipment, decoration,rooms, lifts etc..with a good taste. Staff is helpful . The standard  room we had ( No 504) ) was excellent: huge bed, large TV, 2 armchairs, bathroom perfect , no noise from the street, very clean.The 2 small negative points were: the restaurant room a bit small but well equiped and the fact that taxi cannot reach the hotel ( pedestrian street ) and let you about 80 meters from the door ( the positive point is you are not disturbed by the noise at night ! ) .We definitly go again to this hotel."
Feb 2017,50,Great hotel,"We booked this the day before we flew to Lisbon, and although it was almost fully booked we got very nice rooms. Huge and comfy bed, lovely bathroom (amazing shower), port and pastries to welcome us. The staff were delightful and exceptionally helpful, and the location is excellent---very close to shops, central so within easy walk of many attractions and close access to metro, buses, and trams"
Feb 2017,50,Girls Getaway ,"Perfectly located! You can walk to restaurants, shops, catch a trolley or a tour! Loved the convenience of this hotel. It is beautiful and the service was impeccable. Great environment. Great choice!!!"
Feb 2017,50,Very good - in all aspects,"This hotel is located at the center of Lisboa close (walking wise) to all the main locations of the town.  Modern facilities, large rooms, very comfortable beds, big bathroom and shower factilities, plenty of amenities (e.g. Nespresso machine), quite an extensive breakfast offerings and to top it off - very good cost performance.  Not to mention the staff which is very friendly and helpful.  The only problem is that the hotel is located on a pedestrian walkway half a block away from the nearest street / square which makes it a bit cumbersome to load / unload luggage.  Although the staff is more than willing to give a hand and help to carry the luggage to and from the hotel."
Jan 2017,50,"Great hotel, centrally located","Came here for sightseeing. The hotel is centrally located and just minutes away from the subway. Service is impeccable. Rooms are clean and well appointed. Own nespresso machine, free minibar, good bathroom. Prices are well acceptable. Would come back and recommend!"
Jan 2017,50,That's why I keep booking this hotel,Very beautiful hotel! Great service and very friendly staff! Breakfast is well served and has enough variety. All facilities are present and the rooms are very comfortable. Also good restaurant! Try the linguini with shrimps :-)
Jan 2017,50,Can't believe the bad review! This place is amazing!,"This is my regular hotel when I visit Lisboand I have been delighted with everything each time I visit.Was so surprised to read a bad review here, can't please everyone I suppose.The hotel is in the best spot for exploring, but what sets it apart is the wonderful attitude of the staff, they really do make your stay more enjoyable with their great service.The restaurant is top notch and I have always found the breakfast to be one of the best (and I stay in a lot of nice hotels when I travel) Looking forward to my next visit on Feb 19th.😃"
Jan 2017,50,Excellent stay,"This is a fantastic hotel. Upon arrival in our room we received a complementary bottle of port, custard tarts, and chocolate. All were fabulous! The wifi is excellent, the room is huge, the shower is delightful, and the bed is really comfy, especially with the extra pillows they provide. The air conditioning isn't great, but it's acceptable. We went in January and it was also nice to open up the windows a bit for some fresh air. The concierge is nice and the bar staff is really helpful (we bought some bottles of wine to our room and they opened them for us!). The only negative I can find is that the folks in the adjoining room were really noisy and the housekeeping is also pretty noisy."
Jan 2017,40,"Great location, nice hotel","Great location that is near :Attractions, river walk, metro, bus stations, restaurants .Nice and helpful staff. Clean and good sized rooms. I was on the first floor near the lift facing the street but it was still not noisy.Allowed to check in early free of charge. Good breakfast. Checked out on time but left luggage at the hotel so I could go out freely till I was ready to leave  Lisbon later in the day."
Jan 2017,50,Great Family Room Option,"We really enjoyed staying at the hotel Santa Justa. It is perfectly located to visit the city. Very busy area but we could not hear any noise from our rooms. The hotel staff was very helpful and courteous. The family room was fantastic. Our two kids really enjoyed having their own room which was opened to ours. This was the best family options I had seen and great price for it.The rooms are very big, clean and modern. The nespresso machine was a nice touch as well."
Jan 2017,40,Could not have been happier,"We booked here at the last minute, completely blind on Expedia with no real idea of what to expect.  What a great little (50 rooms) hotel.  The staff could not have been nicer or more friendly and accommodating, the room was great, huge shower in the bathroom and the food in the restaurant was excellent.  Overall, a great choice and I can't imagine you being disappointed if you stay here."
Jan 2017,50,Great stay at Santa Justa! ,"We stayed at Hotel Santa Justa during Christmas and loved every minute of our stay! We didn't eat in the restaurant but the location, helpful staff, rooms (junior suite), cleanliness, bathroom (lovely bathtub and shower) were fantastic. Definitely recommend!"
Dec 2016,20,Well below expectations ,We decided to go there relying on the Tripadvisor's rating. Mistake! The hotel is not at the level of a 4 stars. There is not enough value for the money. The restaurant is poor. The service is incredibly long and the food is just average. The breakfast is barely at the level of an average motel. The only good point is the service. The waiters and the receptionists are very nice. The rooms are clean. Finally the location of the hotel is great: right in the heart of the city
Dec 2016,50,Great location for a fair price,The location is awesome and on a quite street. Tons of restaurants are very close to the main commercial street. The rooms are all remodeled and bathrooms are impeccably kept. The breakfast buffet is the best deal to cover at the price with lots of items to stuff you for the whole day. Only issue with this place is cabs will not be able to drop you in front of the hotel. Wifi is pretty strong in the rooms and elevators are not busy.
Dec 2016,50,Perfect choice!,"I just finished a 4 day stay on my first trip to Portugal and I am beyond pleased worth my experience staying at this hotel. The location can't be beat as it is in the heart of the tourist attractions and everything you could possibly need. The hotel itself is on a busy cobblestone pedestrian street of shops and restaurants, but in spite of that I never heard a single thing in my 6th floor room. I used the car service arranged by the hotel from the airport and had no issues. The driver was still waiting for me with a sign even after immigration took nearly 2 hours to process through.The room was impeccably clean and the bed very comfortable. I didn't find myself wanting for any additional amenities. The room was a bit dark as it is an attic style being at the top floor and there was just one small window in the room - but this is not something I would consider a major bother but I could see it being an issue for someone else so ask for a room with more light if need be.I didn't partake of the breakfast and chose to procure coffee and a small breakfast item out on the local economy instead. But it sure did smell good downstairs each morning.The staff were beyond helpful with arranging contact with some tour companies prior to my arrival and were here to help with anything and everything while I was here.I very highly recommend this hotel for a comfortable boutique experience in the center of all the action!"
Dec 2016,40,Good value for money,"Great location, helpful and friendly staff, we received an upgrade so we had more room with the baby. Excellent breakfast, clean, stylish rooms. Would definitely come again. Parking could be an issue as it is in the middle of pedestrian zone but there are parking places a block away."
Dec 2016,40,Excellent ,"Stayed in this hotel for 5 days , it's very central for everything.  The tram stops and metro are a 5 minute walk . The staff were all very friendly . We had breakfast which was good . Buffet style . Ham,sausage fried egg , scrambled egg , baked beans and mixed veg. The cold buffet had an excellent choice, the brown bread was delicious. A good choice of pastries . Nespresso coffee.The room had a comfortable super king bed , a safe , the fridge had still water, sparkling water , orange juice, peach juice and  1 beer which was filled up every day. The shower was great plenty hot water . Had hairdryer and set of scales. Plenty soap, shower gel etc The room was cleaned everyday"
Dec 2016,40,"Yes, go ahead and book this one!","This is a great hotel. You better have a GPS to find it though but after you do you will be grateful. There are so many things to see near by. We only stayed one night, trained from Porto just to see the city. The staff is very helpful. They booked a Fado and dinner for us. The music was great and included in the price of the meal but the meal was super expensive, so beware. You get free port wine when you arrive which is always great."
Dec 2016,40,"Great location, friendly, helpful staff!","Just off the main square, so really busy nearby but not noisy. Very helpful staff on reception who's English is excellent- sorry I know should know a bit of Portuguese!The chamber maids do a fantastic job and keep the rooms very clean. And the shower is quite simply the best shower I have ever had! We will certainly stay here again if we come to Lisbon- it really is in a great location not far from a tube station and in the middle of where it's all happening!!"
Dec 2016,50,fab hotel in the centre of Lisbon,A gem of a hotel in the centre of Lisbon. The staff are helpful  nothing to much trouble.Rooms clean and modern with a fridge that is stocked daily.will definitely stay at this hotel when next in Lisbon
Dec 2016,50,So good we are going back,A belated review triggered by the fact we are going back in January. Hotel room was well equipped with many nice touches and very comfortable. We received a free upgrade to room with Jacuzzi bath.Location is great for exploring this great city. Recommended.
Dec 2016,40,Great location,"This hotel is situated in a street lined with restaurants.  The hotel lobby is small, the staff very, very friendly. We got some good recommendations for restaurants from them. Room was comfortable with free mini bar, soft drinks and water only!  We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on food."
Dec 2016,50,"A nifty modern hotel, perfectly located","The Santa Justa is a highly recommended modern hotel, perfectly located in Baixa, a few steps from Rosio and everything a tourist needs.Modern room is well planned and designed, effectively handling the challenges of limited space and the old building. Amazing shower with an immensely large ""rain head"". Beautiful sink and nifty soap, designed as a golf ball.Great stuff: friendly, smiling and efficient providing personal, yet courteous service."
Nov 2016,40,Excellent hotel in the centre of Lisbon,Hotel is handy for central Lisbon attractions and is very close to the shopping area.Did not experience excessive noise from being close to shopping area.Enjoyable buffet breakfast with good choice.Clean hotel and comfortable room.Friendly and helpful staff on reception.Would recommend this hotel.
Nov 2016,50,Great stay,"Stayed hear last year for the first time. Excellent location, as it's in the grid centre, not for from the main square, the castle and the harbour. Did not eat hear as so many good places to eat nearby. Also very good for airport bus transfer, as stop only 5 min away. Nicely decorated rooms with good air con. Thinking about returning as Been to Lisbon many times."
Nov 2016,50,Fabulous stay,"Perfect location with well trained and friendly staff. Food in the restaurant was lovely and very reasonably priced given the  touristy central location. We booked a standard comfort room which was really well sized, super shower, and included the mini bar which was restocked with soft drinks daily. Also found some little custard tarts and a quarter bottle of port in our room on the first night. Breakfasts lovely, with lots of cold choices, and some hot things. Overall would highly recommend this hotel"
Nov 2016,40,V. good with room for improvement,"Great location in the centre of everything, just off Placa Figuera. Hotel is in safe area.10 mins walk-Avenida Liberdade3 mins walk-Chiado10 mins walk-martim Moniz where you can ride the tram 28 from the beginningvery easily reached to Aerobus stops to and from airport, stop is literally 2 mins walk.Small lobby. Room is v nice just like the pics, very decent bathroom (size and amenities are great). Great rainfall shower.Well lit room too.Free drinks in minibar and daily refills for Nespresso machine.There is a bit of noise from the street, especially in the am hours when restaurants are setting up and around 11 pm when restaurants are packing up, but we did not find that to be unpleasant. Once the windows are closed, noise was minimum. Room for improvement:Front desk gentlemen are helpful and efficient but not friendly, they do not smile at all!Housekeeping could be better.Overall, we like it a lot."
Nov 2016,50,"Location, Stylish and Great Service","This was our first visit to Lisbon and we couldn't have found a better hotel. The location was perfect, rooms were stylish and clean, service was great. We would definitely stay here again (and again). They were super accommodating, gave us a late check out."
Nov 2016,50,Great hotel in the best location.,"Great service at the best location.  We had a great time staying at your hotel.  Friendly staff, clean comfortable room, and a very good restaurant.  Would definitely stay there again.  Really nothing else to say."
Nov 2016,50,Well located hotel,"This really is a most convenient hotel, with extremely friendly staff. You can access many tourist sights within a walk...or via nearby public transport. Rossio Metro is barely 5 mins walk and so good for the airport. We took an attic room as the street below is full of restaurants and we wanted undisturbed sleep at night...no problem all very quiet albeit this was November with darker nights and less visitors. The room was spacious, well appointed and the daily replenished mini bar was a nice touch."
Nov 2016,50,Ate at the restaurant only. Unbelievable!,"Usually I avoid hotel dining options but it was a night that we just didn't want to spend too much time walking around and searching for our dinner. The streets were busy with All Saints Day revelers and we were hungry.  We had passed up on the restaurant in the Hotel Santa Justa initially despite getting several thumbs up from diners and promises of glory from the host and hostess.  We ventured down the street a bit and were confronted with plastic menu after plastic menu and aggressive hosts.  Feel very turned off by that, we came back to the calm and elegant Hotel Santa Justa and asked for a table for 4 outside.Seated right away, we had several different servers attending to us immediately.  They brought water, bread and a cheese plate that we all ended up fighting over because it was truly delicious. They brought wine and cocktails which were crafted nicely and flowed perfectly with the appetizers.We ordered food shortly after and each one of us were pretty sure we had the best meal at the table.  Our eyes grew bigger and bigger as we passed around samples of our dishes to each other until we ran out of food. We marveled at the flavors and complimented our server, Antonio, on the exquisite tastes and out of the world textures.  He mentioned to us that the head chef had the night off and it was the su chef in charge of the meals that night.  We had the Santa Justa cod, Octopus, grilled sirloin steak with SPECIAL SAUCE, and shrimp risotto.The food was so wonderful that we came back a few nights later for our final meal in Lisbon. In a city with legendary food, we made that repeat visit knowing we would be in excellent hands and our taste buds would be happy.  The 2nd time around, Jacir was our server and he made sure we were happy. Antonio joined us and brought us some of their best porto to celebrate the end of our great time in Lisbon.  We chatted with the servers and ended up taking pictures with them.I can honestly say now I remember the best meal of my life. It was Monday October 31st, 2016 in Lisbon at the Elevador - Hotel Santa Justa."
Nov 2016,50,Brilliant city centre hotel,"I have stayed at many city hotels and this has to be about the best in recent years. Located in the pedestrian area and close to many of the attractions. Great rooms, quiet with good bed, good lighting, space for luggage and aircon that works. Good bathroom with rain shower and separate WC. Attention to detail was excellent. Clean and well presented. They even sent a complimentary bottle of Port to our room. The staff could not have been more helpful and made our stay that bit better, and helped with sightseeing and restaurant reservations. Breakfast was great too. A nice quiet and friendly hotel and would thoroughly recommend."
Nov 2016,50,great stay,"The service at this hotel is outstanding  The front desk staff were friendly and very knowledgeable. They had wonderful suggestions for restaurants as well as transportation options for our excursions.  We arrived to a bottle of champagne in the room since we had mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary!  The hotel has a perfect location for many of Lisbon's most historic sights. It's clean, quiet and has a great breakfast."
Nov 2016,40,Some of the best staff ever,"Hotel is well located with lots of nearby restaurants, shops etc. Restaurant menu is limited but of good standard. Seating area near bar and restaurant could do with being made a little more comfortable. Staff were friendly, courteous and efficient. I noticed them going out of their way on one night where there was music to dance with some middle aged Americans to their great amusement. They still found time to look after the rest of the customers and keep everyone happy. I would say its the best overall staff experience I have ever had with no individual slip ups"
Nov 2016,40,Great central location ,Lovely boutique hotel in the centre of Lisbon.Courteous and helpful staff.Accommodation overlooked the pedestrian only street.Several al fresco dining establishments on the street below.Quite noisy (atmospheric 😎) early evening.Room quite small but very comfortable with complimentary Espresso coffee pods.Good restaurants 5-10 minutes walk.10 minutes to harbour.Airport approx 30 mins by taxi.Nearby vegan restaurant absolutely superb.Only minor niggle was the limited buffet breakfast. Expect more variety and content in a hotel of this type.Would certainly go back.DC
Nov 2016,50,Fantastic stay October 2016,"Great location, fabulous facilities, friendly helpful staff, excellent restaurant. Best holiday we've had for years. Comment to kitchen hot bar sandwiches could be improved other wise excellent choice at breakfast, and very good extras with our package such as free mini bar refilled daily , port and Portuguese pastries left in room was a real treat. Extremely comforatble beds and excellent amineties. Thank you and would return to this hotel in heartbeat."
Oct 2016,50,Prime location,"We chose this hotel for our first visit to Lisbon, and what a good choice. Very central, clean & beautifully appointed, with friendly, helpful staff. We had a superior room on the fifth floor, which had the largest, most comfortable bed ever! Breakfast had a wide and varied selection of food to satisfy all tastes - including the delicious Portuguese custard tarts, of which one just isn't enough. These were provided in our room along with a small bottle of port as a welcome from the hotel on our first evening - a nice touch, as was the little bag of L'Occitane creams. A good base for exploring the city, and a stroll away from the Tagus. A good place for lunch on the same street is The Lady & The Tramp - excellent pizza & pasta, and for the best gelato try Fragoleto on Rua da Prata."
Oct 2016,50,Great hotel! best location!,"We were in Lisbon for 4 days, and could not have asked for a better hotel.  The location was unbelievable with everything only a stones throw away.  Since it was a walking street, we had to get dropped off at the main street and walk a few minutes.  Cars are only allowed to the hotel until 10 am. The hotel does not look very impressive from outside as it is in a busy walking street with restaurants on both sides.  However, once you are inside, it is built in a modern manner.   We were lucky to get the best room in the hotel. Staff were very friendly.  We did not take up the breakfast in the hotel as there are hundreds of restaurants and cafes in the adjoining lanes and by lanes. We would highly recommend this hotel."
Oct 2016,50,Great hotel for a Lisbon break,"Spent a long weekend here with my wife, it was a great hotel to stay in. Lovely clean and comfortable rooms with complimentary drinks in the minibar.  It very modern and stylish throughout.  Breakfast was very nice although not loads of choice. Never ate in the restaurant although the food looked very good.  The staff at the front desk were very helpful and spoke great English.It is situated in a great location, just down from one of the main squares and surrounded by streets with lots of places to eat and drink.  It also just near the famous Santa Justa lift.  This is a great hotel to stay at for any time spent in Lisbon."
Oct 2016,50,A delight!,"What a delight!  Fresh, well-decorated and modern rooms with high-quality amenities.  Outstanding breakfast buffet.  Very helpful staff.  Very good singer/keyboard musician in the bar on the weekends.Great location with nice views.I would definitely return and recommend."
Oct 2016,50,Lisbon Experience!!!,"Wonderful hotel in a very central location. Lisbon is hilly but this hotel is central to the main shopping and restaurant area Perfect for anyone with walking difficulties.Easy access to shops, trams, buses and tourist locations.The hotel is situated in an area surrounded by numerous restaurants which are wonderful for fresh obster and crab etc. We also ate in the hotel restaurant which was good with excellent service.Breakfasts are excellent with a wide range of cold meats, breads, smoked salmon and cereals. The hotel kindly provide new guests with a welcome bottle of port and custard pastries. The rooms are modern with excellent facilities and comfortable beds. Our bathroom had a fantastic rain-shower. Toiletries are provide and replenished daily although soap is not provided. Coffee machine in each room.The staff are very knowledgeable and keen to help guests with information and guidance.It was a wonderful, relaxing experience. The hotel Santa Just was an excellent choice and we hope to return soon.I would highly recommend this hotel for a Lisbon city-break!!"
Oct 2016,50,Lisbon vacay,"Just stayed at this hotel. Loved it. Nice rooms, great service. Location is perfect, lots to do, great restaurants around it. The front desk staff is so gracious and helpful, especially Pedro and David. They go above and beyond to make you feel welcome."
Oct 2016,50,Love this hotel!,"From the moment you walk in you are greeted by warm, friendly welcoming staff. They are patient and will help you plan your visit to the city with suggestions for sites, lunch, dinner, shows etc. They really make this property. The rooms are clean, modern, comfortable with flat screen TV and access to English programming. Bathrooms are large and well equipped. Beds are comfortable. The location is perfect for touring the city. Lots of bars and restaurants within in a few feet of the front door. we stayed for three days and hated to leave."
Oct 2016,40,Excellent location & staff!,"This was our first trip to Lisbon and Hotel Santa Justa could not have been in a better location! It was central to everything. The rooms were well designed - modern but not overly modern and there were even a couple American outlets in our room which was nice. We had the adaptors but didn't have to use them. Even though the hotel is so close to everything, it was still nice and quiet. The free mini bar drinks is a great touch - soft drinks, juice and water. Refilled every day by housekeeping. The front desk was very helpful with maps and recommendations. Nadiya recommended a restaurant called Sacramento which was excellent! Before we even arrived at the hotel, we were able to set up airport transportation and have some questions answered via email before our arrival. We have also stayed at their sister hotel in Madrid - Hotel Preciados which we also highly recommend. If we return to Lisbon, we would not hesitate to stay At Hotel Santa Justa again."
Oct 2016,50,Surpassed expectations,"We can't speak highly enough of our stay here.  Location is great, central for all sites either walking or by transport links.  We booked one of the smaller rooms but certainly big enough for 3 nights, small juilette balcony overlooking a lively pedestrian street but honestly closed windows and air con gave a silent and dark night for a good sleep.  However, lot's of added extras; pillow chocolates, half bottle of port and pastries on our first evening, complimentary soft drinks mini bar and free coffee and pastries in the lounge daily. Added bonus of UK plug sockets in room!  The reception team were really helpful and friendly from arrival to departure."
Oct 2016,50,Great hotel for city break!,"The hotel is well situated for walking to most of the tourist attractions and for taking public transport, including the trams. Our room was modern and quiet despite the central location. Breakfast was good and there was free afternoon tea, coffee and pastries available in the bar - nice touch after a day of sightseeing! The staff were friendly and helpful, much appreciated when it is your first time visiting a city."
Oct 2016,40,Great Hotel,this is a great Hotel in the heart of the old city right near the Elevator.  Our first floor hotel room well furnished and was surprisingly quite considering it overlooked a street filled with great restaurants.The staff were very  helpful and friendly and it was a great pleasure to stay there we had a wonderful time in the City
Oct 2016,40,"Nice, but pack earplugs!","I stayed here 4 nights recently on my first trip to Lisbon for a vacation.  The hotel and location are great overall.Pros:- Location is perfect for visiting the tourist attractions in Lisbon, you can walk to pretty much all major sights except Belem- Rooms are clean- Hotel staff are very nice and helpful- Free minibar is a great plus! Water bottles and soft drinks replenished daily.- Live music in the lobby area a few nights a weekCons:- Uncomfortable pillows and hard, uncomfortable mattresses- Thins walls - you can hear your neighbors at times and closing doors in the hallway are especially loud- Closing the bathroom door automatically turned on the closet light, so not great if one person in the room has to get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night- Located on a pedestrian street, so cabs can't stop in front (we actually liked this but it could be a problem if you have trouble carrying all of your luggage about a block)If they got softer beds I would definitely stay here again!"
Sep 2016,40,"Nice staff, nice rooms, nice breakfast","We stayed in this hotel for three nights a few weeks ago.Staff:  All very friendly, all very helpful, especially Marianna and Joao Location:  Central.  Lots of restaurants, close to Rossio Square rail station, close to quite a few squaresRooms:  A bit small, clean, modern bathroom, had a safe, Wi-Fi and a refrigerator, quietBreakfast:  Fresh eggs, fruits, breads, pastries, cheesesLobby:  Nice with sofasA welcome bottle of port on the day of the arrival"
Sep 2016,40,Lisbon city break,"we stayed 4 nights at the Santa Justa on a room only basis and thorougly enjoyed our stay. The room wa spacious and airy with good quiet air con. very comfortable bed for a good nights sleep.Ww didnt eat at the hotel so cannot comment on the food but all the staff we came in contact with were helpful and friendly, all speaking good english.The hotel is situated just below placa do Rossio so easy to visit all the central sights and pick up trams etc. The area around the hotel is flat which was a bonus as lisbon is hilly.Everywhere was very busy and hot so we found it best to go out first thing in the morning and avoid some of the crowds.All in all a very enjoyable stay a place I'd want to go back to."
Sep 2016,50,Great place to stay,"We ended up at this hotel after the one we'd originally booked, the International Design Hotel, had an issue with our room and couldn't accomodate our booking. We got moved for free to the Hotel Santa Justa. And while I'm not sure about the other hotel, we're glad we did! The location is very hard to beat, walking distance to pretty much everything. Room was very comfortable with a great bed and nice rain shower. They even sent a little welcome gift of port and Portuguese tart to our room! Would definitely recommend to stay here, service as great and very helpful- they even escorted us to our car with our bags to then let us out of the car park.Only odd thing- we were there for 2 nights and after spending the whole day out on the second day, came back to find they hadn't made up our room. This was around 5pm which we found odd. Car parking is very close but very expensive! Apparently this is the case in Lisbon so nothing the hotel can do!"
Sep 2016,50,Perfect!,"Perfectly located in the middle of the Baixa area of Lisbon, close to the Santa Justa elevator. Many landmarks as well as metro, bus and tram station just a short walk away. Very quiet room, despite the central location of the Hotel. Comfortable and spacious room, modern style. Very professional and friendly staff (housekeeping, restaurant and reception). Would choose this hotel any time again."
Sep 2016,30,"Restaurant food terrific, but would not take a credit card!","Definitely would go back for the food, but at the end, they would not take our credit card.  Not that many people carry 100+ euros on them and they would only take cash since their ONE machine ""malfunctioned""...seriously?  One credit card machine for the whole restaurant/hotel?  Come on!  Felt as though we were being scammed and not sure who in the end got that cash!"
Sep 2016,40,"GREAT LOCATION, SMALL ROOMS","I was disappointed at the size of the room -after looking quite generous on the website; but after discussion was given a slightly larger room, with much bigger bathroom on 5th level. After initial disappointment, the great staff, the great location all came to make the stay very good. It is surrounded by restaurants and street life; double glazing keeps the room quiet."
Sep 2016,40,"Excellent location, very good service","First time in Lisboa, this was a good location for those who want to be in the middle of the city and want walking access to the main centro area as well as Alfama, Mouraria and Baixa Alta.  Rooms are contemporary with terrific space, hot water, and rooms are quiet despite being in the middle of the action"
Sep 2016,50,"Lovely hotel, great service!","Hotel Santa Justa is very well located, convenient to many of Lisbon's fine attractions.  Some very good restaurants are located nearby and the very friendly, knowledgeable concierge staff will be very happy to help with their local knowledge and a recommendation for a special dinner or lunch.The rooms are spacious and have good size bathrooms.  The accommodation is well appointed, spotless (and very quiet with the double glazed windows).The hotel accomodation is competitively priced and the rooms have an iron, ironing board and a free minibar too.We really enjoyed our 5 night stay.  Highly recommended!"
Sep 2016,50,centrally located modern boutique hotel,"This hotel is right in the middle of the Baixa pedestrian zone (you may have to walk your luggage in a few blocks).  Our family of four had two rooms at the end of a hall and the ability to close off the hallway to create a private foyer, which is a great setup; combined with the spacious rooms we were very comfortable.  The rooms are really nice -- roomy and well appointed, including a Nespreso machine and free minibar, and one room had a great view of the Santa Justa elevator!  The furnishings are modern, which in a few cases is a little annoying (I don't like pedestal sinks because there is nowhere to put your stuff, and the desk/table is a little rickety), but is overall light and comfortable.  Fantastic big showers.  The breakfast buffet was in my opinion, somewhat overpriced but had a lot of good choices.  You also get a welcome gift of natas (yum!) and a small bottle of port.  The staff was very helpful and was also responsive to all my questions by email prior to our arrival."
Sep 2016,50,Beautiful and modern hotel in the heart of Baxia.,"The hotel was in the perfect location to shopping, dining and site seeing. It had all the modern amenities and a rain shower and soaker tub to relax in after a long adventure packed day. The staff was helpful and kind."
Sep 2016,40,Well located property in Lisbon,"Overall, our stay at the Hotel Santa Justa was comfortable and convenient.  I would recommend it to anyone traveling for pleasure.  Another couple also stayed with us, and the hotel assigned us to adjoining rooms, which was nice (even though we hadn't asked).  One of the things we really appreciated was that, even though the rooms looked directly over a very busy placa, the windows, when closed, provided excellent soundproofing from the very busy and noisy pedestrian traffic, music and restaurant noise.  The front desk staff were very helpful to us, not only with the typical requests (directions, restaurant recommendations, etc.), but they were able to reach our airline's offices after normal business hours when our return flight plans went awry.  The beds were comfortable, and the shower (a large rainfall-style head) an unexpectedly nice touch."
Sep 2016,50,Very nice boutique hotel,"I can only recommend this hotel, the location is excellent, within walking distance to lots of attractions, it is quiet and yet in the middle of the city centre. Staff is very nice and professional, they gave us some very good recommendations as to bus tours etc. We stayed on the top floor and har a nice view to Elevador. Rooms are very clean.Will definitely stay here when in Lisbon next time."
Sep 2016,40,Good location ,"We stayed here on a short break to Lisbon.  The hotel is clean and centrally located.  Although on a busy pedestrian street, the street noise was minimal and to be expected for the location.   Had a decent breakfast and friendly and helpful staff.  Would stay again."
Sep 2016,40,Lovely evening meal,"We visited the restaurant on the final evening of our holiday. We had a lovely meal whilst sitting in the cool hotel interior on a very hot and humid evening. We were treated to some live music which was mellow and very pleasant adding to the general ambience. The food was very good. Jacir in particular was very welcoming and ensured we enjoyed our meal. We were not hurried in any way, he was attentive but not intrusive. The other staff on duty were also friendly and accommodating. If it hadn't been our last evening we would have returned again for another meal."
Sep 2016,40,Excellent location and nice new hotel.,We w ere very happy with our stay here. A small hotel with nice rooms. Quiet as well.Very clean and a very good location.Breakfast had lots of fresh fruit and we enjoyed it.The front desk staff was helpful as well. There was live music at the bar on one evening.No complaints about our stay here.
Sep 2016,50,Ideal for long weekend,"Very nice hotel, central location and the staff were excellent. All in all I would recommend it to people. Short walk (3 min.) to the harbor, the city center shops (2 min.) and the numerous tour buses (1 min.)"
Sep 2016,50,Great Hotel,"This is a great hotel with an excellent location to travel around to all the sites in Lisbon.The hotel is clean with good food and the staff are always helpful, all you need to do is ask.Would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and would have no problem returning to Lisbon.The Fado evening recommended by the hotel was really worth doing and very entertaining so do it😎😎😎"
Sep 2016,20,Baby,"There is no baby foods there. They are very slow to inform you. They dont really behave you in a good ways. They are not bery kind. We ask for taxi from aitport they send us a taxi 25 euro. (İt cost  10 euro) . We dont like this kind of cheasy behaviours. They have tea time, but no serving and nothing. I just want some milk for baby, they charge it."
Sep 2016,40,Nice hotel in the middle of Lisbon,"The rooms are very attractive and spacious for a reasonable price.  I stayed in a suite.  It's so easy to see the sights and walk to any adequate restaurant nearby.  Take ten minutes and walk up the hill to where all of the nightclub/bars are.  Party your brains out and walk down the hill and back to the hotel.  It's difficult to get lost.  The staff is extremely nice and very helpful.  I will definitely return because of the nicely appointed rooms, highly desirable location.  hint - use uber while you are there about half the price of the taxis"
Sep 2016,50,"Excellent location, outstanding amenities","The hotel is located steps away from Plaza Figueira on Rua de Correeiros in the Baixa district making it absolutely close to everything. Rua dos Correeiros and the adjoining Rua Augusta are pedestrian streets so there are tons of bars and eating places and shops to choose from. The room was decorated in a very modern style and was very comfortable in size for my wife and me. We were very pleasantly surprised by the level of free amenities provided - lots of good quality toiletries in the bathroom, a bathroom with Jacuzzi bathtub, robes and slippers (which came in very handy as the air-conditioning worked exceptionally well), a mini fridge that was stocked with water, juice and soft drinks that we could use at no cost, a free bottle of wine in the room at arrival, and Nespresso coffee-maker with free capsules. We have no hesitation in recommending Hotel Santa Justa to other visitors, or to stay at the hotel if we visit Lisbon again."
Sep 2016,40,"Good, comfortable hotel in a great location!","Good, clean hotel in a amazing location. We stayed 3 nights and had a suite. The room was spacious and the minibar was free and refilled every day! There's no pool or gym but that's ok because the location is unbeatable. Within walking distance there's many restaurants both expensive and budget. Shopping is great as well and the people at reception will give you great recommendations."
Sep 2016,50,"High class hotel, central location, modest price","The hotel is located in a large, attractive pedestrian zone with lively outdoor restaurants, two blocks from Rossio Square (the main central square of Lisbon, filled with more outdoor restaurants and cafes), near the main tourist sights and best shopping district. The hotel is modern and spotlessly clean, the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was large with a spacious bathroom, good wi-fi and air-conditioning, and a very comfortable bed. The cable TV had international channels including English-language news. We felt that we were staying in a top-class hotel at an affordable price."
Sep 2016,50,Lovely hotel with wonderful service!,"We had a suite in this lovely hotel, which was large enough for my husband, daughter and I to have our own spaces. It was a pretty room and very comfortable. The hotel staff was attentive and helpful. The location is great - right near the Justa Elevator and in the center of everything. Would highly recommend!"
Sep 2016,40,Great hotel and great location,"The staff was very friendly. Our room was comfortable and very nice. The bathroom was spacious. The bed was comfortable. The room has a stocked mini bar that is replenished daily. The hotel is on a pedestrian street so there's a lot of foot traffic below. The good thing is that it's not noisy at night. The hotel is within walking distance of many main attractions. Just outside of the hotel, there are a lot of touristy restaurants. I wouldn't recommend any of those restaurants. The hotel's restaurant is quite good. In addition, a walk past the Santa Justa elevator and into the Chiado area will lead you to many restaurants that are of better quality than those just outside the hotel."
Aug 2016,10,Terrible. Dirty and overpriced.,"People, who rated the cleanness of this hotel as excellent, what are your standards???? The hotel is beyond any level of dirt, the maintenance is simply absent. My towels were simply gross - full of stains, grossly smelling. Dirty stains everywhere in the room, dirty floor. If I would not have a beach flip flowers, i would not even dare to step into the shower - it has not been cleaned for years, with soap remains and yellowish stains. What is the reason to cover the bathroom in marble if one never cleans it? Luxury is comfort, first and foremost. This place is comfortless. Yes, the stuff is nice and there is a free minibar with water and juice. But who needs a nice smiling stuff if the room is full of dust? I would NEVER stay there again. I am surprised how this place can be rated 4 stars. It's difficult to find a place less mismanaged than this hotel. No, i will not stay there again, and do not recommend to others."
Aug 2016,50,"Superb Location, Great Staff","I can't imagine a more convenient and central location. It's right downtown, close to (touristy, albeit) restaurants, a short walk–plus an unavoidable many step climb–to the trendy Barrio Alto area, to the Plaza Commercio, and the Alfama old quarter. The Metro stop, Rossio, is just five minutes from the hotel, making it an efficient and cheap route to and from the airport.The front desk and restaurant/bar staff were universally welcoming and helpful. A special ""shout out"" to Daniel and Nadiya who spent time with us to share their recommendations on good local restaurants and advice around planning a day trip to Sintra.The hot and cold buffet breakfast was tasty and had variety.Our room was clean, modern, well lit, quiet, and well insulated from the noise of the busy street below. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom had a walk-in shower stall with a rather intriguing rain shower from the ceiling.It had its downsides, however: (1) only two tiny (think shoe box) drawers and tight closet space for hanging clothes. (2) there was a sliding door along one wall gave access to the (a) mini-bar/coffee maker/closet and also the bathroom…but not at the same time!! It was very inconvenient and I think they should get some money back from the architect who designed that feature. (3) I would have liked regular in-room coffee, not just expresso.Despite these inconveniences, I still give it a five."
Aug 2016,50,"Great hotel in a great location, with nice staff","The location is really nice next to a lot of shopping and sights. It's a walk up to Hotel as car traffic is mostly closed off to the area. You will have to tell your taxi driver to drop off at Praca de Figueira to get you close. The staff was great and the rooms were nice. We had a family room which is great with kids. We had only one issue with a slight sewage smell coming from the streets when the ac was off. Otherwise, the other room with our family was just fine with smell.I highly recommend this hotel. It's not 5 star, but it's the best for the price in the area."
Aug 2016,50,Great visit to Lisbon,"Clean, comfortable and modern hotel on a charming street in the hustle and bustle of Lisbon. Very friendly and helpful staff who speak English as well as a number of other languages. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is value conscious and also looking for a higher end hotel to spend not just one but several nights. Seems to be walking distance to everything."
Aug 2016,50,Wonderful Hotel in Lower Lisbon City Center,"I stayed for 3 nights and wasn't disappointed.The service, quality, and comfort were the best.I appreciate all the attention to detail to make awonderful stay in beautiful Lisbon.So convenient to the attractions and restaurants in thearea, as well."
Aug 2016,50,Wonderful stay in Lisbon,"My friend and I traveled to Lisbon last week and we were thrilled with the Santa Justa hotel- great location near lots of squares, not far from major sightseeing spots. The hotel itself is modern, has the most amazing concierge (Vera especially was helpful), and is located on a quiet street. Make sure to check out the Santa Justa Lift nearby for sweeping views of Lisbon."
Aug 2016,40,Very nice hotel,"The Hotel Santa Justa is elegant, impeccably clean and modern. Our room was a decent size, the air conditioning worked well (if a tad bit noisy), the walk in shower and large bathroom were pleasant surprises. As other reviewers have mentioned, the hotel is on a very touristy, pedestrian street. Our room looked directly across into people's apartments, but we weren't there for the view and kept the drapes closed. The sturdy safe, Nespresso machine and free mini-bar were nice touches. The breakfast was the same food every day, but was good quality and the seating area was spacious. Did I mention the area is touristy? Very convenient to the metro and Chiado is only a few walk minutes away...but right outside the doors and in the immediate area are restaurants of the ""plastic menus with pictures and people haggling you on the street to get you to come sit"" kind. Perhaps there are some quality places amongst them, but I recommend walking a few minutes to a more charming area. The front desk staff was, for the most part, helpful and spoke English well. I was a bit put off by one of the receptionists who, upon check in, suggested that the best way to get around Lisbon was one of the hop-on / hop-off tour buses, for which she very conveniently sold tickets...but she didn't have a regular bus or metro map. She was a bit less friendly when I declined. The tour buses might be a nice way to see parts of the city, so I don't want to discourage anyone from sightseeing in this manner, but it is sure to be a maddening experience when used as a method of transportation. The metro is easy to get almost anywhere and we used it every day, we took an easy train to Sintra and took an Uber to Belem and the beach. A different receptionist agreed the metro is the way to go. The hotel offered beach towels with a deposit required for each, refunded immediately to us upon our return.Overall, a nice stay and good experience."
Jul 2016,40,Very nice hotel in the heart of everything,The hotel is centrally located in the historic district right in the hustle and bustle of everything. The included breakfast was the best we had all trip. Walking distance to almost anything you wanted to see with access to metro and train with a short walk. Staff spoke great English and they were very informative with maps and directions. My only issue was the size of our room.
Jul 2016,30,It's not Florence!,"This hotel was  pretty expensive for portugal.   I expected a better location, a view from an actual balcony and a good selection of quality ingredients for breakfast.  That's not what we received.  Hotel is crammed in pedesrian zone, view on another building, and baloney for breakfast! The  room was large and centrally located but in florence for the same money we had it all and then some!"
Jul 2016,50,"elegant, impeccable service and luxurious accommodations ","I had a lovely stay at this hotel for five days I enjoyed two dinners at the hotel restaurant. Also some late-night desserts from the room service. The staff were all very nice and helpful, the rooms were clean and beautiful decor. comfortable beds quiet. lovely ceiling showers and the view from the balcony was a main street but no noise. Close to walking areas of shipping and many restaurants. Tram stations were short walk fromhotel which can take you anywhere around Portugal."
Jul 2016,50,"Fantastic location, service, and price.","We stayed for a week at the Hotel Santa Justa.  It is an ideal central location in the older section of Lisbon, with easy public transportation for daytrips and to the airport.  The hotel is on a pedestrian-only street with perhaps 30 outdoor restaurants within 100 yards.  The hotel staff were consistently helpful, polite, and fluent in many languages.  During our stay, we enjoyed a complimentary bottle of port, an in-room espresso machine, and (incredibly) a free mini-bar.  The room AC was superb, and welcome in 95 F summer heat in Lisbon.  We stayed in a lovely, clean, and quiet attic room on the 6th floor, with a great view of the Carmo Convent and the Santa Justa Elevator, but the sloping wall on one side limited the usable space.  Very modern bathroom with a great walk-in shower.  Will definitely stay again next time."
Jul 2016,50,"Great city, very nice hotel","Hotel Santa Justa is a very nice hotel in the great Lisbon. Its location in Baixa Pombalina is superb. It is at walking distance of many attractions and near several good restaurants. Attic rooms are romantic. Linen is immaculate and breakfast is wholesome. However, what most strikes the guest is the kindness of its staff. This is a key feature for coming back to this hotel."
Jul 2016,50,A wonderful boutique hotel perfectly located,"This hotel is as accommodating and welcoming as possible. It is close to the historical sights that make Lisbon such a delightful city. It can be a bit pricey but they do offer deals particularly if you book early or, alternatively if there are rooms, the same day. The rooms are spacious and meticulous. Furthermore, the desk people, particularly Joao and Daniel, will bend over backwards to meet every request. The only drawback, if it is one, is the large number of restaurant hawkers trying to get you to eat at their respective locales just outside, however the centrality of the hotel and the comfort provided by the hotel easily eclipse the sales pitches which you can walk away from. The Santa Justa elevator, providing panoramic views of several plazas and the Tagus river, is nearby and should be experienced after a short wait in line and a modest fee. When in Lisbon, this hotel can't be beat."
Jul 2016,50,Very high service standards!,"We felt taken care of the moment we entered the hotel. The Front desk staff are very warm and welcoming. They were eager to help us navigate the town. Our room was very comfortable with plenty of big bay windows and lots of natural light. The beds were very comfy and...this might seem weird, but the bathroom was wonderful! we loved the floor to ceiling marble, the amazing large tub with jets and rain shower. Our only regret was that we could only stay for two nights. I hope to return someday."
Jul 2016,50,Great Hotel and Location!,"The hotel is in a central location; walking distance to many restaurants, shopping and attractions. Staff at reception are very helpful and friendly. Rooms are spacious (we had family rooms), modern, well kept and very clean. Hotel provided free wi-fi ,minibar and apples at reception. They also left port wine and pastel de natas on arrival...so many nice touches. Would definitely go back on our next visit to Lisbon! Great value!"
Jul 2016,30,ATTIC ROOM...RAIN WILL WAKE YOU UP @ NIGHT!,"Location is perfect.  We were delighted to be shown a room, arriving around 11am. We chose Santa Justa Hotel as it advertises completely sound proofed rooms. We'd requested a QUIET room and were given an attic room next to the noisy beeping elevator. We returned to the front desk explaining we'd rather leave our luggage and return later for a quiet room. We were offered a slightly musty but quiet room next to the staircase and the cheerful housekeeper changed the sheets to make two twin beds while we were out. In Lisbon, it rains at night, and we woke up to the sound of rain pounding down on the metal(?) roof. It was like being in an aluminum garden shed during a downpour. We could hear the occasional siren as well. Otherwise it is clean, modern, strong wifi, a safe and offers a mini-bottle of port and soft-drink and beer filled mini-bar, L'Occitane amenities kit in addition to the toiletry set. We enjoyed a reasonable breakfast at an old-fashioned cafe/pastry shop serving delicious traditional sweets and sandwiches, fresh oj and Portugese coffee at Confeiteria Nacional just down the street. Checking out, we requested help on buying on-line train tickets for Porto, as it switched to Portugese midway and was told it was quite complicated and we should buy tickets at the train station. We requested a taxi but the receptionist directed us to catch one at the Rosso Square taxi stand, a 5 min. walk on cobble-stoned streets away from the train station. From there it was a good 25 min. and 20 Euros to the Santa Apolania train station for Porto. There was no traffic, but it took triple the time the receptionist had told us and the taxi driver tried to drive off with our change and our luggage in the trunk! There was no license plate on the back of the taxi so I couldn't file a complaint.  We then had to queue for 40 minutes to purchase the train tickets so we barely made our train. There are no ticket machines for long-distance trips at the train station, just two people working and over 30 people in line!  The receptionist was kind enough to print out the Lisbon Porto timetable but as there were no other guests at the time, I would've appreciated help booking the train tickets to Porto on-line and having a taxi called."
Jul 2016,50,Great hotel and great location,"We spent 3 nights at the Santa Justa Hotel located in Baixa close to the historical, commercial and business centre of Lisbon. This hotel was superb. The rooms are well appointed, modern and clean. Complimentary mini bar is included in the rate. We had breakfast included and it was good by European standards. The staff were friendly and very helpful. We will definitely stay here again"
Jul 2016,50,"Super centra, quiet and relaxing",Arriving after midnight on a busy summer Saturday an immediate reassuring haven from the bustle of central Lisbon. The location is perfect - a short walk from so much - yet quiet. We were there the night that Portugal won the European football championships when celebrations went on all night yet got a good night's sleep. Facilities and breakfast were good (only slight niggle was the spa bath/shower which was a bit of a struggle to get in or out of).
Jul 2016,50,Great Location...Plus!,"We really liked this hotel! The location is right near Rossio Square and within a block of Rua Augusta, the popular pedestrian shopping street, as well as easy walking distance to the train station and Tram 28. Our room was large and furnished in a sleek, modern style. The bathroom was large with lots of granite. The shower was wonderful, with a large, rain shower head directly above you. The amenities were thoughtful and generous, including the usual plus a toothbrush and paste, disposable razor, sewing kit, plush bathrobes and slippers! We also had a welcome gift in our room of two pastel de matas and a small bottle of port! Breakfast was varied and generous with a pleasant area in the lobby to sit. The AC in the room worked very well and the room was very quite. The staff was very helpful with our questions, helped us get boarding passes for our flight home and arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport. We are looking forward to our next stay here."
Jul 2016,50,"Perfect location, close to the main sites","This is a beautiful and modern hotel in the center of town, walking distance to most sites, and you can see the Santa Justa lift just as you exit the hotel. There are lots of restaurants closeby, as well as lots of shops. Breakfast was nice as well."
Jul 2016,50,All round gem,"This hotel, ticked all the boxes, modern, clean, charming and great staff.The location is excellent close to the main shopping streets, elevator, and harbour. The building is typical of old Lisbon architecture. The interior is chic and modern, nice furnishings and lighting. It has a good bathroom with modern shower. I found the staff very accomodating and happy to book meals etc.. The hotel itself has a nice restaurant and food was very tasty with an appealing drinks menu and cocktails. we had a quiet room with a juiliet balcony, bed was very comfortable and room serviced daily. My only complaint was that empty bottles and used  toiletries were not disposed of daily and this meant the toiletries were not replenished. The location is the trump card."
Jul 2016,50,Grate hotel,",very good hotelnice staff always ready to help,beautiful rooms with free and daily refilled minibaronly downside is the constant sewerage stench coming from the sink in the bathroom..they tried fixing it but I think its a known problem all over lisbon...Not a fun way to start your day but you get use to it.all and all the service was grate, the location was very comfortable, the shower was a lot of fun although it didn't have a stable water temperature and kept changing by itself during the shower from cold to very hot to cold again... Still, one of the best hotels in lisbon."
Jul 2016,50,Best location,"We found ourselves in lisbon for a few days and needed accommodation lucky for us this hotel had a family room available, and what an amazing room it was ! Giant bed for the adults and sofa bed for the children, good size TV, coffee making facilities, fridge stocked with drinks, and JACUZI in bathroom.Lovely doors that opened up to a little balcony with amazing views of the streets below.Very good nights sleep had by all,hotel is very clean, lovely staff very helpful.And the food is really good too .well worth a stay if you ever visit lisbon, close to the square plenty of shops and restaurants everywhere, would definitely recommend."
Jul 2016,50,"Friendly staff, great room and excellent location","The staff were polite, friendly and very helpful. The room was great (double comfort), with a fantastic shower and good facilities. The hotel is situated in the center of the city and closed to the Metro(5 mins walk) and bus and tram routes.I was impressed with the value when i booked, but that seemed like a bargain after our arrival. You could eat well at the hotel, but we preferred to wander around the city and find places. It had a comfortable lounge and good bar."
Jun 2016,50,Simply perfect!,"My sister and I have stayed at Santa Justa last summer and we loved it so much that we are going back this year! The breakfast is really good. The staff is friendly and helpful. The staff at the reception helped us book two memorable excursions. The rooms are clean and nicely appointed! The hotel is also at a 5-10 minute walk to the river Tagus and we would walk by the river after dinner and eat an ice cream from a typical italian gelateria Davvero (in chiado district). Also, there are many restaurants on the street of the hotel and surrounding streets.  All in all everything is perfect about this hotel! Definitely recommend!"
Jun 2016,50,Excellent location. Modern rooms. Helpful staff. Lovely!,"We took a 2-bedroom suite which was basically 2 connected rooms - one large and one standard sized. The large room was very spacious while the standard sized was very reasonable by Europe standards. Fittings and furnishings were all modern/new-ish. WiFi was speedy and consistent.Proper shower cubicle in a spacious toilet.The staff was helpful and spoke excellent English. Little nice touches everywhere.Location is excellent. At the top end of the Baixa area, adjacent to the Figueira and Rossio squares. The Chiado area and the main shopping street is less than 5-10 minutes away on foot. Castelo de San Jorge about 20 minutes away on foot. Basically, you can walk to almost every attraction in the city center."
Jun 2016,50,Perfect hotel in the city center,"Hotel is perfectly situated in the city center. Still it is quite to sleep since it's located on a pedestrian street, but not to far to walk in by foot coming from the Metro Station Rossioor with the airport buss. Loved the the room decoration including a spacious bathroom. Nice extra was the Nesspresso machine and the minibar which was actually for free. I have learnt this only when chick out, wanting to pay my extras. The personnel at reception was very friendly and even brought me the welcome porto and pastel de nat into my new room, because I had asked to change the room due to some generator next to the staff room on the roof floor. Compliment for a perfect hotel and service. Will come back next time"
Jun 2016,50,"Really lovely hotel, fantastic staff","My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights in June and we couldn't have found fault with anything if we'd tried. From check-in to check-out our experience was fantastic. We had a really lovely room and one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept on. Very central location but excellent sound-proofed balcony door cancelling all noise from the bustling pedestrian street below. The staff are really friendly, professional and attentive. The cleanliness was absolutely faultless and the attention to detail really made it for us; Nespresso machine, Netflix, little bottle of port & custard tarts in the room. We would highly recommend this hotel."
Jun 2016,50,Book here with no regrets ,"Truly a star! Based on others reviews we booked 4 nights here. I won't wax on lyrically about the 'standard' nice things about this hotel. Instead, here are the little things that made it one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. Smiling staff (all the time!), helpful without being overbearing or condescending, free juice/water/beer, welcome gift, washing line, scales, iron and ironing board, full length mirror, washing sponge, decent hairdryer, 2 seats and a table but still room for our luggage, Nespresso machine, black out curtains, insanely quiet (1st floor, by the lift, centre of city - didn't hear a thing!). Most important for goldilocks here, a great bed! Thank you HSJ for our lovely stay. Anyone reading this should consider staying here, it ticks so many boxes."
Jun 2016,50,Great Breakfast / Great Location / Modern & beautiful rooms,"Delicious breakfast.Great location to reach all the best touristic sites of Lisbon.Great modern, beautiful and quiet rooms (404).The staff was really nice with us.We didn't regret this choice and we do recommend it!"
Jun 2016,40,Great hotel in an excellent location for seeing central Lisbon,"We booked after reading numerous reviews, and the Santa Justa proved to be an excellent choice as it is a stones throw from Rossio and Figueria squares where you have a metro station, trams and tour buses, but is on a pedestrianised street. We had a first floor room but could hear no noise from outside, despite arriving on the festival of St Antony when seemingly all of Lisbon were on the streets.First impression of the room were that it was very 'designer' with low lighting (not always great when you want to see what you're doing) and a bathroom with walk in shower with rainfall shower head (lovely, but impractical if you don't want to get your hair wet). We tended to use the hand held shower head but a wall holder at a higher level would be helpful. The wardrobe and bathroom shared a sliding door, so you had to check you weren't going to hit someone when coming out of the bathroom. All minor points, but attention to them would be helpful. The breakfast was excellent. A very good assortment of fresh fruit, breads, meats, cheeses and smoked salmon, pasties, including the little custard tarts. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the 'welcome' bottle of tawny port and custard tarts was a lovely touch after a stressful trip from the airport. The free minibar was also very welcome. All in all, a great little hotel in an excellent location, highly recommended."
Jun 2016,50,Perfect,"Just came back from a trip to Lisbon and I am glad we stayed here. First of, compliments to the staff and the service. The friendly staff was very helpful and had no trouble answering all the questions and giving more details and tips. Also my friend had his birthday and when we came back to the room they've provided champagne and delicious pastries. That was a really nice surprise and thoughtful, like the port on our first night.We stayed in an attic room, which was really nice but next time I'll go for a bigger room. The room is modern, has a great shower and is well equipped with a big TV, coffee maker, free mini-bar and wi-fi all making our stay a very pleasant one. Great location right in the centre and with various metro stations and tram lines close by makes it a perfect hotel to explore big parts of Lisbon. I will definitely stay at this hotel on my next visit to Lisbon. Our stay was perfect!"
Jun 2016,50,Perfect Hotel,"This hotel was a gem. It is ideally located within the city.  Public transportation (metro, trains) and wonderful restaurants are right around the corner. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The room was fresh and clean. They even had port and pastries for us in the room upon arrival. I will definitely stay here again when  we return to Lisbon!"
Jun 2016,50,"Great location, service, and price!","As other reviewers have noted, HSJ is well located near restaurants, shopping, transportation and sights.  The front desk staff is knowledgeable and helpful in several different languages.  The room was spacious and clean, the bathroom was as well.  I ate one dinner at the hotel which was average.  There are many nice restaurants close by, check Trip Advisor for suggestions."
Jun 2016,50,Amazing,"Charming,newly restored central hotel in a modern fashion.Modern furniture,clean,smart tv.I enjoyed a luxurious 5th floor suite ;for a couple and a kid a real wonder!The upto date bathroom amenities were super ,included a mini jacuzzi.Courtesy and dedication by the personnel completed an amazing accommodation."
Jun 2016,40,"winning location, staff and room","Our room was large, plush, quiet and comfortable. The staff was friendly, professional, welcoming, very helpful. All spoke English - and kindly tolerated our attempts at Portuguese.The location was close enough to the harbor, and the galleries, shops and restaurants of Chiado to easily walk. If you wanted to get away from the bustle of this predominantly touristy location, there were metro stops nearby, and the staff was always happy to share an insiders tip for dining or sightseeing.We have not one complaint, and would highly recommend Santa Justa to friends."
May 2016,50,"great location, staff and stay","We spent 4 nights in Lisbon at this hotel. The hotel is situated on a pedestrian only street so is very quiet. The staff are very helpful, all English speaking. The room was really lovely, large by European standards, and after our very long journey in, the shower was incredibly good, the towels really soft and there was a complimentary bottle of tawny port with chocolates. :)The location was perfect for us. Just blocks from the water, good restaurants and cafes, pretty small shops. Easy access to the tram, and half a block to where you could pick up a cab. We pretty much walked everywhere!We had picked the hotel off of the Trip Advisor site and were very very happy."
May 2016,50,Excellent Hotel with best location,"I just returned from my Portugal trip and stayed at HSJ for 5 wonderful nights, location is the best you may have in the city center - just a walk to all major attractions, metro station (Rossio) is 3 min walk, Praca Figueira is right there where you can take tram 28 or tram 15E to Belem or yellow bus city tour, make sure to visit historical Confeitaria Nacional for a good coffee and pastry. We had a quit superior room on 5th floor with a great big bathroom, the bed is so comfortable, you will have everything in the room that you need during your stay - free minibar (water, juice, beer), coffee espresso. They even provide with umbrella on a rainy day.  I'd recommend to stay at this hotel to anybody who is looking for a good location luxury stay at very affordable price."
May 2016,50,"""Outstanding Hotel""","I picked this from the Internet and the pictures tell the truth! Beautiful rooms, clean, modern, in the center of town, walking distance to almost everything in Lisbon. The staff was warm, friendly and recommended excellent places to eat! I would highly recommend it..Dr. Sandra"
May 2016,50,Great Stay,"What a lovely hotel.  The location was terrific.  A great starting point every day for tours, transportation, dining and shopping.  The staff were all welcoming and very helpful.  I would not hesitate to return."
May 2016,50,Pleasure sightseeing,"Great location and pleasant mid-sized hotel. Reasonable price, staff very helpful.Room very clean and hotel dining terrific. Shopping available and within walking distance in either of 2 major public squares. A little distance from airport but not excessively so. Only time we needed a taxi.Trams handy for sightseeing. Train station nearby for out of town excursions.Staff all spoke English well and publicly people very friendly in shops etc"
May 2016,50,Ticks ALL the boxes!,"Everyone wants a hotel that ticks all the boxes and this hotel does just that! Rare indeed! Perfect location, in the middle of everything yet quiet too, roomy rooms, well designed interiors, fab shower and wifi, good restaurant.... best of all were Claudia and Pedro who were the best welcome anyone could have to fabulous Lisbon."
May 2016,50,Ideal location,"Really nice hotel - room, staff, breakfast etc all first class but main reason I would stay there again is the location - virtually everything in walking distance from river one way to castle the other plus metro station about 5min walk away. Restaurants in the same road hassled us to eat with them but common in rest of city so got used to it. Cars not allowed in the actual road (plus point overall) but taxi from airport took us to next road and driver insisted on taking cases right into hotel - similar on return journey- came into hotel to collect us.Evening meal in hotel bit pricey compared to nearby restaurants but good standard; daily cocktail happy hour & complimentary afternoon tea & cake. Breakfast everything I wanted - fruit, cheese, meats & pastries plus cooked for those who prefer. Staff happy to help - good to be able to access airline check in, print boarding passes etc. Would definitely stay again."
May 2016,50,Very good hotel! Excellent location! Excellent service!,"We spent six nights at Hotel Santa Justa in Lisbon. We had a marvelous time. The people at the hotel were very friendly and professional, ever-ready to help and to recommend restaurants and places to visit. In particular, we wish to mention three people at the desk: Pedro, Claudia and Ricardo. They were exceptionally kind and helpful. The hotel's location is excellent. The room was very clean, comfortable and silent. Breakfast was good, but with relatively limited variety of food available. We also had dinner at the hotel on two different occasions. The food was very good. We highly recommend it!"
May 2016,50,"Friendly staff, ideal location and good food","Was impressed by the friendly, cheery attitude of the staff that seemed to be speaking to one customer in English, next in French, next in German, next in Portugese - and laughing with them all.Location was excellent for Lisbon. We were in a Superior Double which was good. Bathroom and shower were fantastic but bedroom was a little dim despite copious number of low wattage lights! Still nice though. View from room was not brilliant – hotel is in a narrow street with lots of buildings nearby. That said the soundproofing was excellent and 5 good night’s sleep were had in a very comfortable bed.We arrived in Lisbon in early May hoping for some sunshine (we live about 2000km north!). It poured rain and we never saw the sun! However that made us reluctant to search for restaurants with character & good food and we ended up eating in the hotel twice during our five nights. Food was really good! In fact it was better than any of the other 3 that we ate at.Breakfast was good as well if a little chaotic when busy.Overall we were slightly disappointed with Lisbon (might have been weather) but the hotel made up for it – no hesitation in recommending it."
May 2016,40,Nice boutique hotel in a central location,"I stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa for a couple of nights in Lisbon prior to a business trip.  It was a little tricky to find at first as it is located on a primarily pedestrian street.  My cab driver dropped me off a couple of blocks away and then pointed me in the general direction.  Luckily, I found a nice police officer that helped me find it.  Once there, I found it to be very nice and once I got my bearings, it was easy to find my way back.  This was a great hotel in central Lisbon."
Apr 2016,50,Fantastic Restaurant,I happened by this hotel as I was walking in the old district downtown and thought it looked like a nice place to sit. I ordered a glass of red wine which was nice and just enjoyed the ambiance. I had two more glasses of wine which were good and reasonably priced and then noticed a couple at the next table having a meal that looked quite good. It was duck - Magret Pato - and so I ordered the same. The duck was actually rare which I had not had before and it was excellent. It was in a very nice dark sauce and the meat was very tender. It came with mashed Celerac which I had also not had before which was quite tasty. Anyway the service was good and the waiters friendly. Overall an excellent experience.
Apr 2016,40,Great location near old town,"We took the Aerobus from the airport and alighted at the stop near the old town. The hotel is just a short walk away and near the famous elevator attraction site. It is also a short walking distance away from the major sights in the old town. Free Nespresso provided in the room and small touches such as complimentary egg tarts, Port and tea- time snacks were much appreciated. Although the streets beneath may be noisy, the windows have relatively good sound-proofing. Plenty of eatery and cafes in the area to choose from, although we didn't dine nearby. We bought pastries from the cafes nearby while walking to the train station for our day trips."
Apr 2016,40,Great deal in the heart of the old city.,"This was a great experience. I don't need too much from a hotel when I'm exploring a city. My main concerns are location and cleanliness and this place delivered much more than that. Very reasonably priced in an European city which is cheaper than I'm regularly used to. The staff was marvelous, very attentive and I really don't know how many languages they spoke as it looked like more than three. I certainly recommend it and will stay again when I go back to the beautiful city of Lisbon."
Apr 2016,30,"Okay, but not great","Location is very good, right in the middle of everything. As others have mentioned, there are lots of people on the street outside trying to get you into their restaurants. Ignoring them works just fine, though.The bed was comfy and we got plenty of pillows. The room was spacious, but dark (even with all the lights on). We had a whirlpool bathtub, which was very difficult to get into (and you had to in order to take a shower) - even though I am young and able-bodied. The towels smelled a bit when they got wet, like they hadn't been dried properly. One had a few stains on.Breakfast was alright, but a bit sparse - and people are overworked, so you had to wait for things to get filled up or tables to be cleared. Very crowded after nineish, more pleasant earlier.You can hear people in the adjacent rooms, but nothing from outside (we were on the fourth floor)."
Apr 2016,50,Best hotel right in center of town,"Our best hotel during our entire trip.Centrally located, very luxurious feel in all the touches.  Free Nespresso coffee, wonderful breakfast buffet including fresh cheeses and smoked salmon.Roolm was very modern with wonderful glass shower.  Wifi was amazing with 40 mbs speed!Would highly recommend!"
Apr 2016,50,Good value and spotless clean,"We stayed here for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  All of the reception staff were friendly and helpful, the room and bathroom were of a high standard and spotless clean.  There were nice little touches like a free minibar of soft drinks, an espresso machine and a welcome gift in the room. The breakfast buffet was also of a high standard with plenty of food to suit all tastes including eggs, bacon, cereals, toast, pastries and continental cheese and meat.  The only slight downside was our one evening meal in the restaurant (we ate out every other night).  The food was average at best and the service was poor due to a number of mistakes with our order which we were blamed for.  So in summary, a lovely hotel to stay, just don't eat in the restaurant in the evening."
Apr 2016,50,Perfectly located and exactly what you need when visiting Lisbon,A good solid 4 star hotel. Rooms were clean and spacious with comfortable beds. We were a family with two small children. The kids had a good quality sofa bed and we had a super king bed. Superb bathroom with jacuzzi bath and 'rainforest shower'. Very good selection of toiletries. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. From the front door there are a huge number of restaurants to choose from. The tourist attraction lift is about 100 metres away and the main square less than that. Perfect. Some advise is that Rue de Santa Justa is a pedestrian street and so is Rua dos Correeiros so you need to get out a taxi and walk down Rua de Santa Justa to the hotel. It's not far though - 30 metres or so. Overall I can certainly recommend Hotal Santa Justa.
Apr 2016,50,Excellent hotel in great location,"We have just come back from a 4-night trip and stayed in this hotel that we found on trip adviser. The first thing is when arriving by cab or any transport there is a short 50 meter walk to the hotel. The hotel itself has very friendly and well prepared reception staff who are always smiling and ready to help with recommendations and requests. The room itself, we had a superior room on the first floor was quite, large and clean. We were provided with a welcome gift of custard tarts and a bottle of port and the mini bar is free and re stocked daily, loved the extra-large and hot rain shower! The Wi-Fi is excellent, free with a simple login. We did not eat at the hotel. The location is fantastic, smack in the middle of Lisbon, you could not ask for anything more."
Apr 2016,50,4 star hotel deserving of a 5 star rating,"From check in to check out, everything was smooth and no hustle. The location is centre to most of the places we wanted to visit in Lisbon. The hotel is clean and the staff are very polite and extremely helpful. I have to mention, Antonio, Arthur, Claudia, Daniel, Tainna and all staff for their excellent service. I would  highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay again if ever we will visit Lisbon in the future... 👍"
Apr 2016,50,Deserves more than a 4 star rating,"Excellent all throughout, from location, service and staff. All the staff would do all their best to accomodate your request and would take their time listening and attending to any queries, have to mention and thank Antonio, Claudia, Arthur, Tainna, Daniel and all the staff who made us feel at home... Food in their restaurant is reasonably priced, good portion and tasty... We were given 10% discount on our lunch eventhough we have already checked out and complimentary pasta de nata... Keep up the good work guys👍"
Apr 2016,40,Good location. Friendly staff.,"This place is perfectly located in the heart of old Lisbon. Lots of things to see at walking distance and easy access to transit for the more distant spots. Staff was very friendly. The receptionist, Claudia, gave us great tips about how to get around the city, where to eat, and what not to miss. Will come back to this hotel."
Apr 2016,50,Ideal location,"Stayed for 3 nights in April. As other reviewers have said, it's a great hotel in a perfect location for restaurants, the river,  tourist attractions and the metro.  Also close to the main station to Sintra (return ticket less than 5 euros each).  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  Would happily stay there again."
Apr 2016,50,Heart of Lisbon,"I recently stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa and what a fantastic hotel this was!  This hotel is in the heart of the city a short walk away from Rossio Square.  Even better, the area is full of sights, restaurants, cafes and boutique shops.  When there you feel a part of the local community.  The bus and train run regularly and there are places for tourist information and bus tours right in Rossio Square.  The hotel is perfect for everyone from the business traveler, to the touring singles and families.  My room was on the 4th floor with a balcony facing the main street and I must say it was a delight to stand on the balcony day and night and watch the hustle and bustle of the city life below.  It really gave a good feel of life in Portugal.  The hotel room was pristine.  I was welcomed with a bottle of port wine and pastries.  Every day the hotel staff greeted me and were extremely helpful with information about the city.  I highly recommend this hotel.  I Am very pleased and happy that I read the trip advisor reviews and decided on this hotel."
Apr 2016,50,A perfect spot,"This hotel is perfectly placed to explore Lisbon - check in was simple enough, rooms were well appointed and comfortable. Shower was really good. A small bottle of port and chocolates were nice treats. Breakfast had all we wanted and was good quality. Particularly helpful was the use of umbrellas - well done to all of the staff at HSJ."
Apr 2016,50,Wonderful management and staff,"We stayed here for a few days at the start of our Portugal trip. Great location, good breakfast, nice staff. Everything as it should be. So we booked again at the end of our trip, as we returned to Lisbon.  To our surprise the management left a gift in our room as a thank you for our return. Very classy. Highly recommend."
Apr 2016,50,"Perfect location, rooms and breakfast!","This hotel is very conveniently located in the heart of Lisbon. They had unexpensive parking to leave our car, which was also convenient.The rooms were tidy, clean and very well designed. You could choose among many different lighting combinations and the shower was delightful. Minibar drinks included in price? YES! Nespresso machine with 2 pods also included? YESSS!!!Then, breakfast was so good I still miss it every morning. Maybe too few hot options but the Iberico ham was so good that I would not have eaten anything else. Fruits were very fresh, Portuguese bakery is amazing (in almost every hotel in the country). And the coffee was delicious.The staff was so attentive and friendly as well. The Wi-Fi was fast and reliable. Overall, one of the best hotels I have ever been to."
Apr 2016,50,Great Hotel in a Perfect Location,"We loved everything about this hotel.  From the moment we arrived the hotel staff was great, very friendly and helpful.  The room was large, nice and modern without being stark and spotlessly clean.  The breakfast in the morning was great with plenty of good options.  The location can not be beat located right on a quiet pedestrian only street yet in the center of everything.  Walkable to all the major attractions, restaurants and very close to a main Metro stop.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again."
Mar 2016,50,"Good location, clean, accommodating and very friendly","My husband and I were pleased with location as was safe and  easily accessible to transportation and shops. The hotel is clean, and the staff are all very friendly. This is the first hotel where they offer you items in the mini bar for free such as an orange juice, water or even a beer. As it is close to Easter, they offer you colored Easter eggs as well as green apples. We had many questions and requested some phone calls to be made and all were made with a smile. Each person made an effort to be professional. Daniel is very kind, speaks great English and can put on even a southern accent for you!! He is precious with a good sense of humor. Joao was very kind and always smiling as well!! They both were extra approachable and accommodating. As a tourist, I always appreciate people with extra patience."
Mar 2016,50,Service with a smile,"My wife and I visited Lisbon for a long weekend and this hotel was just right for us.This boutique hotel is perfectly situated in the centre of the old town and with easy access to trams and taxis. Our room was modern and clean and even had UK as well as European electrical sockets. The owners eem to be very particular about ensuring that everything is well though out for guests to enjoy their stay.The staff could not be more accommodating and welcoming. We received a welcome port and cakes and the free mini bar meant we could get water and a beer whenever we wanted.Breakfast was first rate with fresh orange juice, excellent coffee and the cakes............Wholeheartedly recommended."
Mar 2016,40,Excellent in every way,"Spent four nights here, and it was just perfect . Central, easy for all travel on bus, train, metro and taxi's. Brilliant area of old town, with loads eateries and things to see and do. We walked everywhere. The airport bus is only a few hundred metres away too. Staff at the hotel were friendly helpful and professional. We ate in the hotel the first night, as we arrived late and tired. It was very good, as was the breakfast. Small bar/ lounge area but it all worked well. Definitely use this one again."
Mar 2016,50,Fantastic location,"I visited for 3 nights with a friend. Location was perfect, right in the centre and close to transport links. The staff were helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and clean with a lovely bathroom."
Mar 2016,40,Great place to stay,"We chose this hotel for it's central location - trams, buses & metro literally just round the corner, and within walking distance of most of the main tourist sights. Our room was very comfortable, meals and service were good, and if you want to eat out it's a only few steps from many restaurants and cafes."
Mar 2016,50,Perfect in one word!!!,"I couldn't find a problem with this hotel even if I wanted to. I chose this hotel based on the reviews I had read on Trip Advisor and it did not disappoint. The location is perfect. It is walking distance to buses, trams, metro, and all the attractions. We took the metro from the airport to the hotel, which was cheap, fast, and the station was about 3 min away from the hotel. Upon arrival, there were a welcome card, a small bottle of port, and a couple of Portuguese custards awaiting us in the room, which I thought that was a fabulous gesture. The room was spotlessly clean and was a good size compared to the other European hotel rooms that we've been to. The shower was fantastic and modern. The room included a Krups espresso maker. The staff was super helpful and friendly. By the way, the free wi-fi was the fastest I've ever experienced in any hotels anywhere!! I highly recommend this hotel. For the price we paid, I couldn't possibly ask for anything better!"
Feb 2016,50,"Location, location, location",Situated only meters from the central Rossio square is just ideal for a tourist. Start of the open top bus tour only minutes away this really is the place to stay. Spacious rooms with a very generous bathroom. Querky door for the bathroom and cupboard but no issues with it. Rooms always cleaned thoroughly every morning. Despite being on the door step of the Rossio square it is suffentiantly tucked away that it is quiet at night and away from the rowdy tourists!! Staff all very friendly and very willing to help especially in providing umbrellas when raining. Would definitely stay here again if I was in Lisbon again!
Feb 2016,50,Lovely hotel in a great location,"A cheeky surprise few days away for my husbands 50th birthday, and I couldn't have chosen better! From booking to leaving, we found all staff very friendly and helpful. The email received after booking was a lovely touch and further email correspondence to confirm the correct metro route was no issue either and was quickly responded to. The room was very clean, and the cakes and bottle of port a lovely touch too. We were even surprised with a birthday cake and small bottle of champagne to say happy birthday. Thank you for making this a great stay. We will definitely return."
Feb 2016,40,Great Hotel in the Centre of Lisbon,Superb central Lisbon hotel right in the heart of the action. Very welcoming and warm staff and nice comfortable rooms. Hotel is obviously very popular as it is heart of the town and offer good value and service. Just step out and in you are in the main streets of the centre for lots of restaurants and shops - all very vibrant.Hotel room was nice size with free wifi and a free fridge bar - they also do nice breakfasts and good value evening meals - although there is so much on offer outside you probably will want to explore. Hotel is also moments away from the various tram and bus routes that help you reach the other sights of Lisbon - all of which are very accessible.The main airport bus is just a two minute walk from the hotel which again adds to the convenienceWould definitely return
Feb 2016,50,Great Location,"Perfect place to stay for visiting Lisbon, right in the centre of the old town.  Within easy walking distance of lots of the main attractions.  Trams, buses and metro very close to get you further afield.  The hotel staff are all very friendly and helpful, nothing was to much trouble.  Our rom 207 was fine, the bathroom a good size with a great shower, all very clean.  Breakfast was ok and the evening meals we had were good.  Would certainly stay there again."
Feb 2016,50,Excellent location and friendly helpful staff,"The Hotel Santa Justa offered us a very warm and friendly welcome to our stay there. the staff were always so friendly and helpful. We had requested a room with a balcony but we didn't get offered this, However the room was wonderful and spacious, with an enormous comfy bed and a Jacuzzi bath (room 502) the location was perfect and very central. We had breakfast one morning in the hotel which was your standard continental but fresh and satisfying, plenty to choose from- would definitely stay here again and have already recommended to friends and family."
Feb 2016,40,"Good hotel, centrally placed","We stayed here for four days on our first trip to Lisbon. This is a good hotel in a pedestrian street in Baixa - the city centre. Good rooms - we were on the 6th floor - kept nicely and efficiently cleaned (quite late in the day). We tried the restaurant one evening. The food was good and the waitress charming. Only one suggestion for a slight improvement - we could have done with a bit more light in the room. Its probably alright if the sun's shining, but on grey rainy days its a bit dark, even with all lights on.We would recommend Hotel Santa Justa to others and will stay there again when we go back. And Lisbon is definitely worth more than one visit.A good stay. Thanks to the staff who were always smiling and charming and a special thanks to the charming waitress who wants to be (and already performs like) an actress."
Feb 2016,40,Good location and helpful staff,Stayed for 5 nights in Feb 2016 in a superior room.  Great central location but very quiet ( room 302 on 3rd floor). Food at breakfast and dinner good and some nice touches with port and pastries in room on day of arrival. Staff were all helpful and friendly. There were however some negatives. Bath and shower were difficult to access despite our being relatively fit and agile. Room quite dark. Also room can be cleaned quite late in the day unless otherwise requested. However still a nice hotel for a relaxing break in central Lisbon.
Feb 2016,40,Great Property in a Wonderful location in Lisbon,Great hotel!  Really liked the location and the sites around the hotel.  The staff was excellent....very friendly and engaging.  Found the people to be helpful and provided insights on local attractions.
Feb 2016,50,All-around amazing,"My husband and I visited Lisbon over Valentine's Day. This was our first trip to Lisbon, and Hotel Santa Justa made it that much more memorable and enjoyable. The staff are, I believe, some of the friendliest people to ever work in hospitality. They went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and comfortable. Upon entering our room, we were blown away by the design and layout. The bathroom/WC had high-end fixtures including a rainfall shower head and a floor-to-ceiling window looking into the bedroom, which had switch-operated blinds to open and close (sexy!). Our room was on the second level and had a small balcony. It had a minibar which we could help ourselves to at no extra cost - Coke, juice, water, and even beer! There was also a small bottle of Porto, two glasses, two pastel de natas and a welcome card on the table the first day we arrived. The room had everything we needed - iron, hairdryer, bottle opener, TV with English-speaking channels, even EU, UK, and US outlets! The location was brilliant, walking distance to all the attractions we wanted to visit. Thank you for a great stay, Hotel Santa Justa. We hope to be back!"
Feb 2016,50,"Terrific Hotel, Great Staff, Awesome Location","We were in Lisbon for two days and had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Santa Justa, which we found online.The staff were some of the best- they were informative, pleasant and responsive. They helped us identify two great restaurants (owned by the same person) in the area and booked our taxi for the return trip to the airport. They also welcomed us with Tawny Port and Pastelas...a very nice treat. I would very highly recommend this stylish and centrally located hotel. The staff really sets them apart as well."
Feb 2016,50,Great place!,"Absolutely remarkable place! Clean (thank you Cristina), very welcoming, with great staff! Everybody was so nice and helpful, couldn't ask for more! A beautiful experience in Lisbon! Can't wait to go back!"
Feb 2016,50,Best experience!,I had a great time at Santa Justa hotel! Awesome stuff and condicions ! The employees were very polite and i enjoyed every moment during my staying. Greetings for the stuff and muito obrigado ! :) PS : I'll gladly return and certaintly i will choose again Hotel Santa Justa !
Feb 2016,50,Good location and customer atention,"Very good customer atention and excelent location.  Hotel staff really helpful and kind. Definetely a good option if you travel to Lisboa. Tidy and cleam rooms, nice cafeteria and enjoyable breakfast and lunch. Recommended."
Feb 2016,50,Great stay at this fantastic hotel. Well done to the staff!!!,"when i booked the hotel I received an email saying thank you for choosing them. Their appreciation continued throughout our stay, but never felt forced. When we arrived we were greeted by a lovely lady who wanted to assist in any way she could. The room was chic and the little welcome treats were a lovely touch. The free mini bar had 1 beer but plenty of water, juices and cokes. There was a nespresso machine in the room too. The bathroom and bedroom areas were spotlessly clean. We didn't eat dinner at the hotel but the breakfast was a great spread with lots of fresh fruit and cheeses, pastries and hot food which were replenished as needed, not having stood for 3 hours, so it was all fresh.it was in a fantastic location, and although the road outside the hotel is closed during the day to cars, it was not a long way nor was it hard to walk with cases to the hotel."
Feb 2016,50,Love it,"I loved this hotel! really enjoyed everything about it.The rooms are confortable, the location is amazing and breakfast is lovely.Staff is also very friendly and the hotel is very clean.The restaurante also serves dinner which I found very tasty. I ate there once and the food was very nice."
Feb 2016,50,A must stay,Hotel was great. Located right on a corner makes it easy to find with interesting views. People were very friendly. We particularly enjoyed the great breakfast. Check in and nice gift of local pastries as a welcome was an extra We haven't seen before. Walkable to most everything. Special stay in a top class hotel.
Feb 2016,50,Perfection,"Couldn't ask for more from this hotel. Bright, clean and stylish room and bathroom. A nice touch was the knock on the door 15 minutes after we checked in with a free glass of sherry and a local custard tart. Also the water and soft drinks in the minibar were free too!Great location 2 minutes walk from the Santa Justa elevator and the same distance from the Rossio metro station. I would avoid the breakfast at 15 euros each - you can get much cheaper and better at local cafes."
Feb 2016,50,"Great location, great staff, great hotel!","I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Lisbon. It offered very good value for money considering the location and standard of the hotel. We stayed 4 nights and couldn't fault it. When we arrived early at 10am we were able to check in to our room no problem and the room was amazing- big luxury shower, a balcony, free mini bar refilled daily and a welcome gift bottle of port, a lovely touch! The staff were helpful from the start and the hotel is only a 2-3 minute walk from a lovely big square overlooking the water. We didn't eat at the hotel but had drinks on an evening and would highly recommend one of their gin & tonics served in a proper gin glass with a variety of garnishes. Overall a great experience and helped make our trip to Lisbon so special!"
Jan 2016,50,Excellent hotel!,"We had a flawless stay at Hotel Santa Justa. Everything was perfect. The location couldn't be better or easier. Our room was spacious and comfortable, and the complimentary Pastéis de Nata on arrival were such a nice touch! A big thank you to the very friendly and professional staff!"
Jan 2016,50,"Very well located, 5* Staff","This hotel is very well located in the heart of the beautiful city Lisbon. Rooms are great and wide. Feels clean and tidy everywhere. Great breakfast and the staff is very helpful, always ready to give you the best advises and to attend to all your needs! Will definitely come back."
Jan 2016,50,Lovely hotel in a great location,"Stayed here for 2 nights mid January, reception staff were very helpful and friendly at check in. Fantastic room, comfy bed and amazing shower! Location was perfect for everything, plenty of restaurants, shops, bars and sights within walking distance. Would definitely recommend to any couples travelling to Lisbon! Only wish we'd have stayed longer and given the hotel restaurant a try. A Nata each in the room on arrival was a lovely touch! Many thanks!"
Jan 2016,40,Very nice property,"I had a suite which was very roomy. The hotel is a five minute walk to where the tour hop on hop off tours are. It is a ten minute walk to the water front. The nice thing about the hotel is that it is a pedestrian street, very little car noise on the other streets.  The room it self was very clean, the staff were helpful."
Jan 2016,50,"Great 'City', but not 'Street' location","The property is fantastic.  Service is outstanding and very helpful.  The hallways are decorated in a great theme and the rooms are well maintained.  They feature live music a few nights downstairs at the lobby bar.  But it's worth noting, the hotel is located along a busy side street, featuring touristy restaurants with aggressive hosts trying to lure you into their establishments, the minute you step outside the hotel.  Because the hotel is on a pedestrian street, there are certain hours where taxis are permitted to drive the corridor.  So keep in mind, you may need to walk with your luggage a block or two.  Otherwise, fantastic stay and we would return."
Dec 2015,50,Best hotel,"We stayed for 5 nights and enjoyed the hotel tremendously. Everyone was friendly, the rooms were fantastic. It was centrally located at the heart of the city. Buses and tram was in walking distance.I recommend this hotel 100%."
Dec 2015,40,"Lovely Hotel, Perfect location!","The hotel is lovely, modern, with clean  well appointed rooms. We had a superior double room- we intentionally did not book the attic rooms based on TA reviews, the room was large and comfy, exactly like the photos. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly, even sending a bottle of champagne when we mentioned it was our anniversary!  We booked the breakfast, and while,there are places around we found the varied selection and amount of offerings well worth it! The best part is the location, Lisbon is a wonderful walking city and you couldn't be better positioned for exploring. Highly recommend this hotel."
Dec 2015,40,December in Lisbon,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Hotel very well located, staff really helpful. Rooms well equipped. Only thing worth being aware of the ""city view attic rooms"" - you would need the neck of a giraffe to see the city properly. Not a big deal, good hotel and would stay there again"
Dec 2015,50,Sleek and Modern,"Excellent location near all the popular sites, hop on hop off buses, restaurants and  shops. Spacious clean room with sleek shower. Good amenities and toiletries. In the heart of seven hills of Lisbon. We will gladly recommend this hotel to our friends."
Dec 2015,40,"Good location, well appointed rooms","The hotel is well located but can be difficult to accessed as it is on a pedestrianised street and cars would have limited access. It is accessible to cars at certain times of the day and if arriving with lots of luggage, you might wish to work around those times. Rooms were nice with a comfortable marble bathrooms. Service at the reception was somewhat indifferent and could be high handed, especially surprising as we had received warm and friendly service almost everywhere else we travelled in Portugal. I must however credit the hotel for a goodwill gesture that they extended - they reduced my prepaid, non refundable rates to match the latest rates they were offering, upon my request. Clearly no legal obligation to do so, hence it was much appreciated."
Dec 2015,50,Perfect location and brilliant staff!,"Just stayed at Hotel Santa Justa Lisbon for few days and couldnt have found best place to enjoy this beautiful city! It has all the main attractions just nearby at a walking distance and the staff are always available to help you out showing the best places to visit. I found the room very functional and always perfectly clean and tidy. Ideal relation between price and quality. Will happily recommend it to everyone as I felt so welcomed and will be coming back for sure as I already miss the warm and genuine smiles from all the staff! That is what really makes the difference when you look for a place to stay, and that is what makes you remember it!"
Dec 2015,40,"Convenient to everything, clean and with very friendly staff","Holiday with older children in adjoining rooms optimally and fairly separate, high-quality services also in accessories. In a central position, excellent starting point for visiting the city, top-quality restaurant with prices well rapportati quality and quantity."
Dec 2015,40,"Pleasant hotel with walking distance to the train station, many attractions, points of interest, shopping and nightlife","We decided to stay hotel based on recommendations in tripadvisor and we glad we have done so. The hotel location is ideal.The hotel and rooms design is modern and very nice.We enjoyed the gratis welcoming of the traditional pastries, bottle of port and chocolates in the room when we checked in.The room was clean and had a convenient shower room with a cool shower head.The breakfast area was very pleasant and the food variety was  good.The reception desk team was very friendly and helpfull. Thanks to their recommendation  we have enjoyed two lovely nights of FADO musicin O Faia in Bairro Alto and in Parreirinha de Alfama.There are two thing we recommend to improve:1. The room lighting is not sufficient. 2. There is not much of a closet free space to put the cloths especially if staying for couple of days or more."
Dec 2015,30,all about location,"hi guys,hotel is located in the heart of the city 2 steps from Rossio and everything arround it.Pros.locationbathroom with rainshower tap.staff is very nice and trying to helpconsroom is very darkMattress- we have asked to replace it as we slept very bad, it seems that they did not as our sleeping quality did not change"
Dec 2015,50,Perfect location. Great Staff. Wonderful stay.,"This boutique hotel was a perfect home base for us during our week in Lisbon. The location is perfect; safe and within walking distance to many sites, shopping and transportation. Our room was small by US standards, but comfortable once we unpacked and got suitcases out of the way. It has a mini-fridge that is stocked with complimentary beverages. In-room coffee was good. (Nepresso machine.) We received a welcome gift of local pastries and Port. Housekeeping was very accommodating to our jet-lag! The desk staff were wonderful at helping with restaurant suggestions, directions and arranging transportation. (See my review about IGo Portugal.) We didn't eat at the restaurant, but did enjoy a drink in the bar one evening. They have music on Thursday and Saturday but we arrived after it had finished. I'd stay here again and recommend it to my family and friends."
Dec 2015,50,"Lovely hotel, great location.","I've just checked out after a wonderful 3 night stay in Santa Justa.I arrived in the evening but had no problems checking in. There were two very friendly and very helpful receptionists on hand.My room, 306, was more than adequate in size, in fact I'd say it was quite large by European standards. The decor was very modern, clean well fitted out.The rain shower was lovely.The Port and Pastel de Nates was a lovely touch on arrival.Things I especially liked about the room:Nespresso machine with the pods replaced daily.The shower.The TV that had quality channelsThe UK plug sockets!The hotel is in an excellent location, very close to Rossio with trams, buses and subway to most places.I liked this hotel very much and would not hesitate to recommend it."
Dec 2015,50,Perfect break!,"Perfect location for a perfect stay when discovering Lisbon within a walking distance of some of the major touristic places.Beautiful and quite large room, elegant, well equiped, big TV (didn't watch much anyway), very confy bed, excellent shower and reliable wifi.Full buffet breakfast with local and international choices, good quality and very good coffee.We love to try local restaurants so did not use the hotels one but had a room service the first night as we arrived late. Correct service, timing, presentation and taste/portion. I cannot say more because it was late and we were tired after 4h drive so just wanted to have something light and rest.Staff was professional and very helpful all the time and good advisors for finding the most local places out of the tourist areas.I love this kind of modern and elegant ""boutique"" hotels and this one is absolutelly reccommendable and I will repeat for sure. There is still a lot of Lisbon to explore!"
Dec 2015,50,Excellent Hotel!,"We spent some days at this property last month and can only say: WOW!The Location, Service, Rooms...everything was perfect.We also went to the hotels restaurant to enjoy a Bacalau. It was delicious and the service great.We can really recommend people to stay at Hotel Santa Justa."
Dec 2015,50,Great Weekend!!!,"Everything was perfect!!The location is great, personnel more than excellent.Each detail is previously thinking for your comfort.Very comfortable rooms, you can find everything that you need.Completely advisable!!!!"
Nov 2015,50,Excellent Location & Serivce,"This hotel is at the center of center. Perfect location as many attractions are within few minutes walking distance. One draw back is that after early morning, cars are not allowed on the street. But, cross roads are within couple of minutes.Very friendly and efficient staff. Breakfast spread is huge and tasty. If we go back to Lisbon, this is the place we will stay at."
Nov 2015,50,Great location and very warm staff,"This hotel has a very warm staff, special mention about Claudia and Joao, who really made us feel welcome!  (On our first day, Claudia was all alone and managed our check-in ,our bags, people at their business center, and others inquiring at the front desk - we call her Super Claudia!) The hotel is nicely situated and less than a 5 minute walk to the old Santa Justa elevator.  The street the hotel is on becomes a pedestrian only area from 10AM to 8PM, so we timed our arrival and departures accordingly as we this was the tail end of trip and we had accumulated a lot of luggage for the 4 of us staying here. It's a nice area to shop in also.  When we arrived in our room, after a tiring day of siteseeing, there was a nice bottle of port, some egg custard, and a refrigerator full of free beverages, to welcome us to the hotel and to Lisbon.  It was nice to have this thrown in to the package. Our room was modern and spacious enough. I would definitely come back here."
Nov 2015,50,great visit,"This was our second visit to Lisbon and we picked this hotel as it is boutique and in a great location.All the staff were first class, good check in, great information about the City and nothing was too much trouble.We had a superior room with a large bathroom and great shower, slightly awkward door arrangement between the bedroom and the bathroom but not really an issue. Free mini bar with water soft drinks and beer.We ate in the hotel twice and both times it was good, breakfast was adequate.Looking for another restaurant we were recommended the Sacramento which was excellent.A hotel has only been open 2 years and is a modern refurbishment within  an old building. The refurbishment has been done with taste and has made the most of quite a small space.A great choice for a visit to Lisbon. Make sure you visit the ""time out"" market for lunch, its fantastic!"
Nov 2015,50,smack in the center,"Very conveniently located hotel, in center of the pedestrian street. It was a bit hard for the taxi driver to find and because of this we went around in circles a few times!The room was very comfortable,modern in decoration and very clean, though a bit small. Shower was super powerful. Loved the soap provided, which was in a golf ball shape and size! The staff were all extremely nice and helpful.We did not take the breakfast since it was a bit too expensive. There are many restaurants in the area. Location was perfect and we walked everywhere!Highly recommend!"
Nov 2015,40,Perfect location for exploring Lisbon,"We stayed for 6 nights at the Santa Justa and it was an excellent choice for being right in the center of Lisbon! Just a few blocks from the Santa Justa Elevador (basically a big beautiful wrought iron elevator you can take up for gorgeous views of the city), and also just a few blocks from Rua Augusta (main tourist pedestrian thoroughfare) and also one of the big squares (can't remember the name) where you can catch trains, trolleys, etc. The room we had was well appointed (Nespresso machine!) and the bed was comfy, but the room was a bit small. We stayed with our two young kids and while we all fit (baby in a crib and older child in bed with me and my husband), it was quite tight quarters. Not the hotel's fault, just something to be aware of if you're booking with family/kids (maybe there are some rooms that are bigger, but ours wasn't). The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly! They showed us places on the map, told us how to get transportation, and even would have booked us some day trip tours if we'd wanted (we opted to go on our own so we could be flexible with the kids). The food in the hotel is good but I'd say pretty over priced. We had dinner one night and breakfast one morning (both for convenience), but realized we could get much more reasonable meals out of the hotel. Do look beyond the restaurants right outside the hotel, though, as these are mainly tourist traps (the kind where guys stand outside with a menu trying to lure you in), and I think there are lots of other places with better quality than the ones right outside the hotel. We liked the Chiado area for some good restaurants. All in all, I'd definitely recommend this hotel as a perfect base for exploring Lisbon, especially if you're a couple or solo traveler (or if you're bringing kids look into room size/more than one room!)"
Nov 2015,50,A Great Surprise,"We stayed here for 4 nites in early November, 2016. The boutique hotel is wonderfully located for getting everywhere in town. Easy access to the Metro, trams and busses.   buy the Lisboa card and you'll save money on all museums and all transport is included.   The front desk personnel were very helpful with all manner of advice. This hotel is only 2 years oils - in a centuries old building.  The renovation is very modern, state of the art.  We purchased the breakfast each day and that is good idea.  The selection is quite varied and well presented in buffet format.  We ate some dinners here and it as as good as you can find anywhere.   Do not eat at the hundreds of street restaurants along this street and Rua Augusta (next adjacent avenue).  They are really just outdoor diners.   The food at the hotel was really exceptional.   Outdoor smoking at these establishments can be very distasteful to Americans who have gotten used to no smoking in restaurants.   it forced us too always eat indoors,.   Europe will catch up with the US after a few more decades. There are two drawbacks- the ambient light level at night - even with all lights on - is insufficient to do any reading at all in the room.   The other drawback is the jetted tub/shower combination.   The width of the wall into which the tub is set is so wide, that my wife had troubling stepping over the wall to get into the tub and I am 6' tall and had trouble ,but could negotiate it with great care in order to not slip.With all that said, I would definitely book this hotel again.   We were in room 502.   They are all pretty much the same."
Nov 2015,30,Mutual family ,I booked the hotel based on its high review. I have the opportunity to see the old neighborhood Santa justa through the window. The location was great. The staff are so friendly and helpful. 2 things I did not like. The room does not have sound proof and the water of the bath was leaking to the room Which make the floor wet and dirt our socks. We didn't discover the leaking until Last night of stay the water flew from the shower window. The hotel offered another room but it is too late as we should leave to airport that night.
Nov 2015,50,"Excellent location, very helpful staff","We stayed three nights at this hotel on our first visit to Lisbon. The location is great, you can walk to very many attractions and if it's too far, there is a Metro station and a taxi stand a minute away. The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean. The staff is very friendly and helpful with reservations and suggestions."
Nov 2015,50,Right in the center of the action,"The hotel is located right off a main square and on the streets that features outdoor restaurants.  It can be a bit noisy if you want to go to sleep early and leave the window open but otherwise the room was excellent and the staff is wonderful and extremely patient and helpful.  For that reason alone, I would highly recommend this hotel. The breakfast is okay and expensive and uninspired. I would recommend going to the many nearby cafes on the square instead.  You will love the bathroom with its weird electric blinds and great shower."
Nov 2015,50,Comfortable hotel in a great location,"We stayed here for the second time and it was as good as last time apart from one girl on reception, who was not as friendly and helpful as all the other staff, who were all excellent.Our bedroom was beautiful and breakfast was delicious. The best bit about this hotel is the location, within walking distance of all the trams and sights. Last time, May 2014, all the reception staff were exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable. This time all of them were the same apart from one blonde girl, who was strangely unhelpful. Still, it is only one member of staff in an otherwise excellent hotel and I would definitely stay here again when in Lisbon."
Nov 2015,50,"Excellent hotel, good value","This is a boutique hotel in the center of Lisbon's historic downtown. The property is very well maintained, the staff could not be more accommodating and the rooms are very spacious. I highly recommend this property."
Nov 2015,40,"Excellent hotel, central location","Great for being central and able to get to most tourist attractions on foot. The staff are extremely helpful . We had a superior corner room with balconies on both sides. Great views and even though there was building work going on nearby, the quality of the windows meant the noise was not intrusive. We got ""pestered"" by the restaurants outside the hotel but within a couple of days we had switched off to them. Would definitely go back and next time would like to try the food."
Oct 2015,40,Fine Hotel Great Location,"My wife and I stayed there for three nights in October 2015. Modern clean hotel in an old building in the historic district. Staff was very helpful. One block to tram lines, Metro and yellow bus tours. Close to Rossi station. Only complaint was that the room was a little small. This is typical of Europe and especially of a historic building. We did not get breakfast included and it cost €15 each. We decided to get coffee and pastries at the Suica Pastelerie which is one block away. They also have American breakfast. Eat inside at the counter which is much less expensive than waiter service outside."
Oct 2015,40,Great location in the centre of Lisbon,"We stayed here at the end of October, and were very impressed by how central the hotel was. It's walking distance to anything you'd want to see in Lisbon, and very close to tram and metro stops. It's worth getting the suite for a little extra room if you're staying for a few days. The room was very comfortable, and quiet despite being close to the elevator. The service from the staff was excellent - they were very helpful."
Oct 2015,50,Amazing hotel,"First I must say- my review is a bit biased because on check-in we told that we've been upgraded to suite =)We order the hotel with some Tripadvisor last-minute campaign so we god a very luxury hotel with affordable price.The rooms are amazing! very big, super sleep quality, great balcony to the street, and fully equipment shower with jacuzzi.The hotel located right in the center and you have everything you need right next to the hotel.Plus- the mini bar is free!"
Oct 2015,50,A real find!,"A really good place to stay. Very useful for all attractions and within easy walking distance of Tram connections (to Belim and the Castle) and the river tour.Very spacious room (Santa Justa Suite) was excellant, the use of free WiFi and a free mini bar (daily replenished fruit Juice,Water,Coke etc), was a nice touch. Breakfasts are on a grand scale and plenty of choice.Will go back again next time we are in Lisbon."
Oct 2015,40,very good hotel,"excellent location. within a walking distance to every attraction and to the interesting neighborhoods. very friendly staff. eager to help in every possible way. roomy rooms. good breakfast, even better than most street restaurants. very good value for money"
Oct 2015,50,Birthday weekend at Santa Justa Horel,"My birthday present, was a weekend in Lisbon from the Algarve.Santa Justa was chosen for its location and reviews on trip advisor.As the hotel knew it was my birthday, they up graded our room, and put birthday cake and a bottle of port in our room.A lovely big, bright room with a great bathroom with lovely freebies and a free basic mimi bar.The location was perfect, we walked everywhere.The staff were friendly, efficient and extremely helpful.The breakfast was amazing - something for every taste.I would highly recommend Santa Justa."
Oct 2015,50,Outstanding staff brilliant service great rooms terrific location,"We chose this hotel because we wanted a central position in the old town and the reviews on Tripadvisor were so good.Location - It is positioned on a side street just off the Placa do Figuera, near the Placa do Rossio, and one block east of the Main Street running down to the Triumphal Arch, the Placa do Comercio and the river front. Lots of restaurants touting for your trade in the same street and in the nearby cross streets and Main Street as above. Metro station, bus and tram stops and the Hop-on Hop-off buses all are nearby. Hotel - it is modern smart with all the facilities you want. Large bathroom with bath and huge rain shower over the bath. Comfortable beds, large TV with over 60 channels, free mini-bar, welcome bottle of port and two Pasteis when you book in. Free coffee and cakes in the bar everyday from 4-6 pm. Free WiFi. Our room had a Nespresso coffee machine and a daily two free coffee capsules. Only criticism, the room was a bit dark and didn't really have enough lighting. Staff -All were absolutely brilliant. Extremely friendly and helpful, they did absolutely everything to ensure our stay was problem free and our visit was a success.  Breakfast was great - a large choice of breads rolls fruit cheese smoked salmon and cakes, orange juice and fruits.  All for 15 Euros. Definitely first choice on any return to Lisbon."
Oct 2015,40,Excellent hotel; super location,"We had a super short break in Lisbon at the Santa Justa Hotel.  The hotel is in a great location just off Rossio and Figuera Square in the Baixa at the centre of the old city and very close to lots of the places to see, restaurants, tram and bus tours, and transport links.  The Santa Justa is a modern, well-presented hotel.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  Free wi-fi is included and a free mini-bar with soft drinks, water, and a beer.  Breakfast was adequate although not great value, and the restaurant area got very crowded for breakfast from 09:30 – eat early!  The rooms are air-conditioned and attractive, and the bed was very comfortable.  There was an excellent bathroom with a huge walk-in shower.  On the down side, the room lighting was very dim and flexibility to turn up the lights would have been welcome.  Hanging and drawer space in the one closet alcove was not really sufficient.  The closet alcove also contains the mini-bar and in-room safe.  A strange room design means that a single sliding door serves for both the bathroom and closet space --   you can use the door for one or the other but don’t try to use the drawers when the bathroom door is being slid open!  Nevertheless, a super stay."
Oct 2015,40,nice place,"we enjoyed our stay for the week. the staff was very pleasant, the room clean and even though we were next to the elevators, we didn't hear them. Taxis will drop you off a block from the hotel as they can't get down the street most of the time. Restaurant was very good and the staff there were super. The breakfast buffet was over priced."
Oct 2015,40,central location with well equipped rooms,"This hotel is minutes from Rossio where there is a variety of public transport, shops and restaurants. The hotel is modern within a traditional building. Our room was a good size with a rain forest shower in the ensuite, a free minivan with soft drinks and comfortable beds.We did have to request that our toiletries and drinks were replenished each day and even though we left the notice on our door the room was not serviced."
Oct 2015,40,good location,"Great location in the centre. Friendly staff. Breakfast was a crush but food was fine.  Room was nice, good view, a little on the small side. No bath. Some nice touches, like the little bottle of port on arrival but some niggles too.  Everything worked well.We thought it was way over priced for what is a pleasant but quite simple hotel.  Good but I think you could do better."
Oct 2015,50,Excellent choice for a weekend city break.,"We stayed for four nights and we do not travel light. We had requested a high floor, away from the lift. We got exactly that. The room was a little smaller than some hotel rooms. Looking on the floor plan for the fire escape, our room was one of the smaller ones. This was fine, as it was well appointed and well designed. Should you need more space ( we may have struggled with more than one large suitcase and two carry on bags) ask for a bigger room. The bed was large and comfortable and everywhere was super clean.The breakfast was excellent as was the soundproofing in the room. We also liked the free minibar in the room. Why do other hotels not do this? This was our second trip to Lisbon and we felt that this hotel was the better situated of the two hotels we have stayed in in central Lisbon. We would certainly stay again and we would look out for this  hotel chain in other cities."
Oct 2015,50,Lovely Hotel,"Lovely hotel, very central. Was quite modern, clean and had the comfiest bed I've ever slept in, wanted to take it home!  Breakfast was great with everything you could think of and the staff couldn't do enough for you. Port and custard tarts when we arrived a lovely gesture as was the complimentary mini bar with water and juices.Only thing missing were tea and coffee making facilities (there was an espresso machine) but a lot of European hotels don't have that.We are in the hotel one night which was OK but lots of better restaurants  round about.Would highly recommend and would definitely stay there again."
Oct 2015,50,Get WhatYouPay For,"Once again used TripAdvisor to choose our Hotel ,sort list off 5 .Santa Justa Highest rated in 4 star and good reviews.First off Hotel easy to get too,underground from airport ,then 5 min walk .location very central three of the main squares close by .If its shopping your after one street away from main shopping ave also To many Restaurants to choose from.Now to the hotel itself ,Reception staff very friendly and helpful, rooms clean .small  bottle of Port and two custard tarts waiting for you.Mini bar is free! don't get to excited only 1 beer and the rest water, soft drink ect. Smart TV on the wall with free internet .Bathroom quite large with walk in  rain shower, towels changed every day no matter what time you get up. Bar area a bit on the small side probably due to hotel Restaurant being popular (getting as many tables in as they can).To sum up would i stay her again and recommend it to friends a big YES from me"
Oct 2015,50,Ideal location,"The staff at Reception greeted us warmly, stored our luggage away until our room was ready ( we had arrived on an early flight) and gave us a tourist map with helpful advice on popular tourist attractions and how to get there. We had an attic room with a liitle window looking over Lisbon across to the Santa Justa elevador.  On arrival there was a little welcome note with chocolate on the bed and, later that evening, a bottle of port, glasses and pastries were left for us. The room itself was spacious, clean and modern, well laid out and the bed was comfortable.The buffet breakfast had plenty of variety with some hot food, cereals, juice, fruit, yoghurts, cold meats and cheeses, bread and a toaster, bread rolls, jams and pastries. Surely something for everyone there!The hotel itself was centrally located, easy walking distance to city centre attractions, shops and restaurants. The public transport system was easy to use and great for exploring Lisbon.Try a Segway trip with Awesome Segway tours. Its good fun and helps you find your way around. Lisbon is a lovely city we would revisit and stay in Hotel Santa Justa again. Would definitely recommend it to others."
Oct 2015,50,Lisbon,"We went to Lisbon on city trip. We were looking for a hotel in the anciënt  city.Hotel Santa Justa was very Well situated. We were warmly welcomed and received usefull information for our trip. The room was modern, light and clean. The staff had foreseen us with a welcome gift, a little bottle Port wine and Some local pastery. Breakfast was abondantly and for dinner we had the choice beween snacks, salades and complete meals at a  reasonable  price. The service was always very polite.We were very pleased with our stay at this hotel."
Oct 2015,50,Chic Hotel in the heart of the city,"Very happy with our choice to stay at Hotel Santa Justa. Room: The room was clean, comfortable, quiet, spacious and very modern and new looking. The only thing that could have been better would be a softer mattress and more luxurious bedding, but we are very picky and most would find it very good I'm sure. Robes and slippers provided and nespresso machines in the room. Service: staff was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was excellent quality with lots of choicesLocation: Great location to be able to easily walk around the historic districts of the city, Alfama and Chiado. Also it was right near the subway and a 10 min walk to the train."
Sep 2015,40,Great location!,"Stayed at this hotel a while ago. We were on the top most floor as we need a bit more room for an extra bed. Being at the top meant a part of the celling was a low sloping roof and it took a few head bumps before we were fully aware of this!We received a nice welcome with a small bottle of wine and pastel de nattas, a traditional Portuguese delicacy!The location of the hotel is great as everything is within walking distance and literally all around you.Sadly there were a few negatives too, the first 2 little capsules for the coffee machine were complimentary, thereafter each one cost 2 Euros!!  A bit steep for coffee!! The coffee machine had not been cleaned after the previous use and had stale smelling water in and the teaspoons still had coffee stains on them.Our last night there we had dinner in the restaurant on the ground floor. Obviously there was a translation issue as my husband kept saying ""medium"" but his steak came  out still saying ""moo"" each time. After this happened 3 times, my husband was exasperated, me  and my son had to watch our food getting cold in front of us, the Chef came out because he could understand why his creation kept getting sent back!! Finally then everyone was on the same page, and the steak came out cooked as desired, but by then we were all quite fed up and hungry and it put a damper on the last night of a beautiful 14 day vacation :("
Sep 2015,50,"The only good restaurant on this street,",We had a very nice dinner at this hotel. Food and service was great.The live music was also good.I can really recommend it. / Johannes(The rest of the restaurants on this street was real tourist traps.)
Sep 2015,40,Street restaurant a touch of class - amongst riffraff,"White table cloths, refined black accents, fine dishes and wine, professional intelligent waiters.  Their burgers were very good.  great location - just walk a little farther and enjoy a peaceful lunch on the street just steps past the tourist restaurants."
Sep 2015,40,Superb location for a City break,"A very comfortable, clean, friendly and reasonably quiet hotel, based in the centre of Lisbon and within walking distance to the many attractions. We loved Lisbon and for anybody who has never visited this city before is a ""must"" place to go. We cannot comment on the food, as we opted to have breakfast in one the many cafes in the main squares and back streets. This was a return visit to the Santa Justa and I suspect it wont be the last."
Sep 2015,40,Very nice hotel,"Everything was perfect except the sound isolation in rooms, quite a bit of noise.Rooms were clean, comfortable and good service. Breakfast selection could be better though. Was live music in the evening in the lounge which was fantastic."
Sep 2015,50,"Wonderful Room, Staff and Location","Went for my anniversary and found that the hotel was fabulously placed for getting around, being really central and close to the train stations and the metro. It's about 50 metres from the Santa Justa Elevator, which has fabulous views. The staff were fantastic and made sure we had some fantastic Portuguese sparkling wine on arrival (Messias which was superb) and booked restaurants and advised on all the things we wanted to do over the trip. To top it all, when we were leaving, our Lisbon cards had expired, so they gave us their own via viagem cards to get back to the airport! It was very straightforward to get to the hotel using the metro (Airport->Avendida->Rossio) so unless you have lots of luggage, save yourself time and money and take the metro."
Sep 2015,50,Very nice hotel!,"Perfect!We stayed at Santa Justa for 3 night while in Lisbon to get married! We had a suite and it was really nice and spacious. The bathroom was lovely. We told the staff of the purpose of our visit and was both treated with a little bottle of port and a sweet cake at arrival, and a small bottle of sparkling wine and fresh fruit with both chocolate and red berry sauce. Breakfast was also good."
Sep 2015,50,Hotel in Lisbon excellent location,"Excellent service, location very nice rooms walking distance . One block away from shopping area, restaurantsPastry shops everywhere. One of the most beautiful country. Taxis or transportation one block away. Tui tu are a good transportation to see the city."
Sep 2015,30,wonderful hotel in a great location,"Staff were very friendly.   Room was lovely (attic room). Could walk anywhere. Would have preferred a better hotel bar.   While you could get a drink,  there wasn't a place to sit at the bar and service was not quick.   That said,  overall it was a great experience and the staff were terrific."
Sep 2015,50,Excellent stay,"The staff were most hospitable and our preference in room (for 3 adults) was taken into consideration. Lovely decor and a spacious bedroom. The location is excellent too, close to shops and several restaurants/ cafes. Would visit again!"
Sep 2015,40,"Beautiful Hotel, Centrally Located!","A beautiful, modern hotel right in the heart of Lisbon.  Lovely, quiet rooms with everything you need.  The staff are very friendly and helpful too.  The restaurant serves a huge breakfast, the food was fine, however, you can go to the corner and get something smaller, better and cheaper.  They have outdoor seating for the restaurant where you can sit and relax and enjoy their great wine list after a day of sight seeing.  I recommend this hotel for your stay in Lisbon!"
Sep 2015,40,Excellent,"Very nice boutique hotel. Staff is very nice and helpful. Room is clean and very beautiful - shower is amazing! Great location, but be aware cars can't access hotel street, you have to walk about one block. Great cost benefit."
Sep 2015,50,Lovely Lisbon Hotel,We chose this hotel for its location and we were not disappointed as it is situated on a pedestrianised street just a short stroll from restaurants and shops. We asked the hotel to arrange a pick up at the airport and Pedro was waiing for us on arrival - we coudn't have asked for a more friendly welcome. We booked a suite and were pleasantly surprised by the spaciousness. We woud recommend the hotel restaurant which does not have a huge menu but the food we ate was tasty and nicely presented. All the hotel staff were friendly and personable - wouldnt hesitate to make another booking.
Sep 2015,50,Great place to stay,"The Hotel Santa Justa has an Excellent  service. At the front desk they are always trying to help you with directions and giving advice on the best places  to visit. Very good location, close to many tourist attractions within walking distance. Nice and clean rooms and very comfortable with good tea and coffee. The shower was very good and a lot of food quality amenities. Would come back again. The restaurant  is very small but the food was very good and the menu had a lot of choices. At night the restaurant has live music. Very quiet hotel . We didnt hear any noises at night."
Sep 2015,50,Great Location and Boutique Hotel,"The Santa Justa is a beautiffuly designed smaller Boutique Hotel right in the city centre near the Rua Augusta. Great room design, Santa Justa Suite, with big marble bathroom, two balconies. Breakfast good selection, nice outside dining area in the walking street, right amongst many other restaurants.Staff were great.Very well priced hotel."
Sep 2015,50,Great Lisbon Hotel,"You could not find a better location - in the centre of the best shopping area with some excellent restaurants nearby. Also a 15 minute stroll to the Cais do Sodre - the central point for the Metro , local trains , regional trains , and ferries. The Hotel is modern with a 4 star rating - we stayed in a suite with a mini balcony on the 4th floor - spacious with double glazed windows that shut out any noise but still allow you , during the day , to open the doors and allow the fresh air to blow through the suite.The front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel restaurant serves quality food at reasonable prices and is one of the better restaurants we ate at in Lisbon. The free wi-fi connection was reasonably quick and you can log on with as many devices you wish. Not a cheap hotel but worth the money.Would happily return."
Sep 2015,50,Great choice in a perfect location,"Modern hotel with a young, helpful team at the concierge desk. It was very reasonably priced in a great location. The hotel has its own restaurant that seemed very popular. We didn't eat there as we chose to visit other neighborhoods for our dinners."
Sep 2015,50,Perfect Location in Lisbon,"This is a great modern little hotel on a side street very close to the water, the Santa Justa elevator, Barrio Alto, subway stops, and some of the main city squares. The staff was very helpful and the hotel is clean and inviting."
Sep 2015,30,Just a couple of tweaks from excellent!,"Location was superb, in the heart of the city center, easy to walk everywhere.Stayed in an attic room on the 6th floor. Great view, but very small windows. New modern finishes that look great, but not always practical. For example, lighting was poor, worst we experienced in any hotel room. A/C controls were not user friendly. Could not figure it out during out 3 day stay. Bathroom shared a sliding panel door with the closet. This requires coordination if one person is coming out of the bathroom while the other is getting things out of the closet. Otherwise, bathroom was best part of the room. Expected better quality pillows for the price. Perfect example of an interior designer given full reign without input from the operational side. Wake-up service was poor. Got it right only one out of three requests.Likely to recommend provided that management corrects the deficiencies noted."
Sep 2015,50,A lovely and comfortable hotel,"Hotel Santa Justa is a great hotel in the heart of historic Lisbon.  Staff at every level were efficient and kind, making us feel very comfortable.  Modern rooms and facilities within a historic context made this the perfect choice for us,  I can't imagine we would choose anywhere else upon our return to this terrific city."
Sep 2015,50,Great place to stay in Lisbon,"Hotel Santa Justa is fantastic!  The staff are lovely - they are friendly and very keen to help with whatever query you may have.  The rooms are great - spacious, clean and funky. The bathroom in particular has everything you need. I was in room 401 which had a balcony.  It was nice to be able to step outside and watch what was going on in the street below.  The location of the hotel is perfect - near the water and other local attractions.  If I ever returned to Lisbon I would definitely stay in Hotel Santa Justa again."
Sep 2015,50,Excellent hotel in central location,"The hotel is very well situated between central Lisbon's two main squares.  The rooms were spotless and a good size.  Sound insulation was excellent. Travelling with two daughters we opted for the family room (2 rooms each with a lockable door next to each other, the whole suite having a further door.  This combination works very well.  Breakfast was excellent (lovely fresh orange juice, good coffee, fresh fruit, ham, cheese, cakes etc).  Front of house staff could not have been more helpful.  Strongly recommended."
Sep 2015,50,Super little hotel in fantastic location and very comfy beds !,"We had a great stay at this hotel, in a superb location right in the heart of the prettiest part of Lisbon. We had a family room which was 2 nice sized rooms together with a separate front door. beds were very comfortable, staff helpful and breakfast plentiful. I missed the email reminding me to book parking so that was a bit of a bind. In the end we parked in the square only 5 mins away and paid Eur 35 for around 28 hours parking, not cheap but the hotel offer was Eur 29 for the night so typically was expensive but it is city centre.Would definitely recommend Santa Justa for anyone doing a short stay in the city."
Aug 2015,40,Restaurant was a relief,After been hogged by all the enjoying propers(the guys that try to weal you in to there restaurant) we just wanted a quiet dinner with nice service. And what a delight it was having Jacir serving us. We was a great server! The octopus was amazing! And the tuna steak was also super! We were with a table of six and we had a great dinner with amazing service. I know that couveurts is something normal in Lisbon but from a 4 star hotel u would think they would ask. Instead of just serving and expecting us to pay. They could have asked if we wanted it. But that was not a problem in the end because Jacir was amazing! He gave us the best service we had all week!
Aug 2015,50,Perfect Location and amazing Staff!,"Our room was quiet (409) corner room with a view of the city, no noise above or in the hallway because they have carpet in the hallway.  The front desk staff is the best.  They recommended Sacramento and Mercantina restaurants while we were there and they were both amazing."
Aug 2015,50,Great place and great staff,Stayed for 2 nights in one of the suites - family of four. Hotel is very central and easy to get to and close to all the main sights.  Breakfast was great with a really good choice available.  Staff were superb in particular Joao who couldn't do enough to help.
Aug 2015,40,"Great location, great staff, great rooms","A very nice two night stay here at Santa Justa. Not the easiest place to find since it didn't exist on our sat nav (the hotel is two years old and I obviously need an update) but a quick call to the hotel and the friendly staff were able to direct us. The confusion lay with the car parking as we had contacted the hotel ahead of our visit to reserve a space in the underground car park (€29 a day...gulp!!) Even from all the correspondence I had no idea that the car park is actually the public underground car park which is located in the Figuiera square a few mins walk away! I thought the hotel had a small private parking area at the hotel but they don't. You park in the car park, wherever you like and then hand your ticket into reception. They will then give you a card which allows you to go in and out of the car park throughout your stay whenever you like at a discounted price of €29 a day. Not cheap but it is a city. Anyway, the hotel itself is great. We stayed as a family of four in a suite (the kids had the sofa bed) and there was plenty of space although no parent privacy here, just a thin see though curtain separating the two sleeping areas. Great bathroom with jacuzzi bath and swanky rain shower. Smart TV, Nespresso machine, free minibar and we were even welcomed with a small bottle of port and custard tarts in the room. Nice touches. Breakfast was ok, nothing special and personally, for a four star hotel it shouldn't all be completely self service. They should at least show you to your table and serve you tea and coffee but they don't.We ate one night there but enjoyed drinks and nibbles al fresco both nights and was particularly impressed with Tania who was delightful, very friendly and enjoyed recommending various wines etc. Wines and food were good. We also enjoyed people watching 'run the gauntlet' of men trying to entice you into their restaurant down the entire street. We watched for hours. Very entertaining!! My only real complaint was that we didn't sleep particularly well. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was because so many here on Trip Advisor had said how quiet it was in the rooms despite being on a busy street. On the whole, yes, the soundproofing is excellent for general noise but it doesn't drown out the bin men at 3am who were incredibly loud! I will bring earplugs next time. I guess it might be one of the reasons why the air conditioning, although very efficient is also the loudest I have experienced even on the lowest setting.On the whole though, we would definitely return. A great choice in a great location for exploring the city."
Aug 2015,40,Nice small hotel in Lisbon city centre,Very small and thus not crowded hotel in the city centre.near of public transport and taxi's around the corner.Extremely friendly and attentive staff.Surrounded of 'tourist trap restaurants' but also near of better restaurants.Breakfast is a great mix between continental and Portuguese sweets. Just fabulous.
Aug 2015,50,Holiday in Europe,"Booking a hotel based only online when traveling to Europe can be daunting but Hotel Santa Justa is all it says it is and more. The location could not be more perfect, walking distance to everything a first timer in Portugal needs to see. I started emailing with the hotel weeks before we arrived to set up tours, ask questions and make dinner reservations. They could not have been more accommodating. The hotel has beautiful rooms and also includes American outlets. The breakfast downstairs is a good option if in a rush or don’t feel like walking to find a place. We had a great room facing the street that was not noisy at all. The bathroom was great and the air conditioning was very comfortable-which is sometimes needed in the summer in Europe! There is limited closet and drawer space which seems to be a trend in Europe, but was not a huge issue for us. With an amazing location and lovely staff, hotel Santa Justa lived up to everything and more."
Aug 2015,50,Excellent hotel in city centre location,"We chose this hotel for its city location and we weren't disappointed. The staff were welcoming and very friendly and very helpful giving us advice about the various areas of the city, trams etc. The reception was very clean and check-in was quick and efficient. We had booked a Superior Comfort room for 3 adults. The room was a very good size and the extra bed for the 3rd adult was a full sized bed not a sofa bed. The room was very clean and laid out with robes, slippers, a well-stocked mini-bar which was refilled every day free of charge. The welcome gift of pastries and a small bottle of port was an unexpected extra. There was plenty of cupboard and drawer space and a good safe. The bathroom was spacious with full-sized jacuzzi bath - and a rain shower! Breakfast was excellent and was served in the hotel restaurant. A huge choice was laid out ranging from cereals, fresh juice, bacon, eggs, sausages, fresh fruit, meats & cheeses, rolls, toast, pastries...and tea & coffee. Couldn't have been better.Our only 'negative' comment is that the bath/shower controls were at the farthest end of the bath inside a screened bath so were difficult to reach.  Lisbon has so much to see and do. We would recommend the Yellowbus 48 hour tickets for tours 1 & 2. Both tours last about one and a half hours and show you so much of the city. The same tickets can be used for the whole 48 hours on buses/trams, so no need to do the tram tour. The Aerobus ticket gave us 10% off the tour tickets. Great value.Our whole experience was excellent. Lisbon is a lovely city, one we will return to and we would definitely stay at the Santa Justa again.Easy transfer from the airport (Aerobus 1 to Rossio Square). Easy walking from all the main areas of city. Great location.Really central position 10 minutes walk from River, Commercial Square. Santa Justa lift, Castle, trams all in easy reach."
Aug 2015,40,Great hotel/service in a busy part of Lisbon - not the best parking!,"This hotel was great for a number of reasons - first and foremost, it's got great rooms at a reasonable price (a little on the higher end if you're on a budget, but you certainly get what you pay for). No complaints about the staff or service we received.If you're looking to stay in the middle of the downtown or Baixa region of Lisbon, this hotel is a good choice...we realized a bit too late that this meant staying in the midst of the most tourist-y area of the city. The hotel lies at the end of a street filled with restaurants, all of which try to coax you into their establishments at any hour of the day. It's always busy, and many (if not all) of the restaurants nearby cater to tourists. None of this is a bad thing -- the hotel is incredibly well located to see many of the sights in Lisbon, and many people might in fact enjoy being surrounded by tourist destinations. In retrospect, we probably would have preferred a different neighborhood, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the hotel itself.One small note about the parking - the hotel does provide parking, but it's in the adjacent square (they just have a few spots reserved there in the underground garage). The square is just a block away from the hotel...but since you can't drive onto the street in front of the hotel, it is a bit of a trek with bigger suitcases, etc."
Aug 2015,50,"Perfect location, Modern and Spotless",Location is excellent for walking to main attractions in downtown Lisbon. Close to hop on/hop off bus stop. Very clean and modern. Front desk staff was helpful and kind.Was very quiet over night. No street noise to complain of. Plenty of restaurants just outside the door and in the streets surrounding the area. Breakfast was good too. Would definitely recommend
Aug 2015,50,Great hotel downtown Lisbon,"We stayed here for one night but wish we had stayed longer. Loved the location downtown. Walking distance to castle, Alfama, Bairro Alto and lot more. Staff was friendly and helpful. Definitely worth the money"
Aug 2015,40,Trip to Portugal,The location of the hotel was excellent. Staff was very friendly and very helpful. Rooms were clean and not too small or big but just sufficiently large. Breakfast was kind of expensive so we ate out in all the surrounding cafes.
Aug 2015,50,"Ideally located, high standard","The reception was very helpfull and attentive (a great relief compared to Rome).Room is up to standard; allthough the hotel is on a quite busy street, it was quit in the room.Breakfast is varied and tasteful."
Jul 2015,50,Visit,"Great all around!  Staff was great, food very good, rooms very clean, love the location.   Room was very spacious and clean.  Tub a bit too high however, despite loving the shower.  Highly recommended for any trip"
Jul 2015,50,Great central location but still quiet,"Easy to get to on the metro from the airport and in the centre of Lisbon. It is on a busy pedestrian only road and we were concerned our first floor room overlooking the road with its restaurants would be noisy but not so. The room was very clean, comfortable and stylish. The reception staff spoke good English and were very helpful.  We did not take the €15 breakfast option and given fresh juice, sandwich and coffee from one of the bakery /cafes is only €3 we did not regret it.Overall couldn't have asked for more."
Jul 2015,50,Perfect location,"We stayed for 3 nights in late June and were very happy with our choice. First I have to say the front desk staff were so helpful and pleasant, they couldn't do enough for us! All of their suggestions were wonderful, especially the little restaurant with the Fado singers, sorry can't remember the name. The rooms were modern and very clean. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Lastly, the location cannot be beat, close to everything."
Jul 2015,50,Chic hotel with perfect Lisbon location,"One of the best European hotels ever: friendly concierges willing to arrange tours and restaurants; lovely rooms; perfect plumbing (instant hot water) in marble bathrooms; thick white towels; fantastically comfortable beds, good AC; excellent restaurant with outstanding service as part of the hotel; themed decor;  free wifi; plus perfect location in central Lisbon to walk to harbor, shops, and restaurants.  No street noise in the rooms my friends and I had.  I highly recommend this great hotel."
Jul 2015,50,Excellent for our family of 4,"Loved this hotel.   We had the family suite which was two rooms interconnected by a small private hallway.   Beds were basically two twins together. Highights: beds & linens very good, coffee in room, welcome pastry and port a nice touch, room was modern and roomy with multiple plugs for charging devices, excellent breakfast (eggs were delicious as were pastries and cheeses), great wifi, central location to everything, front desk people very helpful."
Jul 2015,50,Central location walking distance to everywhere. Wonderful staff. Modern simple room which was quiet,booked the Suite which was street side by still very quiet. No street noise or noise room other rooms. Star was extremely accommodating and helpful. Can walk to all the surrounding districts. The room mini bar was complimentary including water juice and beer. Nice small restaurant on site with good food and wine.  Arraigned a ride from the airport through the hotel which was very convenient ( 25 euros). We had the daily breakfast which had good food options. Would definitely stay here again.
Jul 2015,40,Very good choice,"We spent four nights with 2 small kids in the hotel. Not ideal with kids (no swimming pool, noisy and busy neighbourhood, the hotel is in the middle of a pedestrian zone), but still a good experience. The staff is very kind and is trying to help always. The rooms are good, there is nothing missing. And the windows are sensational. Despite facing a noisy pedestrian zone full of restaurants, once you close the window you don´t hear anything.I would go there again. Not with kids, but for sure without them."
Jul 2015,50,"Amazing atmosphere, location and hospitality","Excellent hotel, located in the heart of Lisbon. Close to the sea and the shopping area. Amazing amenities, hospitality and atmosphere. I totally recommend this hotel as you will feel like home, food is amazing, the locations, rooms are decorated nicely and very clean and spacious. You will repeat!"
Jul 2015,50,A Great Find,I always worry when selecting a hotel. I'm happy I selected the Santa Justa. The location is smacking the middle of where you need to be. The rooms are comfortable and modern. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I would definitely reccomend it!
Jul 2015,40,Well located hotel in Lisbon,"We stayed at Santa Justa, primarily for its location and we really could not have chosen better. However, there are a couple of issues which prevent us from giving it a full 5 stars. Every time we approached or left the hotel, we are approached aggressively by people to eat at one of the distinctly average restaurants located on the same road as the hotel.Having pool in the heat of Summer must be a must, although this hotel did not have one.However the staff that we dealt with were ever so charming and helpful and we could not have asked for better staff."
Jul 2015,50,Great stay in Lisbon,"My family and I stayed here for eight nights in July, 2015 and feel compelled to write a glowing review of it. The many positives include its excellent location (no better in Lisbon for a tourist); it's excellent and striving staff; it's superior cleanliness; great room design; and comfort level. The few negatives include rooms dimly lit for evening use; a little pricey rate than it should be; and a crowded front desk area. I would highly recommend staying here as my party, consisting of a 4 year old to a 70 year old, all enjoyed it completely."
Jul 2015,50,Fantastic Hotel in the heart of Lisbon,"We booked two nights at the Hotel Santa Justa based on the reviews from TripAdvisor. What a find, excellent location, fantastic customer service, really friendly staff and lovely room with a spa bath and a free mini bar. We even received a complimentary port and pastels da nata on our arrival.Breakfast was very good, we can't comment on other meals as we did not have any in their restaurant.If I had a niggle at all, it would be that the room didn't have a kettle. Although there was a Nespresso machine in the room, a kettle would have been welcome, but this is only a minor point.Would highly recommend this hotel and hope to visit again."
Jul 2015,50,Great hotel at the heart of town,"This is a great hotel option in the heart of old Lisbon near Rossi Square and the Santa Justa lift.  It's reasonably priced and quite well appointed with excellent staff.  We only booked the basic ' comfort' option and, if revisiting, would consider a superior upgrade just for a little more space but what we had was adequate.  We didn't like the first room that we were offered so contacted reception.  Within 5 minutes we were in something we liked better.  It's interesting that the staff consider the attic rooms to be a kind of 'premium comfort' room and their Portuguese guests prefer them.  This is because you can see out over rooftops.  We found it somewhat claustrophobic but the change was done with minimum fuss and good humour.The bar was very reasonable priced, cheaper in fact than the Buraco Bar around the corner, so we used it regularly.  Previous reviewers suggested that the breakfast is overpriced and we had to agree - a good bet is the Cais de Colonades which is 2 minutes down the road towards the sea and serves everything from English style to cake, fruit, etc.WiFi was good and even the choice of TV channels better than anything else we experienced in the 4 different places that we stayed.Coffee and tea facilities were a little limited but, again, better than any other of the hotels.  Port was given to us on the first night (a taster) and the minibar was free (primarily soft drinks but far more convenient than using a bar).So it's difficult to knock this place and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to friends, etc. or return myself.Only 2 gripes really - the Muzak in the reception and bar area must have been a 1 hour CD so it got monotonous (staff are driven crazy by it) and all of the restaurants within a 100m radius are rubbish and pestering so do good research on where to eat (or try the hotel restaurant, we didn't but plenty did).Definitely a place to recommend in the heart of town."
Jul 2015,50,"Clean, friendly and great location!",Great location -short walk to everything from this hotel. The beds were firm and the rooms clean and big enough from a European standard. The room was quiet and the blinds very good. There are Nespresso machines in the rooms. Bring some milk to keep in the complementary bar fridge- reloaded daily with some drinks. Enjoy the apples in the lobby!
Jul 2015,50,One night in Lisbon,We stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa Lisboa and it was EXCELLENT in every way!  The room was superb  and the bed was SO comfortable!!  The hotel was modern and had been redone about three years ago.  It was very clean.  The staff was helpful and courteous.  We ate dinner at the hotel.  The food was delicious and reasonable priced.  The location was great.  You will definitely not be disappointed with your stay at this hotel.
Jul 2015,20,Don't do it  ... eat at then restaurant that is.,"Well, looks can be deceiving. My wife and I visited the restaurant in the hotel, well actually on the street outside. The looks and local is fabulous, the staff and food, not so good.Let me say firstly that we were the first to arrive, more came as our meal was served.1) They had no idea how to make the basic cocktails - although in the end they confessed to using the Internet to make my Martini.2) The pasta my wife had was awful, just 5 prawns swiming in a sea of oil and pasta. She could not finish it.3) We were charged for Couvert we didn't order or eat and sent back.4) The waiter kept apologising however did nothing to rectify any matters.We left - and we won't be back."
Jul 2015,50,Great stay in a great hotel,"Last minute trip to Lisbon meant I picked this hotel just the day before - but I got very lucky.  Centrally located - right in the middle of shops, restaurants and a 1 minute walk from the main squares and transport links - it was a calm oasis in a busy city.Clean, well-lit, spacious room, friendly staff and a fabulous welcome gift: tawny port and some yummy pasteis de nata... I really couldn't have done better.Lisbon is an amazing city and this was a great find, that I will be returning to."
Jul 2015,50,"Great service, best location","Everything was really great, just a tip: we ordered the superior room for our parents, but it was not as good as the regular rooms and not worth the extra payment. The window was small and the room felt claustrophobic. We asked a transfer and they changed it real quick and with no questions.The staff was really nice. We were a group of 10, every morning they organized the breakfast table for us with a personal touch and care from the waitresses.The rooms were clean and well tended. Would suggest to go there!"
Jul 2015,50,One of the highlights of our trip,"Wonderful stay at the Hotel Santa Justa. Perfect location, professional and welcoming staff, comfortable and clean rooms. Everything about this hotel was perfectly executed. The breakfast was also 1st class.  Highly recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Lisbon. We'll be back for sure."
Jul 2015,40,Thank you French Air Traffic Controllers,"One night delay with son due to a strike ended up with us discovering this good city centre hotel. Couldn't really ask for more from the small but modern room with hip aspirations (check out the glass walled shower). Of course you are in the middle of a touristy area but Lisbon is such a quirky and interesting City that that does not matter. Staff were young, friendly and really helpful. If I stayed again I would probably have skipped the hotel breakfast for one in the nearby cafes or coffee shops where the locals pop into on their way to work. This place would be great for a 20 something couples weekend away."
Jul 2015,50,"Great Location, Amenities and Service","This hotel is located in the central district of Lisbon, on a pedestrian street.  You don't need a car in Lisbon.  All rooms are very modern (universal outlets, marble in the bathrooms, best shower ever, etc.) and face the street.  Don't worry -- it quiets down by 9 or 10 as the restaurants close down then.  Service is friendly but not intrusive.  As an example, the front desk clerk helped me track down a restaurant serving octopus, since that's what I was in the mood for.  They'll help you find a tour, or a pastry, or a New York Times.  They're right around the corner from the Santa Justa lift, and in the heart of all activities."
Jul 2015,50,Leisure Trip in Lisbon,"Visited Lisbon with a friend for 3 days. Beautiful hotel. Easy to get to from airport. Marianna checked us in very quickly and even gave us a room upgrade. Largest room I have ever stayed in in Europe. Beautiful decor and ammenities. By far the nicest bathroom I have seen. Extremely clean, comfortable, and quiet. Would highly recommend to other travellers."
Jul 2015,50,Great location great service ! ,We stayed at Santa justa a hotel for 5 nights. The location was amazing- a lot of restaurants and shops nearby! The crew was very kind and helpful.The breakfast was very good as well.  I would definitely recommend this hotel for a family/couples vacation!
Jul 2015,50,Our favorite!,"The hotel was clean, comfortable and in a perfect location, and the hotel staff friendly and knowledgeable. We stayed at a number of other places in Portugal, but Hotel Santa Justa was our favorite of all of them. We would definitely go back. Can't recommend it enough."
Jul 2015,40,Lovely break,"We have just come back from 4 nights at the hotel- it was fab!  The staff were so helpful and friendly and the hotel was perfectly located close to everything.  You can get a taxi there from Lisbon airport for about 10 euro and the taxi driver had no problem finding the hotel.We stayed in a superior room the rooms was lovely, not huge but definitely big enough for us.  The addition of a welcome gift of port and custard tarts was a lovely touch.  The bathroom was huge with a massive shower and a few little bits that you may have forgotten like a toothbrush and razor.  There was also a mini fridge stocked daily with water, cola and even a beer.We ate in the restuarant one night too- the staters of prawns and beef carpaccio were lovely and really huge.  The steak was also nice but the fish wasn't the best that we've had which was a bit of a disappointment.  The desserts howver were lovely and the cocktail list was also great.I would definitely recommend this hotel for a break in Lisbon."
Jul 2015,50,1st class stay,"Modern hotel with a great central location although still quiet at night.  All the staff were helpful and friendly and all pre arranged airport transfers arranged through the hotel without were perfect.  Furthermore, other room preferences such as adjoining upper floor rooms were all met and emails to the hotel were responded to promptly.  The hotel is just a couple of minutes from the Santa Just elevator; about ten minutes stroll from the Tagus and a couple of minutes from the tourist buses and trams.  Rossio train station is a lazy 5 minute stroll away.  I recommend and would definitely use hotel Santa Just again on any future visit to Lisbon."
Jun 2015,50,Perfect location!,"HSJ is in a perfect location in the Baixa area of Lisbon and serves as a fantastic home base for exploring Lisbon. The Elevador de Santa Justa is a couple of blocks away giving walking access to the Chiado and Bairro Alto areas. Transportation (trams to Castelo Sao Jorge, metro, tour buses, etc. are only a very short walk away- one block to the Praca da Figuiera). The staff were very welcoming. Pedro spent a long time chatting about how to get around Lisbon and giving an introduction to this wonderful city. The minibar is stocked daily with a wide variety of liquid refreshments (which are included in the price of the room- something all hotels should consider). The bottle of port for two and pastries on arrival were also a very nice touch. Considering the location, I felt the room prices were reasonable. The decor is contemporary/modern but not sterile. I would gladly stay at HSJ on any trip to Lisbon. Great for couples. I stayed there with my family (including 5 kids) and it was great for us too. Very easy to stop back for a quick rest and drink for the little ones. The aggressive people trying to attract people to the restaurants next door were a bit annoying but not enough to ruin the experience of staying at HSJ. I just considered it a part of the unique character of Lisbon."
Jun 2015,40,Solid 4* with room for improvement!,"Stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa for 5 nights (6 days) with my parents in a ""suite with street view"" (room 405). On the whole our stay was extremely enjoyable but there were some areas where this hotel left us feeling somewhat let down so I'll just cut to the chase:Pros:- Check-in: Executed in a very professional and efficient manner by Joao. He was very welcoming and proceeded to not only hand us a map of the local area but was incredibly helpful and went out of his way to orientate us on the map then and there and pointed out good local restaurants for dinner that night as well as which places to avoid (e.g. the row of restaurants on the street the hotel is located on - Rua dos Correeiros). Seeing as when I travel I like to experience things like a local, he was more than happy to provide us with a list of restaurants he dines at himself. He also provided us with leaflets for various tours of Lisbon and Sintra that the hotel recommends for their guests. Throughout our stay Joao was really approachable and always looked genuinely happy to help regardless of how many questions you threw at him, he really is the epitome of great customer service! (Special mention also goes to Pedro for excellent communication skills and truly excellent seafood restaurant recommendations (Sacramento and Aqui Ha Peixe).)- LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION: This hotel could not BE better situated! The street the hotel is located on lies smack bang in between two of the city's main squares (Praca da Figueira (where most of the bus tours commence) and Praca do Rossio/Praca de D. Pedro IV)). As the name of the hotel suggests, the famous Santa Justa Lift (well worth a visit for the spectacular views – free if you purchase certain travel tickets like the metro pass etc.) is literally around the corner from the hotel. The nearest metro station (Rossio) is less than 2 minutes from the hotel (lift taking you down to the station is located in the middle of Praca da Figueira).- Breakfast: DO eat breakfast here and don’t rush it (it is deserving of your time - believe me!) and it’s definitely worth every penny! Breakfast is plentiful and of a very good standard including: amazing mini croissants and various other pastries, smoked salmon (unheard of in hotels of a similar standard in most other European countries), FRESHLY squeezed orange juice (not that god awful from concentrate stuff), chocolate powder and hot milk to make a really nice hot chocolate from scratch (wonderful surprise but then again I'm partial to a good hot chocolate), Nespresso coffee, a variety of cheeses and cold cuts, scrambled eggs, sunny side up eggs, bacon, sausages as well as the usual continental spread. It sets you up really nicely for a long day of sightseeing.Cons:- Do NOT pick a “suite with street view”/”family suite” (by the way they are the exact same room - advertised for either 3 adults or 2 adults and 2 children) unless the adult/child/children intending to sleep on the sofa bed is/are shorter than 160cm or 5' 2"" (I am 169cm/5’6 1/2” tall so this is just my estimation based on my height so forgive me if it’s not 100% accurate) because you will not fit on the sofa bed. When we informed reception of the fact that they should disclose this information online, the manager told us the only thing she could do was charge us €30 per night (her best offer in the end was €20 per night) to replace the sofa bed with a single bed. Now that may not seem like much but the fact is this kind of information at the time of booking would have been pertinent to our decision making process. Had we known better we would have booked the “family room” which comprises of two interconnecting rooms with two double (or twin) beds. We decided against replacing the sofa bed with a single bed because as it was the room was quite cramped so what little space we had to move around in would have become non-existent. As a result of there being no real solution for our problem, I had to resort to sleeping in a ball which of course isn’t ideal so for this reason I do not recommend 3 adults booking a “suite with street view” or 2 adults and a child/2 children booking the ”family suite” (unless you have really small kids or are a minion). - If you need anything important to get done steer clear of Claudia (I think that was her name - blonde lady) and the brunette wearing glasses on reception, as they are utterly incompetent at following simple requests like making restaurant reservations. One evening we wanted to have a special dinner at a very popular seafood restaurant called Aqui Ha Peixe and asked Claudia to call the restaurant and enquire whether we could book a table and if so to reserve a table for us for 19:00. Her colleague (brunette wearing glasses) called the restaurant up and very briefly conversed in Portuguese and then put the phone down very abruptly without having given our names to the restaurateur and informed us that we could turn up at 19:00 and that there would be a table ready for us. So, as one would, we took their word for it and turned up at the restaurant at 19:00 sharp, only to find to our dismay that no reservation had been made for us at all. The restaurateur was kind enough to let us dine in the waiting area of the restaurant instead of turning us away but as you can imagine it was the worst possible place you would ever want to sit to have a nice meal because we were literally sat in front of a queue of people staring at us while we dined. This was such a humiliating experience for us that the following morning we let Claudia know what had happened. I suppose at the very least we expected an apology from her and her colleague but instead she proceeded to argue with us (the hotel guests) insisting that we had never asked her to make a reservation thereby insulting both our integrity and intelligence. Claudia truly was the very definition of terrible customer service.- Dinner: Do NOT have your evening meal here even though you get a 10% discount as a hotel guest – it really isn’t worth it – not even if you just want a fuss free evening for the sake of convenience – it is not at all comparable to the breakfast! I had the salmon dish; it was clearly microwaved and was in short a gross offence to the otherwise exquisite seafood that Portugal has garnered so much repute for."
Jun 2015,50,Great weekend with friends,"Good quality hotel, very clean, excellent staff everyone is so helpful. Quality breakfast although restaurant in the evening is average . showers were very good good sized bathrooms and bedrooms and the beds were also very good.  Very well situated you can walk to many attractions from here or get on the yellow bus tours from the first stop.Highly recommended"
Jun 2015,50,Perfect Stay,"All went smoothly, staff is amazing, welcome drink - Porto wine, good coffee maker in the room, all is very clean, not even little bad smell anywhere in the hotel, just PERFECT location, all you need is around. Recommending to all travellers :)"
Jun 2015,50,Lovele staff,"We stayed there in August 2014 and return twice. the hotel is very well located, the food at the restaurant was really good ( we try dinner and breakfast buffet) but the best thing of this hotel is the staff. Many t hanks to all the staff you made our stay in Lisbon magic"
Jun 2015,50,Perfect location & friendly staff,"I have just spent a couple of days in Lisbon with my family (two teenaged daughters and my wife) and we stayed at this hotel. I found it using tripadvisor.com and i got to say, it surpassed our expectations by a wide margin. The location was great. Situated in a part of the old town on a ""pedestrian only"" street. walking distance to everything. The hotel is a four star rated hotel but as far as I'm concerned, it could have been a five star hotel. The staff was super friendly and helpful. This goes for the waiters and maintenance staff as well. We hade booked online about a month earlier and hade made a note to get two adjacent rooms. No problem. The room standard is very high and the hotel must have had a make over recently because every thing about the rooms was fresh. We had two rooms on the 5th floor and the bathrooms were roomy. Some features: AC, Mini bar (free), wifi (free), new towels every day, TV, safe (free). They also treated us with a small bottle of port wine and some of their local world famous pastries, Pastel de Nata. A nice touch i think.We had booked with breakfeast. A typical continental one with scrambled eggs, bacon, assorted bread and fruit. Coffee and tee of course. It was short of nothing. We also tried the restaurant one evening and they managed to deliver a tasty meal without breaking a sweat. What else? Oh yes. Every other night there was this two man band that came and played some great covers in the lobby for a couple of hours. They only had a keyboard and a small set of drums but man, did they know how to use them! They were absolutely fenomenal. their repetoar consisted of Motown classics and some newer stuff like Jamiroquai.On the same street as the hotel entrance there is a lot of ""tourist trap restaurants"". You know. The ones with the guy who stands outside the place in the middle of the street , trying to persuade anyone to come and get the meal of his life on HIS joint for almost no money at all. This may feel a bit awkward but after a couple of nights you almost get to now them and the jokes fly in the air when you turn their offers down yet another night. We were very happy with our stay and i do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone! I'm not gona bother looking for anything else on my next visit to Lisbon."
Jun 2015,50,Wonderful small hotel with a big heart,"Exceptional reception desk personnel. Helpful with everything. Clean, attractive rooms.  Only complaint is getting in and out of the tub/shower is a bit of a challenge unless one is blessed with long legs.  Very good breakfast buffet.  We didn't try their dinner menu but must admit the diners looked very pleased.  Location is very convenient for almost anything you want to do in Lisbon.   An unexpected and appreciated bonus was they expected you to drink what was placed in the room refrigerator at no cost and was replenished daily.  Since it was quite warm during our visit this was particularly enjoyed."
Jun 2015,50,Excellent hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa during a long weekend in Lisbon. It was perfectly situated in the city centre. It is walking distance from most sights, and close to tram stops if you want to go further afield, like Belem.The hotel itself was very nice, excellent service. The room was comfortable and quiet and we even got a little bottle of Porto and a custard cake as a welcome gift.The mini-bar in the room was also complimentary, which was great.I would definitely go back to the Santa Justa and have already recommended it to friends visiting the city!"
Jun 2015,50,2015 Lisbon family trip,"Excellent Hotel , great amenities , very centrally located in the heart of the city close to everything , public transportation , restaurants and shopping , we loved the very friendly staff that were always ready to help  and made our stay very enjoyable , i can highly recommend this  hotel and will definitely stay there again ."
Jun 2015,50,Outstanding boutique hotel right in town!!,"I could not be happier with my experience at this hotel. Wow! The front desk people were so helpful and chipper and the best part was...we got upgraded to a suite! Not sure why? But I will definitely go back when I visit Lisbon. The location was outstanding, right in the heart of the city on cobble stone streets. Very close to tram 28 and other attractions. Metro is super easy too and close right off La Rambla and where you want to be!! PLEASE STAY HERE if you are going to Lisbon. Cannot wait to go back! Thank you!"
Jun 2015,50,Excellent hotel in a great location,"Our stay at the Hotel Santa Justa was perfect from the moment we arrived. The person at the desk was expecting us. Our room was ready early. The room was spacious and well appointed with a very nice bathroom and amenities. The breakfast is excellent- lots of choice in a nice atmosphere in the main floor dining room. We had dinner one evening and found the food to be outstanding and very good wine.  I really enjoyed the duck with a fantastic orange risotto. The location of the hotel is ideal right in the heart of Lisbon. The front desk staff were very welcoming and helpful and gave us great suggestions of what to do. They booked a Fado restaurant for us, and we really enjoyed the quality of the singing and the meal. Although our room overlooked a restaurant street, the window are solid and we had a very quiet sleep. All in all a great 4 days in Lisbon."
Jun 2015,50,Fabulous Boutique Hotel!,Stayed at this hotel on vacation. Staff are helpful. Rooms are modern and very clean and overall a very quiet hotel despite the location being in the Center of town. Highly recommend. Complimentary breakfast has a large and unexpected variety of wonderful food to choose from.
Jun 2015,50,"Modern, clean and in the center of everything!","The reviews were right on regarding this hotel. I got the bed and breakfast package and it is worth it.  Relaxing breakfast buffet in the hotel includes eggs, bacon, sausage. Fresh fruit, meats and cheeses, pastries.  The room is modern and clean.  Kept my windows open the whole time and you can hear the noise from the street - but that didn't bother me.  If it does, close the window.  I loved the shower! It's one of those rain showers that spans half of the shower stall! Location - by the Elevador Santa Justa - 2 blocks over so it's in the middle of the action, but not where the crazy happens.  The staff is very helpful. I will be back!"
Jun 2015,50,Wonderful stay in the heart of Lisbon,Excellent hotel in the middle of the city. You can easly reach every corner of the city. We stayed on the 5th floor and the room was very quite. Good bed quality and a big bathroom. Very clean. We will return!
Jun 2015,40,Nice hotel in a Great location.,"Hotel was very well situated in a lively area and close to everything. The only issue is we felt bombared everytime we left or entered by all the restaurants outside the door, by the men trying to sell thier restaurants. Although they were very friendly about it, it was still rather annoying.The hotel itself was nice and modern. We had two rooms - a suite and a double. The suite was very comfortable with a sitting area with a pull our sofa and a couple of chairs. The bed was separtated with a sheer drape. The double room was of average size. Although the room was by an elevator, I have to say the room was very quiet.The staff was very friendly and helpful. We did not get the breakfast, but would say, that judging be what I saw, it wouldn't be worth it. There didn't seem to be many choices. There are several pastry shops around that were excellent as well as a healthy alternative around the corner with smoothies and fruits.Overall a great stay. Loved Lisbon! If you get the chance I recommend taking the train to Sintra to see the Pena National Palace. The castel was spectacular and the town was charming."
Jun 2015,50,Excellent Hotel,We stayed here for three nights and the hotel was beyond our expectations. The staff are all very friendly and willing to help. They gave us advice about getting around and helped to book dinner at another restaurant. The room was lovely and very clean. Breakfast had plenty of choice and food was delicious. Great location and easy to get to from the airport.
Jun 2015,40,Well Located Hotel,"Hotel Santa Justa is a clea and comfortable hotel in a good central location, although the street immediately in front is a bit touristy. Once inside, however, the hotel rooms are well appointed and the staff very friendly and helpful."
Jun 2015,50,Great Hotel,"We had a great stay!  The hotel is very clean, in a great location, and the staff are super friendly and helpful. Marianna, the receptionist at the front desk was so helpful and friendly.  When we arrived, she ran out to meet us and give us a parking pass.  She also made reservations for dinner for us, and got us acquainted with the our surroundings.  I'd definitely stay here again on my next visit to Lisbon."
Jun 2015,50,Amazing!,"Great hotel, from rooms to friendly staff and great location.  One of my best hotel experiences ever! The complimentary pastry and wine was a very nice touch. I would definitely go back. The area is a bit touristy but perfect if you want to be in the center of it all."
Jun 2015,50,Peace and quiet in a lively neighborhood.,"We had the combined ""family room"" which was extra nice, and was basically two separate rooms, each with doors able to close, combined by a small foyer. There was also a door that separated the foyer from the main hallway. (I hope that makes sense; it is sort of hard to describe).  The bathrooms, as mentioned in many other reviews, are deluxe and come with all amenities except hair conditioner (not unusual) and washcloth (also not unusual). The beds were excellent, the location is convenient to so much, and the staff super helpful. We drove into Lisbon after a road trip to the Algarve and Evora, and then returned our car, to a downtown location, rather than going back out to the airport. I wish I had paid more attention to the short term arrangement the hotel has with the nearby parking lot, for the unloading. My fault. This would certainly ease one's registration process. On the flip side, when we left for our departure to the airport, taxis are able to drive up to the door for pick up if you leave early in the morning. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, but it looked a cut above the other offerings on the street. The street itself, and the immediate neighborhood, is lively, and noisy. The amazing windows, and I mean amazing, eliminate every shred of noise. I'd like them in my own house! So, if peace and quiet is on your list of requirements, the Santa Justa is ideal. The staff was alert, attentive, and efficient.   The rooms were very well maintained. Relaxing stay."
Jun 2015,50,"GREAT hotel, SPLENDID service and PERFECT location",This is a hotel who gives personal service with a smile and really makes sure that guests are happy and accommodates you in a perfect way. The staff is 100% there to help you make your stay memorable!
May 2015,50,Perfect for a few days in Lisbon,"Hotel Santa Justa was a perfect hotel for our 3 day stay in Lisbon. The location is ideal for anyone interested in exploring the historical downtown area, as well as the more modern part of Lisbon on Avenida Da Liberdade. Easy walks to the Santa Justa Elevator, the Alfama, Barrio Alto, as well as a myriad of restaurants and shops. The staff was helpful, pleasant, and easy to engage about any topic. Nice extra treats, including a bottle of porto and welcome pastel de nada were a special touch. We had stayed in the hotel's sister property in Madrid and had enjoyed our stay there as well, so when we found out the hotels were related, we were quite pleased. Room was as advertised, great big window that opened (but also provided lots of quiet when closed), and decent size for a European hotel. Bathroom (especially the shower) is amazing!!  Only slight complaint is that the pillows on the bed are not super supportive and the bed itself is a little hard. Very minor gripes. I would totally recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit to Lisbon."
May 2015,50,Good Hotel in the centre of Lisbon,"We used the Santa Justa for a short weekend mini break in Lisbon. It's really good....both the rooms and service. We even got upgraded at no extra cost. They advertise continental breakfast which we pre-purchased but it also includes bacon and eggs.Even better is the location right in the heart of the city.....the main shops are on your door step, you can easily walk to the castle, river front, elevator, and big squares. Also the taxi rank and tram stop for Belham is just around the corner ......a 35 mins trip. We would visit at again.Well done."
May 2015,50,Beautiful hotel,"Really nice experience.Centrally situated, walking distance to main attractions. Really good service,very clean, personel always helpfull and polite but not always informed on current strikes and changes of trasportation programs.....I would definitly recommend it"
May 2015,50,Perfect,"Perfect location, very friendly employees and also the bar & restaurant is worth trying it. Everything worked fine and more central for a trip to Lissabon is simply not possible........................"
May 2015,50,Best location with great comfort,"Spent four nights upon arrival in Portugal. Great room on first floor with three balcony overlooks, large bed which hotel calls queen but really king sized. Rain shower as large as oversized shower stall. Breakfast buffet ranging from fresh fruits snd pastries to hot selections every day. Nice restaurant and bar for any needs including room service. Very quiet room. Great staff, especially Joao, Claudia at desk. Stay here if you can!"
May 2015,40,Great Location but avoid the Breakfast,We selected this hotel based upon other TripAdvisor comments and was not disappointed by either the location or the standard of room. The reception staff were also very helpful and sorted out and booked some restaurants for us. However do not take the breakfast as it has limited choice and the quality was poor. Given my choice again I would exclude breakfast as there are plenty of other choices on the doorstep. This somewhat spoiled the whole hotel experience for us!!
May 2015,40,Great location!,"Great location, modern rooms, very helpful receptionists. Hotel is nect to many attractions. The hotel had a band at night when I stayed there. Also, there was a restaurant at the hotel. I did not eat there but it looked pretty decent.n"
May 2015,40,3 Day Stay,"Enjoyed our stay in Lisbon in part to this Hotel and the great location.  The hotel is centered to many attractions and within walking distance to Castle St Jorge, Praca de Comercio and Convento de Carmo.  Good wifi, decent sized room and clean.  We did eat at the restaurants once but service was a bit slow so if your in a hurry try the Garnier shop a few blocks down on Rua Aurea."
May 2015,50,DC from Scotland,"Excellent hotel in an excellent location. We booked a suite which was large, modern and very clean. The room had three large windows each with their own small balcony.Staff were friendly and helpful."
May 2015,50,Excellent price /quality,"Excellent Hotel , friendly people  !   The room was clean, excellent quality of the bed , but some lack of clossits.The location in the middle of the city and the good price  makes the hotel an excellent choise !"
May 2015,50,I would stay here again,"I liked everything about my experience at this hotel. The rooms were nice sized and very clean and modern. The hotel went out of its way to include little extras which made the stay feel really special. There was a welcome treat when we got to the hotel, the mini bar was included in the room rate and we were given a half bottle of port. Further the hotel is in the middle of everything so you can walk most places or easily hope on a trolley if that is your preference. When I go back to Lisbon I will stay at this hotel again!"
May 2015,50,Very friendly and clean,We very much enjoyed this Hotel. It is in a perfect Situation but veryquiet and clean. The staff is very friendly and we always enjoyed a verydelicious dinnerWe would choose this Hotel again for our next trip
May 2015,50,"Fantastic hotel, highly recommended","Outstanding location, many sights are within walking distance. Very friendly staff. Delicious breakfast. Nice room, not really large but very quiet. Only disadvantage: Little space for personal belongings."
May 2015,50,Excellent Hotel,This hotel is very modern and located in the center of everything while being tranquil inside. The hotel staff Joao and Marianna were very helpful and knowledgeable about where to eat and what to see. We ate at the hotel restaurant and found the food very good as was the service. We would highly recommend the hotel.
May 2015,40,Great location,"I chose the hotel primarily for its location, only metres away from the historical Santa Justa lift.Staff at reception were very friendly and imparted with plenty of tourist information upon our arrival which I would suggest they give after guests have seen their room and have had a chance to freshen up.  It would be easy enough to put maps in the room.  When we checked in at the reception desk, one of the girls showed us a map and started scribbling access to whatever public transport, gave us info on being careful about pick-pockets, tours they could organise etc.  By the time she finished there was no way I could remember all the info she had given and moreover I was far more interested in getting to my room and freshening up after travel. Our room which was located on the 3rd floor was far more gloomy than what one would have expected from the website.  Walls of a dark taupe colour and soft, hidden lighting didn't help.   But everything was spotlessly clean. Great bathroom with a fabulous shower.  Though booked for 2 people there were only toiletries (soap, shampoo, shower cap) for one person - I asked reception for more and this was quickly provided.  The nespresso machine, little bottle of porto and nata pastries were a nice touch.  Television programs not great but then one doesn't go to Lisbon to watch television.  Wifi access in the room was slow.  Mattresses were very good.As there are many restaurants in the street below, it is impossible to sleep with the window open because of the noise of business going on below and later on stacking of chairs etc. When closed, windows were very effective in shutting out all street noise.  As it wasn't very hot yet we didn't try the air conditioning.I tried to read the information booklet provided in the room but it was impossible to read unless one had a magnifying glass - font cannot have been more than 6!Breakfast was good with quite a bit of variety and good coffee from the professional nespresso machine.   It became clear that they are not so helpful when they realise you are not going to book any trips through them.  When I asked where the station to travel to Sintra was, the receptionist vaguely waved behind her and said the station was on such and such a square.  There was a significant difference in helpfulness compared to the information I was bombarded with on arrival!Overall, I feel the hotel is overpriced."
May 2015,50,Great location. Very helpful staff,"Located in the pedestrian historical center close to everything in Lisbon. Reception staff was great in organizing restaurants, tours, and sorting out my lost wallet.Lisbon is a great location for a long May WE"
May 2015,50,Lovely hotel and staff,Our party ranged in age from 88 to 5 months. We found the rooms very comfortable.  The showers are amazing. We were glad we included breakfast in the booking as there was such a good choice. The staff are so attentive and nothing is too much trouble.  I would recommend this hotel.  The location makes it easy to get about.
May 2015,40,"Nice hotel, not perfect location","The hotel was very nice, beautiful room, great shower and mattress. Staff very nice (like every person in Lisbon), good WiFi, nice detail with the little bottle of Porto and the pasteis de nata.The only thing that for me was not perfect was the location, it was very safe, but is not in the nicest area of the beautiful city of Lisbon. Plenty of places to eat and very near the hop on hop off, but for the price I think we could have a nicer location."
May 2015,50,Very comfortable and convenient stay in the heart of Lisbon,"My spouse and I stayed here four nights during a two-week trip to Lisbon, Porto, and the countryside.  We had a very good experience.  Our room, for which we obtained a nice discount by paying in advance, was very comfortable and came with a lovely balcony overlooking the pedestrian street outside.  There was free in-room coffee; free (and functional) WiFi; a strong shower with reliable hot water; and tasteful decor.  The front-desk staff was polite and helpful with our questions (one of the staff gave us good recommendations for where to hear fado).  The location was great -- convenient to Bairro Alto/Chiado, the train station (Rossio), and the castle and Alfama (the old city).  Although the area immediately around the hotel is pretty dead at night, it's an easy walk to the city's best bars and restaurants.  If you stay here, we'd also recommend the pastelaria down the block at Praca da Figueira (Confeiteria Nacional), which has a lot of old-world charm and was our go-to place for breakfast."
May 2015,50,Perfect hotel in a central location,"We spent 4 days in Santa Justa hotel and we enjoyed it!This hotel is located in Baixa (Downtown), 5 minutes from the Rossio Subway and 5 minutes from the river. We did not need public transport due to the central location. There are several restaurants and bakeries close by, we liked the Browns Central Hotel for Breakfast and the Granier Bakery for pastries.Our room war rather small but very comfortable. The room was designed in the way that all of the space was well utilized. The interior is modern, the bed is excellent. We slept well, they have the best soundproof windows ever! We were also impressed by the large bathroom and the very good shower.The check-in was very quickly, the stuff was always friendly, our room was cleaned regularly. The free minibar was a nice touch.If we go back to Lisbon, we will stay here again."
May 2015,50,Excellent Hotel in Lisbon centre,"Stayed in this Hotel in April 2015.We were really pleased with our choice.  The overall hotel was modern and welcoming.  The standard room we had was clean, nicely decorated but not a vast amount of storage space - certainly adequate though.Breakfast was really good and well organised.Evening meal was of a very good standard too.Staff were cheerful, helpful and efficient at all times.Location was great for the centre and public transport in general.Would definitely recommend and would stay again."
May 2015,50,top hotel ln the city center,"Best location, excellent service, excellent breakfest. Just next to Elevador Santa Justa and to the river. Short walk to Bairro Alto.very friendly and helpful personal. No vehicle access after 10am.."
May 2015,50,Perfect place to explore Lisbon,"We loved this hotel and the kind and friendly service of the staff. It started with the check in where a very nice lady did not only welcome us to this place but gave us a 15 min overview of things we can do, the best places to eat and so on. We arrived and felt at home. The room was perfect, clean and modern. On the first evening we found a nice surprise in our room. The room also offers a ver clever idea: power sockets for US / UK / Europe that you won't even need an adapter. The location is excellent for exploring the city and also very close to tram / metro and train stations."
Apr 2015,50,Lisbon stay ,"This was a great hotel for out shirt stay in Lisbon.  It is centrally located.  A short walk to most of Lisbon's neighborhoods.  The rooms were great, Clean and stylish. The restaurant was solid for a nightcap as well.  The staff was fantastic as well.  If I go back to Lisbon I will stay there again."
Apr 2015,40,Excellent hotel,"Excellent hotel with excellent staff The only thing is related to the room , very little furniture specially comfort seating The location is very good Breakfast is very good value , dinner is a little pricy"
Apr 2015,40,In a heart of Lisbon,"Just minute important tourist attractions of Lisnons away from all of the most  imp. attractions of the Capital City.Friendly staff ,good food  but I would skip the breakfast next time.Clean ,bright rooms air conditioned and sound proof what is a necessity there.Be aware of  notorious attempt from people offering drugs everywhere in  the city centre.Plenty of bars and restaurants in the  area ere typical tourist traps  so do your research.Otherwise  an excellent choice."
Apr 2015,50,"Location, comfort and a smile","Thanks to the reviews on this website we chose Santa Justa for our stay in Lisbon.We definitely made the right decision!The location of this place is amazing. Right in the middle of the old city centre.Most sites at walking distance. Around the hotel are lots of nice restaurants for just a drink with a nice view or a good meal.The hotel is very comfortable, clean, surprisingly soundproof and has a pleasant ambiance.Nicely decorated, provided with toiletries and a good and varied breakfast.Staff was very helpfull in any way, always with a smile and in perfect English."
Apr 2015,50,Excellent!,"Location:  Absolutely perfect.  One block from Rossio Square... two from the elevator... one from the tram and hop-on-hop off busses ... one from the metro.Staff:  Super helpful with everything from checking-in to recommendations for places to eat and how to get to the sights. Very accommodating to children.Sleep Quality:  Very comfortable beds.  We had a room overlooking the street and it was very quiet with the windows closed.Cleanliness:  Perfect.  Room service was prompt and excellent.  Super clean room.Room:  We stayed in a family room.  The sofa pulls out into a bed and that area is separated from the main bed by a curtain you can pull closed.  A nice, well equipped, and spacious.  They restock the refrigerator each day with juice, water and beer and it is free.  You are given a complimentary bottle of port and sweets upon check in. Internet:  Fast and free.Breakfast:  A bit expensive (as expected in a hotel) at 15 Euro... but everything was fresh and well prepared.Dinner:  We had a nice risotto and sandwich in the restaurant for dinner.  Food was good and the staff was excellent.  Kid Friendly:  Spacious family rooms.  High-chairs in the breakfast/restaurant area.  To get there:  We took the metro to Rossio square and walked the block to the hotel.  It was easy and the metros are clean and reliable.  However, it was much more time consuming than a taxi and there are a lot of elevators to go in as you switch trains, etc.  It was difficult with a stroller and bags but is was like 1.60 per person.  We had the hotel arrange for a cab which drove directly to the hotel entrance (early morning flight).  It cost 20 euro to get back to the airport but was worth it.Overall:  Best described as a large boutique hotel.  4-star service.  Excellent rooms.  Great housekeeping.  Kid friendly.  Nice small restaurant.  No 5-star amenities like a gym or pool."
Apr 2015,40,Great Location!,"My husband and I went on a weekend getaway to Lisbon for his birthday and stayed one night at Santa Justa. The hotel is in a fantastic location in the heart of downtown. Everything is within walking distance which is perfect for a short break. The room was beautifully modern. We got upgraded to a suite when we arrived which was awesome. We also had dinner that night in the hotel as it was a bank holiday and everything was closed, and the food was outstanding for a hotel restaurant. I would definitely stay here again and 100% recommend this hotel"
Apr 2015,50,Everything we wanted in a central location,"We stayed here in April as a group of two couples.The location of the hotel is very central for sightseeing and easy to find. There are local tram stops but you can pretty much walk everywhere. Upon arrival the hotel has a welcoming reception area and the staff were friendly. They assisted us with maps, information and made a dinner reservation for us. We were allowed to check in early which is always good.Our room was modern, clean and spacious. The bathroom was fantastic with everything you'd need. The free minibar is a nice touch. As was the complimentary mini bottle of port on our first night!! The bed was huge and very comfortable, and as the hotel is quiet and has blackout blinds we slept well.Breakfast was really good and there was so much choice of fresh fruits, meats, breads, cereals and custard tarts!!!For what we paid I think it was good value. I have given this hotel 5* not because I believe it is a 5* hotel per se, but for what it says it is and for what we wanted, it was excellent!"
Apr 2015,50,Large clean modern rooms in great location,"This hotel was an excellent pick for our group of 4 travelers which included myself and 3 children ages 10-13.  The hotel is a very convenient location such that it is easy to take the subway from the airport to a stop only 1 block away.  The location is in the heart of many of the main tourist attractions and the main shopping plaza. It is an easy 10 minute walk to the coastal monuments and walk way.  Our room had a king sized bed and a fold out twin sofa bed.  The bath contained both a shower and a Jacuzzi tub.  best of all was a separate toilet stall. There were thick pull down shades on the windows that let us sleep in to help a slow acclimation to the local time zone. Also because the hotel is on a pedestrian walkway there is no loud traffic or horns to keep you up at night.  The front desk staff was knowledge about local attractions, transportation routes and were able to provide us with discounted tickets to the aquarium.  Without hesitation I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again myself. The only negative I can think of is the restaurant.  I would not recommend eating there.  We did the first night and the food was subpar.  My daughter  and I shared a dish with shrimp in it and we both had GI problems for several days afterward."
Apr 2015,50,"A One Night Stay, but Very Good","We were only in Lisbon for one night unfortunately (wish it had been longer), but our stay at the Hotel Santa Justa was just perfect for what we needed.  It's location is ideal.  It is centrally located, and just a short distance from the main square where open top tour buses and trams start and terminate.  As well as having it's own restaurant it is pretty much surrounded by others so you are spoilt for choice (we went to the Food Temple (Vegan), which was about a 10 minute walk and was wonderful). It's about a 30 minute walk up to the castle, but be warned it's uphill!Our room was very nicely appointed and lacked nothing that we needed for our short stay.The staff on reception were very helpful.  We arrived early and they took our cases and put them away securely.  When we returned later that day our cases were ready in our room.  Upon arrival also we asked for guidance on tours, and we were given comprehensive and helpful advice that allowed us to make an informed choice about which tour to pay for.  The following day when we left the staff ordered a taxi for us which turned out to be very reasonably priced (in comparison to what we had been lead to expect for a transfer to the airport)Would we stay again?  Absolutely."
Apr 2015,50,"Comfort & friendliness, the hallmarks of Santa Justa",An excellent choice as a base from which to visit Lisbon. Multi-lingual staff were helpful with all our requests for the best tips to visit this most interesting city. So quiet during the night in spite of central location.
Apr 2015,50,In the heart of city center,"Excellent service and great location. Nice rooms with balconies, I'm not sure if all room are equipped with a balcony though. Near to taxis, metro, trams and buses. And the tuk-tuks of course. A lot of restaurants and cafes in the area. Just a few minutes walk to the river. Highly recommended."
Apr 2015,50,"Design, location and service!","We arrived at the hotel after a very stressful day due to another French air controllers strike. The receptionists were so kind, they made us relax, laugh and feel at home immediately. We liked just about everything about the Santa Justa: the staff, the central location, the cool interior design, the beautiful rooms, the soundproof windows, the free drinks in the mini bar, the free Wifi, the marble bathroom--and the marvellous shower. We ate at the hotel restaurant twice during our stay and were very favourably impressed: good food and very friendly, efficient staff. It is really hard to find anything to criticize at all. Maybe this: Coffedrinkers are clearly much better off at the Santa Justa than teadrinkers like us. But who really cares so much about tea when everything else is just right...?"
Apr 2015,40,A great city centre hotel,A good city centre hotel with excellent service and very friendly staff (loved the additional touches like the free chocolates and bottle of port in the room). Also room was made up as a double but no problem having it made in a twin as was sharing with a friend. Great location for getting out and about in Lisbon. I would definitely stay here again.
Apr 2015,50,Location and service!,We didn't have any reservations for our stay in Lisbon and got extremely fortunate that this hotel had any rooms.  The location was amazing.  The beds were very comfortable.  The service though was makes the hotel stand apart from the rest.  The manager was amazing and gracious.  The front desk staff were very helpful.  Loved it very much.
Apr 2015,50,Best for staying in the centre of Lisboa,"Nice staff, fine rooms (no carpet on the floor, which means much more better smell and better feeling than expierienced in many City Hotels before) - bathroom all over dressed in marble and not as tiny as usual. Beds are very comfortable, too. Hotel situated in perfect location - only a few steps to: Tram, Metro, a lot of Restaurants, the Tejo and so on. And: quiet during the night! I can recommend this Hotel to everyone and I for myself would prefer to stay there again when visting Lisboa once more."
Apr 2015,50,Fantastic location,"The most important thing about the hotel is its wonderful location. In the very centre of Lisboa, yet not by the main street. It is in a walking distance from most of the popular places worth seeing, 3min of slow walk from nearest subway.The rooms are clean and cosy, beds comfortable as hell. The staff is helpful and friendly. Can't say bad thing about breakfast. Everyone should find something he likes. The Wi-Fi works extremly smoothly for a free service.The only downside I can think of is fullfiling expectations. I was anticipating more spacious rooms. The pictures I had seen before enhanced reality a little bit. But did not change the fact they were really nice and comfortable.I would definitely visit again."
Apr 2015,50,The best Hotel in Lisbon,"This must be one of the best Hotels in Lisbon. You will meet staff that are so friendly that its unbelivebel. The location is in the centre, the rooms are cousy, what more can you want. Beeing a guest at this hotel you will feel special. You get a gift (suprice), the room is clean and has all facilities you need."
Apr 2015,50,Fantastic,"Very good service and location is the best ever. The restaurant was good, but the breakfast a little bit poor.The interior was very modern and the room was very clean.The staff in the restaurant and in the reception was very helpful."
Apr 2015,50,A home away from home,"After extensive research, our family decided on an inclusive hotel/flight Expedia trip. TripAdvisor was our main guiding force. As there is absolutely nothing negative to say about our flight/stay in Lisbon, we find it more pertinent to address the highlights of our visit. Excluding the obvious charm and glory of Lisbon and its sorrounding areas, our six night stay at Hotel San Justa was first and foremost the main reason why we so much enjoyed our trip- Facilities: its walking access location to everything you want to see or do, superior/impecably clean facilities and modern bathroom at a reasonablle price, great sleep courtesy of room quality and exceptional sound-proofing; Services: outstanding staff guidance to get around, shop and restaurants, superb breakast buffet in its cozy front area, free in-room wifi and mini bar ammenities; Service: simply, extraordinary staff and housekeeping- get to know Pedro, Joao and Ricardo at the front desk and you will never want to leave the hotel, or Lisbon for that matter. It's relevant to mention that their recommendation to get to know Lisbon and its metro area intimately utilizing the personalized services of IGO Portugal was the second best decission we made, and certainly the right complementary action towards our ""best reason"" to our trip enjoyment. In merging the aforementioned elements, and finding ourselfs 8,000 miles away from from home, Hotel San Just just felt like a second home- or more likely a home away from home."
Apr 2015,50,Great stay,"Enjoyed our stay - comfortable room, spacious bathroom, plentiful breakfast. Complimentary parking.  Exremely helpful, nice and professional staff. Great location.  The only con is that the hotel is on a pedestrian street and is a bit difficult to access if driving. Would definitely recommend, particularly for families."
Apr 2015,50,Excellent Hotel,This is an amazing hotel at a very affordable price. Centrally located and surrounded by many little restaurants and easily in walking distance of the river and the busier nightlife areas.The staff was very friendly and helpful. the room clean neat and comfortable.A definite yes to staying there again.
Apr 2015,40,You just got to love this wonderful hotel....,"Our first stay in Lissabon so also in this hotel.  The location is excellent. Close to so much places to visit or see... The staff is very, very friendly. We were surprised about the rooms: very clean, lots of space, free minibar, free coffee/tea, and a little bottle of port to welcome us...If I have one point of criticism, it must be the space and number of tables during breakfast. If there was to be more space, we would have given 5 stars in stead of 4...Breakfast itself is excellent, the buffet gives you plenty of choice...We had dinner in the hotel's restaurant one evening: very friendly waiters, excellent meal.In short...Next time we visit Lissabon, it will be in this same hotel again."
Apr 2015,40,Great time in Lisbon,"We had a fantastic three night stay at Hotel Santa Justa, the hotel is in a great location in the middle of Lisbon, close to Metro and Rail links. The road the hotel is on has lots of restaurants with some determined owners touting for business but apart from that location could not really be better. The staff were probably the best I have come across, the desk staff obviously loved and we're proud of their city and were really enthusiastic about what to do and see, giving us lots of help about what to do and where to go. We were made some personalised cocktails in the bar which were lovely and although we didn't eat at the hotel the food looked fine and was reasonably priced. The room was very quiet for a central location and had a great shower room. It was quite small although it was the budget end for the hotel. We would have liked tea making facilities not just coffee but we are English.  All in all I would recommend the hotel very highly"
Apr 2015,50,"Friendly staff, perfect location","It was my 4th time in Lisbon and I will come back! The hotel was in perfect location, very near to the market place and Rossio Plaza. The hotel had everything necessary and the staff was always helpful."
Apr 2015,50,"Excellent Hotel , location and staff","A very well located hotel ,so that we could walk to all attractions, comfortable rooms and we could sleep well without any noise from the outside.A nice surprise when they left in our room 1 bottle of Port and 2 pasteis de nataAll the staff were very good specially Mariana who welcomed us like we were good friends and she was very helpful helping us to sort out a problem with a tour to Fatima All the staff were very helpful and friendly..The breakfast have a great choice of things to choose from,We definitely come back and recommend  this hotel."
Apr 2015,50,Won't stay anywhere else in Lisbon!,"From the moment we arrived and were greeted by Joao on reception we were treated like returning friends. Antonio, Arthur, Miguel, Diana and all the restaurant staff were a credit to the hotel and went out of their way to make our stay special. Claudia and Pedro on reception were extremely knowledgable about the city and gave good advice on places to visit. The journey to the hotel from the airport took 30 minutes at 8.30pm and cost 12 euros. On the return on a Sunday at about 1pm it was the same. The taxi drops you in Praca da Figuiero (great food market open till late in the centre of it) and you only have to walk about 100metres down a cobbled pedestrian precinct to find the hotel. The area surrounding the hotel is mainly pedestrianised and it would be sensible to take good walking shoes or at least flat shoes as I saw many women tweeting on high heels having more than a little trouble!The room was on the fourth floor overlooking the street with a small balcony. Very quiet, good air con, on the small side but to be expected with an old building and a super kingsize very comfortable bed, quality sheets and fluffy bath towels. The shower was huge with marble walls and floor and a rainforest shower head as well as a normal telephone handle type. Both very powerful. Free safe and hairdryer supplied as well as water,a free minibar and small ironing board and iron. They'd thought of everything. There was a welcoming small bottle of port and some 'pastel de nata' pastries. (Portuguese custard tarts to die for!) We wanted to see some Fado as Portugual is famous for this passionate music so we asked reception to book an evening meal at Faia's, this didn't disappoint, more pricey than normal but excellent food and wine and exceptional Fado singers, just a shame I couldn't understand what was being said! Breakfast was served in the restaurant and was copious, with fresh fruit , cereal, pastries, ham and cheese and a couple of hot dishes. Hot coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice  and tea and all served buffet style. We ate two evening meals here and they were delicious and very reasonably priced/Lots to do and see in Lisbon. A trip to the castles of Sintra is a must with the rail station only about five minutes away and then a 45 minute journey costing only 9 euros for the two of us return. If you do visit Sintra search out a dingy pink or red brick building called the Dona Maria restaurant, the  interior of the dining room is decorated with original 18th century paintings and the food is delicious. Like stepping back in time! another place to hunt out is the Mercado de Ribeira opposite the rail station near the sea ( there are 2 stations in Lisbon) There is a huge undercover market hail which has been made in to a large restaurant/food hall with chairs and tables in the middle and every sort of food style imaginable around the outside to choose from. It opens from 11am till 2am. I can't wait to return and will certainly stay at Santa Just a again due to the excellent staff and the central location."
Apr 2015,50,"Great hotel, great location","Fantastic hotel great location, very central. Rooms are very well stocked with shower gel, shampoo, comb, sponge, sewing kit etc. Mini bar in room free of charge, stocks 1 bottle of beer and the rest are soft drinks and water. Once in room a waitress brings up a bottle of port and 2 patisseries, also 2 chocs as well. Shower is fantastic its a rain shower, breakfast consists of cereal, fruit, yoghurts, ham, cheese, toast, bacon,eggs(scrambled,boiled and fried) and not forgetting the pastries. Staff are very polite, the meal we had in the restaurant was 1st class. Would def stay again"
Apr 2015,50,"Great location, nice Hotel","This hotel is very coneniently located in a pedestrian zone, from where the whole Baixa can be reached easily by foot. The rooms are small but nicely furnished and in spite the view of the busy road, very quiet.Wireless is free and fast. The showers have a very nice rain feature. But there are hardly any plugs for charging phones, tablets etc, which is a drag. So make sure you get a second room key so you can charge your devices when you are not in the room, because when you leave, electricity is out, if you pull the key out of the common receptacle.Breakfast is good, ok selection, good quality of food.The personnel and the service the offer is impeccable and friendly.Keep in mind, the restaurant of the hotel is good and not one of the tourist traps as most of the other establishments nearby. They offer a very nice selection of good portugese wines."
Apr 2015,50,Classy place and great location,"This place is just what you'd hope for in a Hotel. Obviously the location is right in the centre of town, but the staff were very friendly and helpful, and the buffet breakfast was good  quality and varied. Our room ( a superior double) was very clean and well equipped , although not huge. The receptionists were always happy to recommend places to eat and make the booking for us. Would definitely stay here again"
Mar 2015,40,Very friendly and helpful staff,Great Location.You are in the middle of the city.Very friendly and helpful staff.The rooms are modern and nice.Good bed.A charming hotel and with a few steps you can pick up your car from the garage for a moderate daily flat rate.There is one negative aspect:After 10 am it is not possible to reach the hotel with the car either for check in or check out but the bell boy or the ladies at the desk are very helpful so there should be no problem .
Mar 2015,50,Great,"Very good location for sightseeing, quiet, central. Comfortable beds and pillows. Friendly staff.  See other reviews for details. Close to metro stations and restaurants, just not good restaurants. Close to good shopping on Barrio Alto."
Mar 2015,40,Boutique hotel in excellent location,"This cozy, cool hotel has charm, class and charisma.  The rooms are fitted with multiple lighting options to set your mood, comfortable beds, plush towels and puffy pillows that allow you to melt into dreamland. Upon my midnight arrival I was pleasantly surprised in my room with a complimentary small bottle of porto and delicious custard cream cakes.  The next morning I made use of the Krups/Nespresso coffee machine in the room before heading down for breakfast. The perfect late night treat.  It is located very close to Praca Figueira and a short walk through the hilly, winding streets and stairways to St. Georges Castle.  Yet, it is located on a quiet street.The breakfast buffet was simple and fulfilling - multiple breads, pastries, salmon, meats, cheese, fresh orange juice, eggs, sausage, fruit, yogurt, and cereal.  Do not be fooled in the morning when it appears dark - the street is blocked from the morning sun - in my case, once I left the hotel I was met with crystal clear blue skies and sun in abundance. Hotel staff (front desk in particular) could have been a bit friendlier."
Mar 2015,50,Right in The Heart of It!!! CLEAN CLEAN As good as it Gets!!!,The family room was perfect.  Couldn't have asked for a better hotel.  100 yard walk to 2 different metro stations. Excellent breakfast.  Quiet. Service topnotch. Perfect english speaking etc.  Have traveled europe with my 2 daughters (19/21) and always want the hotel experience to be as good as it can be for the price.  This was grade A+
Mar 2015,40,Nice hotel -great location,+ Very friendly staff. Nice clean hotel. Free Water and soft drinks free provided in room. Very good breakfast. Good value. Good location in centre of old town reasonably quiet. Fantastic power shower.- rooms a bit small and dining (breakfast) area small making it difficult to get a seat at peak time.
Mar 2015,50,"Invested, caring and knowledgable staff!","The Santa Justa staff are extremely helpful and very polite. They are attentive to detail, confident and have a great sense of humour. Our room was exactly what we expected (the shower is amazing!) and the pictures on the site do it justice. The balcony is a bit small but this is the style in all of the downtown - we did manage to put two small chairs out there and enjoyed a glass of port while listening to 2 accordion players serenade those having lunch in the rua's charming restaurants. Our hotel stay included breakfast which consisted of delicious pastries, cheeses, fresh fruit, cereal, bacon/sausage, eggs, smoked salmon and lots of other things. We didn't manage to dine there for dinner but it is a great spot for a drink and their menu looked interesting (although limited). Our room was on the 4th floor, we didn't have an ""ocean"" view but there were lots of interesting sights from our balcony!My wife had arranged for a bouquet of flowers to be delivered and these were beautifully arranged along with a nice welcome of port and chocolate from the hotel. The staff were able to provide recommendations for several inexpensive Fado bars (many require that you come for a full service dinner followed by a performance - we opted out as we customarily ate at our favourite spots), a fun queer dance bar and recommendations for a few well-known spas. We especially enjoyed the BSPA in Belem, what a treat to all the senses after visiting so many beautiful sights!!I would recommend booking a sight seeing trip with Go2Lisbon. Our guide Vlade was delightful and he had lots to say about the country's history and each site we visited. Our group appreciated the extra time and attention he provided to us. Just a note if you book the Sintra day trip, bring gravol as the drive around into the mountains can make your stomach weak!We really enjoyed visiting Baixa, Bairro Alto - Chiado and Alfama. All the areas around this hotel are gems and one can easily tour the neighborhoods on foot. We loved the pastries at Cafe Brasileira and although I really liked the cod (my wife not so much) we often found ourselves at Gandhi's Palace. Who knew you had to go to Portugal for the absolute best Indian food!In all I would highly recommend this hotel. Our stay was perfect and we would definitely visit again."
Mar 2015,50,"Fabulous,welcoming hotel in a great location.","My daughter and I spent two nights in Santa Justa hotel, The room was very comfortable, and although we were on the 2nd floor overlooking the street ,there was very little noise. Complimentary Port and a free mini bar stocked with soft drinks and a beer were very welcome. This was our first visit to Lisbon, but soon realized we had struck gold with our choice of hotel, the situation was fantastic for exploring the city and very close to the tram stop, metro station, great shopping and fantastic restaurants. The staff were excellent and so helpful and friendly, we would definitely stay there again."
Mar 2015,50,"Perfect location for sightseeing. Lovely rooms, friendly staff.",The view from our rooftop room was stunning. The room was well appointed and very comfortable. We particularly appreciated the UK 3 pin socket as well alongside the traditional 2 prong. Staff were very friendly and helpful.
Mar 2015,50,Lovely hotel in centre of lisbon,"My wife and I spent 4 nights in Santa justa hotel, The hotel is in a great location in the centre of the city perfect for exploring the city. The staff were great,always helpful and very friendly. The room was very modern with a large ,comfortable bed,free safe and free mini bar which was restocked every day with water,soft drinks and a beer,the shower is amazing with a huge shower head  We had breakfast only one day and was fine but at €15 for continental or €19 for hot food was expensive,there are plenty of restaurants around the hotel"
Mar 2015,50,Perfect location,Great location for sightseeing and local atmosphere. Very good breakfasts. Comfortable room. Interesting shower. Enjoyed the complimentary port in room. We would recommend city bus tours - especially the old trams.
Mar 2015,50,Great hotel & location!,"My daughter and I spent 3 nights during Spring Break. This was a perfect location for both of us with access to sites, restaurants, the waterfront and transportation around the city.  The Hotel staff were friendly and the superior room was comfortable and spacious. Breakfast was worth the 15 euros. We will be back next time we are in Lisbon!"
Mar 2015,50,Great Stay,Stayed 3 nights March. Everything excellent from start to finish. Very helpful staff on reception with good recommendations for restaurants etc. Breakfast at 15 euro is good value as a single coffee in the area can cost 2.50-3.00 euro Will be back again
Mar 2015,50,Amazing food and great service!,"Me and two friends spent the weekend in Lisbon celebrating our 21st. We decided to dine in the restaurant on the Friday evening to celebrate, and were not disappointing! The staff were very friendly, the food was served promptly and was amazing (Tuna Steak and sweet potato)! We also had some lovely cocktails and they were extra accommodation when they noticed it was my friends birthday, bringing out a birthday dessert!"
Mar 2015,50,Great hotel right in the downtown,"I was travelling through Lisbon on my want to other destinations and needed a last minute booking. Santa Justa was perfect. I could go out easily around town, but when I wanted quiet and time to work, the room was ideal without much noise. Further, the restaurant/bar is worth the price - surrounded by normal 'touristy' places, but with quality seafood and excellent service."
Mar 2015,50,great hotel - close to river,"We booked here for first time, and thought it was a great hotel. It is a boutique style of hotel, and could be a bit pricey for some, but great value for money. Less than 5 minutes walk from river, and close to lots of shops and restaurants, in the old part of town. Lots to see and do within a few minutes walk. Rooms very well equipped. Service from staff was excellent.Soundproofing of windows was excellent. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
Mar 2015,40,Good hotel and great location,"The hotel is in the heart of the city, easy to go anywhere, nice people in the front desk always. The room small but I asked to be change for an additional fee and it did work well. Room were very clean and nice bathroom. I will stay there next time when I go to lisbon. I do not hesitate to recommend.They contacted me a couple, Pedro and hir wife. To give my wife and I a tour. Great and nice people., if you want to know the real Lisbon you need to do it with them. They will take you to places where only locals visit, they made the visit much better and enjoyable."
Mar 2015,50,City break,We chose this hotel as it was Trip Advisors city break hotel of the year. We weren't disappointed. We stayed 4 nights. Lovely modern hotel centrally located in quiet pedestrianised street. Metro and trams only a 5 minute walk. Well equipped bedrooms. Excellent breakfast. Ate in restaurant a couple of times. Food was again excellent. Staff throughout our stay were very helpful.
Mar 2015,50,Recommend hotel for a pleasant city trip to Lisbon,"Hotel Santa Justa is the perfect hotel for discovering Lisbon,situated nearby the train station and ""tram 28"" and the Santa Justa elevator (must see)Staff is friendly and helpful, restaurant is recommended for a nice dinner :-)Breakfast is perfect to start the day and the bar is the perfect spot to end it.Don't hesitate to book a room in hotel Santa Justa, you will enjoy it (as we did)"
Mar 2015,50,Delightful,"If only all hotels were like the Santa Justa! The previous reviews have said it all; right in the centre and yet so  quiet. As a previous reviewer said, its the little things, like the free soft drinks and the lit magnifying mirror and good hairdryer in the bathroom. The staff were helpfull and friendly and I have to thank them particularly for spotting it was my birthday and putting a gift and message in the room.Highly recommended"
Mar 2015,50,Excellent hotel good location,Dont hestate perfect hotel in good location thank you mr Joao  Andrade for your help excellent service i will defently return to this hotel  what i missed in breakfast a tomato or cucamber but this is a small issue
Mar 2015,50,Great Find,"Found this hotel on the old interweb looking for a 3 night stay. What a find. In the centre of this lovely city. The Staff were excellent , the room was spotless very modern only 18 months old, everything you could ask for a free minibar replenished every day. The food was good. We ate here 2 nights but there is plenty of good eating places around. We found as usual a good english pub the george. By the metro. But everything about this place was great would highly recommend the Santa Justa for a Lisbon city break. To anyone. We will deffo come back here."
Mar 2015,50,A Jewel in a Jewel of a City,"This is the best designed hotel we have ever stayed at, in all ways. The central location is perfect for walking everywhere. The staff are well trained, courteous, helpful and multilingual. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and very clean. Very sound proof. Good air handling. Very flexible lighting. Big screen TV. WiFi that actually works. Plus lots of small amenities that make the difference: a safe, an ironing board & iron, a free minibar, soft cozy linens and a Nespresso machine.I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and I will definitely stay here when I return to Lisbon: a fabulous city."
Mar 2015,50,Top Location and service,"The hotel is located in a very good location, in the middle of action and many attractions are within walking distance. Both the Rossio and Cais do Sodre railway stations are within reach by walk.It's just a 1-2 minutes walk to Praça da Figueira to take a tram or Hop-on-off bus. We are very satisfied with our stay here. During check-in and check-out we were greeted by Claudia with a big smile. She has provided us information about the hotel and places surrounding the hotel. All the hotel staffs were really polite and friendly. The room was clean and in an appropriate size. The bathroom was big, bigger than the standard European standard.The free Wi-Fi was quite fast and we had no problem with connection at all. We were very impressed of the free mini bar selection provided. There were different kind of drinks you can choose from (fruit juices, water, beer, coke, Sumol, tonic water, etc). Not to be missed, it was a nice touch from the hotel to provide complimentary Pastel de Nata and a small bottle of Porto wine upon our arrival.Many restaurants can also be found within walking distance from the hotel and next to the hotel. Don't be put off by the guys standing along the street keep asking you to dine in their restaurant, we just ignored them every time we passed by and after a few times rejection from us they gave up.Conclusion, two thumbs up to Hotel Santa Justa and the staffs. We will be back again the next time when we visit Lisbon. It's the best place to stay, especially if it's your first time visiting Lisbon like us."
Mar 2015,40,Nice design hotel,"Smartly decorated rooms and an easy walk to anyplace. The breakfast is good; fresh juice, nice croissant, eggs, etc. Good value for price and they serve nice cocktails after a long day of touring! The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Great sleep. Quiet rooms and very comfy beds and pillows!The only drawback is that to enter the hotel you have to walk by people who constantly approach you to go to their restaurants. Were they to disappear I'd give it another star."
Mar 2015,40,sightseeing trip,"Just returned from a 4 day break here, lovely hotel - location is terrific! Staff are very helpful, room lovely and clean - room actually resembles the photo you see on website! We had a 5th floor room, view was a bit strange - into local residents' apartments, but there were no privacy issues. Minibar a bonus, used the water, tonic and orange juice regularly. Loved the nespresso machine ( took an extra couple of our own capsules as well) - overall, would recommend this hotel for couples or those on business trips. Loved the city, a perfect trip"
Mar 2015,50,location and service,The hotel is in an excellent location within easy walking distance of many attractions and resturants. As it is located in a predestrian area there is no traffic noise. The staff were very friendly and helpful
Mar 2015,40,Great Hotel for City Break,"My husband and I have just returned from a 3 night break at this hotel.  This was a surprise birthday trip from my husband.On arrival, we were welcomed by a pleasant young lady, who gave us some useful information on the area.The room was spacious (albeit a little dull due to it being an attic room with a small window) and clean.  The bathroom was large with a good shower and toiletries supplied.The hotel had given me a lovely bottle of bubbly and birthday cake, which was a lovely touch and something other hotels haven't done in the past for special occasions.  On returning from our evening meal on the first night, there was a small bottle of Porto and two small cakes to welcome us the their hotel - again, another lovely touch.There was good entertainment on the Saturday evening, although we were the only residents there, but we got a few canapes supplied free of charge, which again was a special touch.If there is one thing that I felt let this hotel down, it was the breakfast.  Slow to fill the hot food items and not very well laid out.  (e.g. the tea bags were beside the rolls, jam, butter etc, instead of being beside the coffee maker).  Although we seen some residents being shown around the breakfast area, explaining where everything was, we didn't get that information passed to us.Very central hotel and in good location, would definitely use this hotel again!Thank you to all the staff who made this a pleasant stay."
Mar 2015,50,great location and amazing room!!!,EVERYTHING WAS THOUGHT FOR GUEST WELLBEING...*3 types of wall socket (you dont need to worry about adapter)*hair dryer*magnifying mirror*iron + iron board*safe*luggage rack*shoe-horn*bath sponge*door catch (its used to keep the room door opened to go in and out with luggages)PERFECT AND CLEAN.
Mar 2015,40,Great experience,We stayed here for a long family weekend. Great location in the center. Rooms are great with nuce design especially the superior room. Service is great. Breakfast is fine but too small space when crowded. This is the only area of improvement all the rest is great.
Mar 2015,40,Super hotel!,"Easy booking on clear website. Reasnable price considering the very central location and 4*. Very nice personnel throughout - especially Jassir in the restaurant! Very good food, nice and varied breakfast. The Superior room, while not very big, was modern and nicely laid out, with a small balcony over the pedestrian street below. Completely quiet even during the day, when the double-glazing Windows were shut. Good air conditioning. Overall a nice experience. For a return trip to Lisbon we will choose the Hotel Santa Justa again."
Mar 2015,50,First rate hotel,"We stayed for four days at the Hotel Santa Justa , which deserves more than its four stars.  The hotel sent acknowledgement of our booking, and a day or so before we set off we received an email to say they were awaiting our arrival, and was there anything they could do for us. We felt like royalty !The hotel is easy to find if you use the Airobus and get off in Rossio square .All the staff give you a smile, and nothing is too much trouble for them; a sign that there is a good boss behind the scenes.The rooms are small, but well designed, oh and we wish we could take the bathroom home with us, it is superbly designed. The best shower I have had the privilege of standing under!The hotel is situated in the pedestrianised area of Lisbon, the windows are double glazed, so no problems with noise from the street.It's a five minute walk to the river front, with lots of restaurants in the area. My advise is to read TA as the one night we didn't the meal was a disaster.Re the metro. the ticket machines only recognise Portuguese credit cards. Cash machine next door.All in all, a lovely 4 days. Thank you Santa Justa!"
Feb 2015,40,great location,Stayed  3 nights in this excellent small modern hotel with  friendly and helpful staff and free wifi.Nice quiet  room (comfort room; 3th floor) with comfy beds and modern bathroom with rainshower.Breakfastbuffet was delicious. We loved the welcome present. (bottle of port en pastel de nata).Great location for everything.Recommend this hotel highly.
Feb 2015,40,Location Plus,"We stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa for four nights in February. This is a small modern hotel, behind the original street facade, in the downtown area. It has everything you would expect in a modern hotel, rooms are compact and well laid out complete with a spacious shower. It's in a great location being on the doorstep of Rossau square, transit hubs, shopping streets and lots of cafes and restaurants. Staff were very helpful and friendly. I would recommend this hotel to my friends."
Feb 2015,50,Excellent hotel in all areas,"I cannot find any fault with my stay at Hotel Santa Justa. Friendly, helpful staff. Great room with very comfortable beds. Excellent shower/bathroom. Great breakfast and wonderful location.I highly recommend it."
Feb 2015,50,Great location!,"Quiet rooms, good bed, nice and helpful staff. Very good bathroom. Close to the office where you buy one-day travellers card for only E 6,50. Walking distance to Alfama or Bairro Alto for the evening."
Feb 2015,30,"Good location, hotel nice.","Great location, v central. Staff were v helpful. Room was nice but small, boutique hotel so expected. Bathroom good size, best shower I've ever had in hotel. Shops on your doorstep. Easy to get to from airport. Two of the main squares close so plenty of places to eat. Would recommend bakery on Rua Augusta, Brasileira, great coffee & pastries, for a third of the price of hotel breakfast. Santa Justa Elevator around the corner, great views of city. Tram & bus stops 5 mins away. A 5 min walk down pedestrian street, Rua Augusta, brings you to Tagus river & great views & lovely walk. Recommend tram 28 get a nice tour of the city.  Nice restaurants in Chiado, not far. The street people recommend for seafood, can't remember name, you are hassled by everyone trying to get you to eat in their restaurant, hard to have a proper look & decide for yourself.

The rooms were spotless and contemporary."

I felt it was all very professional with the  personal touch, they cared! Room had a FREE mini bar with Beer, water and soft drinks. WIFI too was complimentary which is a must nowadays.  I will definitely use this hotel again AB FAB"
Feb 2015,50,Justa very good hotel!,"Friendly staff and a warm welcome including delicious port and custard tarts in the room.  Reception was particularly helpful to a friend of ours even though he was not a guest.  Stylish and comfortable bedroom, pillows sumptuous, and a bathroom to die for!  Great central location - everywhere is walkable.  Also quiet at night as in a pedestrianised area.  We would stay again."
Feb 2015,50,"Great location, excellent service, beautiful room","Perfect base camp to explore the center of Lisbon or catch a tram to visit other neighbourhoods. Although it's located in a very lively street, among shops and restaurants, we were not disturbed by any noise form the street. The rooms are clean and well equipped. Bathroom is quite large and spotless. Great shower too. Service was perfect, both from the household staff and from the reception desk. The hotel also has a nice bar, with a very good selection of local wines.Even the breakfast was good. I can't think of one thing to criticise reallyHighly recommended"
Feb 2015,50,A lovely hotel with excellent personnel,"Our room was small, but very functional. The personnel proved to be extremely service minded. The rooms are modern and well maintained. Its position makes it very easy to use public transportation. To drive in Lisboa needs quite some training, because all one way streets."
Feb 2015,50,An ideal location with fantastic service and sleek modern rooms.,My wife and I spent two nights at the Hotel Santa Justa and could not have had a better experience. The staff was very  courteous and provided excellent dinning recommendations as well as easy to follow directions. The room was great and affordable. We will be staying here again the next time we're in Lisbon.
Feb 2015,50,EXCELLENT HOTEL IN LISBON,"We Stayed Only one night at the Santa Gusta Hotel in Lisbon. Overall, the hotel is very good, nice location, very nice spacious room, large comfortable bed, staff were very nice & friendly. The only problem we had is that we came with a car and it is not possible to access the hotel with a car, the staff were very helpful & helped us carry the luggage back & forth from the parking, but still if you have luggage & you are traveling with a car it is probably not the best option."
Jan 2015,50,Brilliant Hotel,Lovely comfortable hotel in a good location.Hotel staff friendly and helpful following things up efficiently.Free mini bar brilliant addition.Lots of sockets including UK plugs.Very clean and modern.Close to lots of good locations.
Jan 2015,50,Amazing hotel,"I've been in Santa Justa with my family for 4 days ( 2 adts and 2 children). The room  was a suite, very cozy and wide. The point, in my opinion, is the best in Lisbon if you want to feel the spirit of the people: near Baixo Chiado ( you can to many places and the best restaurants on foot). If you go To the hotel with a shuttle service from the airport ( the hotel indicated One that was excelent for 25 euros), they stopped the car with your luggages in front if the hotel (since it's a walker street). After staying here, I traveled to other tows in Portugal and return to Lisbon and stayed at Sofitel Liberdade ( that is an excelent hotel too), but I have to tell that in Santa Justa you can ""feel"" Lisbon better and the room was so good as Sofitel's suite, but the room in Santa Justa was more spacious."
Jan 2015,40,Friendly Staff,The hotel was in a good location.  Walkable to different parts of the city.Good size room and bathroom. UK socket in the room and bathroom.  Free mini bar great.  Breakfast was average. Stay in room 103 - you could hear people on the street and in other rooms.
Jan 2015,50,Fantastic!,"We are a young couple and was very pleasantly surprised by this quaint hotel right in the heart of the city, well located if you're visiting Lisbon as a tourist. The hotel staff were extremely polite and friendly and always provided assistance when needed. The hotel by itself isn't fancy but it's more than just comfortable and is good value for money if you're not looking for something over the top. Didn't eat in the restaurant but ordered room service which was quite good. Overall we enjoyed our stay there and will be recommending the hotel to family and friends :)"
Jan 2015,50,Great hotel,"The staff was very attentive and friendly. The rooms are very comfortable. Nice bathroom with a big shower. It is situated right in the centre of Lisbon. a close walk from the castle, lovely restaurants and shops. Breakfast was delicious, maybe a tad pricey (15 euro). Cannot fault it."
Jan 2015,40,Very Nice,"Nice hotel, quick and very efficient check in, Luis was extremely warm and friendly and gave us a great tip to eat out the Hotel late-night, very helpful staff throughout the hotel, the rooms are stylish, modern and extremely well-equipped, with very comfortable beds, well-appointed bathroom, etc. Great for a weekend break."
Jan 2015,30,"Air conditioning wasn't working, room was damp and small",Welcomed with a bottle of red and some yummy pastries. We stayed in a small room with one double bed. Room was trendy and updated but very small. AC never worked and it was hot at night. We were not able to switch rooms and the staff didn't seem too concerned that it wasn't working. The bed always felt damp which was uncomfortable. Very close to all kinds of restaurants and bars. 5 min walk to the water.
Jan 2015,50,"Central location, peaceful sleep!","We had a loft room, I don't know how much better  it was than other rooms, but It was the most peaceful and comfortable bed ever! I could have stayed asleep for ever! Everything very clean and modern. Reception excellent. A wonderful coffee machine and lovely touches of a gift of port and cakes. My only gripe as an early morning tea drinker would be the ability to make a brew. That aside  a perfect hotel in a wonderful city."
Jan 2015,50,Wonderful,"Where do I begin? My wife and I were welcomed to the Hotel, by Pablo at reception. He was extremely warm and friendly, as if we were coming into his home. I was made to feel like true family by the staff at Hotel Santa Justa. The Portuguese are a very proud people who deeply love their beautiful country and want to share all that it has to offer with there guests. I’m a great lover of seafood and the restaurant they recommended (Cervejaria Ramiro) had hands down, the very best shellfish I have ever eaten EVER! All there recommendations were great. The Fado restaurant was wonderful!The Hotel was in a very good location, very close to all transportation and attractions. Our room, called an “attic” room, was perfect. A very nice size, with beautiful city views. Very clean, with a mini refrigerator stocked with free beverages.I will always lovingly remember Lisbon and it’s wonderful people long into the future!Muito Obrigado"
Jan 2015,50,Excellent Hotel in the city center,Excellent Hotel in the city center . Excellent service . Spacious and quiet rooms . Perfect for exploring the city . Complimentary coffee in the room. Parking. Nice coffe shop and restaurant. City information provided at the reception was helpful.
Jan 2015,50,Great stay in lisboa,"Booked this trip in low season, january. Very impressed with the hotel´s modern decor and ambiance. The complimentary half bottle of port and pastel de nata, as well as chocolates and minibar, were very welcome when arriving from an international trip at 11pm. Loved that they had outlets in the bedroom and bathroom for europe, uk, and us, haven´t seen that before. The lighting was very nice but a little too difficult to figure out how to turn off without orientation (quarter star off for that). Excellent location, very close to Rossi metro. Staff was friendly and spoke very good english. Bar was also nice, didn´t go to the restaurant. Excellent wifi and good selection of tv channels (but you don´t need it). Walls a little thin and some construction noise during the weekday mornings, although I would expect this anywhere in downtown lisboa even on the 5th floor (in america the 6th floor) (another quarter star off). Would definitely stay again if visiting lisboa."
Jan 2015,40,"Great location, excellent value boutique hotel with personal touches","We stayed for 5 nights over New Year. We had an attic room as per our request and it was lovely. The view from the window over the rooftops to the church ruined in the earthquake 100's of years again was stunning both day and night. The streets of local restaurants (plus an Indian restaurant with authentic food in the street behind for those needing a change of cuisine) meant good food and value for money were never far away.  The New Years Eve dinner was excellent - we lost count of the number of courses and the champagne and wine were good quality.  Live music was an unexpected treat.  Biggest hi tech rain shower I have ever seen was great.  Only down sides as others have commented are the sloping roof and wasted space behind the tv area; and lack of an overhead light which meant we fumbled in dark mood lighting a lot....Very close to the main squares where excellent local walking tours begin; and an easy drop off location for the various day tours we took.  Complimentary port in the room, champagne and chocolates for the new year were totally unexpected and a lovely thoughtful touch. Highly recommended."
Jan 2015,50,Excellent in every way,"The Santa Justa is located in the old part of the city and it's location makes it an ideal base for exploring. The hotel is about 150 metres from the metro station and the open top bus stop. It is maybe 100 metres from the stop for the tourist tram and around 10 minutes walk from the river. Many of the attractions are within walking distanceThe hotel itself is both stylish and comfortable and is kept spotlessly clean.We were in room 208 and were very happy with the quality of our accommodation. The bathroom was excellent, the bed was large and comfortable, there was a great TV as well as a coffee maker and we had a small balcony. On our first evening we were given two pastel de nata cakes and a small bottle of port which was a very nice touch.There are dozens of restaurants, cafes and shops within a few minutes walkStaff throughout the hotel did a great job. In particular Joao and Pedro on reception were welcoming, friendly and so very helpful in relation to the many requests for information we had."
Jan 2015,40,centrally located ideal base for a city break,"This is a classic city centre boutique type hotel, ideally located in the very centre of Lisbon. The hotel is modern and stylish, modern and well appointed. Most pleasant  and helpful front desk staff, with good language skills, who were knowledgable and helpful with recommendations about places to visit, restaurant recommendations,and general advice about the city.Rooms are stylish and comfortable, in the modern boutique designer style. Took some time to figure how everything worked, (there was a light in the closet that I never located the off switch for). Very comfortable beds, rooms spotless  cleaning, well sound proofed, and unusually - soft drinks and a couple of beers provided without charge in the mini bar (lovely gesture).They have a nice bar where the staff were friendly and helpful and prices were good, and a restaurant which looked very good but which we did not use - really only because there was so much else around (pick carefully when going out, and get local advice if you can and try to get away from the tourist traps to local favourites)Enjoyed the Hotel, and would be happy to use it again. Thanks for the stayAnd I would really recommend Lisbon for a break."
Jan 2015,50,Lovely hotel with excellent location,"Stayed for four nights in January 2015 and the place was delightful. Very friendly staff, perfectly spotless and comfortable room. The location is really wonderful, just a short walk to so many places to see, eat, shop, etc. Interior is very modern, furniture and decor sleek and somewhat minimalist. We stayed in a suite, which was quite roomy."
Jan 2015,50,Superb Hotel Santa Justa,"Outstanding, modern and very-reasonably-priced hotel (within an older [""Pombaline,"" 18th-century] building) in the center of Lisbon's Rossio (Pedro IV) Square/Baixa historical business district -- close to everything(!). All of the hotel staff -- at every level -- were extremely pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful."
Jan 2015,30,Nothing wrong but not good value,Stayed there 26-28dec. Good hotel but they succumb to greed guided by algorithms. Not worth the ripp off rate of Euro 400 for a standard room. They should learn that the gain made by greed is not worth the long term pain. Pity because at normal rates it is not bad.
Jan 2015,50,"Great location, good value","I stayed in this boutique hotel in the old central district of Lisbon recently and was pleased with the helpful staff and the reasonable value.  The hotel has a great location within walking distance of many restaurants as well as the sights in the central business district, being only four blocks up from Praca Comercio on the river, about six blocks to the west of the Castelo de Sao Jorge, and four blocks south of the tony shopping and window gazing on Avenida de Libertad. Trams and busses make it easy to get around.  There is a convenient cafe/restaurant on the premises.  My room was on the top floor, very quiet, and had a nice marble bath with a rain shower."
Jan 2015,50,Great Respite Hotel in the Heart of it All,"Stayed at the Altis Avenida for three nights earlier in our trip before heading to Porto.  Returned to Lisbon and the Hotel Santa Justa on New Year's Eve.  Excellent location in the heart of Baixa, and close to the New Year's Eve fireworks.  Outstanding service (welcome emails, excellent check-in, complimentary champagne in the room to celebrate the new year, etc.).  Room (second floor corner) was in excellent shape, clean, stylish, and lots of storage. Double paned windows which totally kept out the noise from NY celebrations below.  Great night's sleep in a comfortable bed.  Bathroom was large and had the most wonderful rain shower.  The room really lived well as a home away from home.  We also had the advantage based on room location of 3 Juliet balconies.  Both Lisbon hotels were really quite good, and you couldn't go wrong with either.  The Santa Justa just edged out the Altis based on the room."
Dec 2014,50,Santa Justa lisbon,"Enjoyed our second visit to this fantastic location hotel.the brilliant staff made it for us, nothing was too much trouble very interested in you, they took time to talk and care and made sure our experience was the best, which made it very personal. One observation we would make is that there Is a good mixture of food on offer for breakfast but it is always the same, it has not changed since last time we came in August!"
Dec 2014,50,"Perfect Location, Perfect staff,  Perfect service...","What a wonderful stay our family just experienced in Lisbon.  The location could not be better and the staff across the board was amazing.  Everyone is fluent in English and went out of their way to make our time there so enjoyable.  We are a family of four and the joint family rooms were perfect - one main door that leads to two different rooms with their own doors and bathrooms were ideal!  The beds are super comfortable, furniture is modern, and the showers are amazing.  The breakfast buffet is a great way to start each day and the central location enables you to venture anywhere in the city.  Any needs we had with drivers, day trips, tours, restaurant recommendations, etc were more than met with the staff.  This hotel really made this past Christmas so memorable for all of us.Could not recommend more highly and will definitely be returning back to Santa Justa!"
Dec 2014,40,Great location - modern hotel....,"Enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Santa Justa in Lisbon.  This hotel was in a great location for ease of getting around the city.  Transport was nearby - trams, train and taxi.  With the hotel in a pedestrian only location with shopping and restaurants in easy walking distance, I can certainly recommend staying here.....Only slight ""negative"" was the breakfast - which was extremely expensive for what was provided.  Many better options for breakfast were easily available nearby."
Dec 2014,50,Perfect location for a stay in Lisbon,"I was at a conference by myself in Lisbon and stayed here. It was a very pleasant surprise. The hotel is located right in the centre of the main area for bars and restaurants and close to a main metro station and bus/ tram termini. The rooms were clean and comfortable, the mini-bar was free and on the first night cakes and a half bottle of port was left in the room. Although around the hotel there are plenty of restaurants, better value and quality could be found a little further afield."
Dec 2014,50,Superb accommodations and service in an ideal location,"My wife and I stayed here during our 4-day visit of Lisbon and surrounding areas...loved our accommodations in one of the attic double room with city view...in this case, a view of the Santa Justa Lift and Convento do Cormo...not spectacular but it is a view.We loved the modern décor of the hotel (has only been around for about a year), located in the Baixa district within walking distance to major sights as well as restaurant, shops, and night life. The lively vibe of the neighborhood, especially at night, added some warmth to an otherwise rather chilly weather during our visit. We would sometimes open the window in our room to let the crisp air and the festive sound of street performers in. Our room was spacious, or at least felt spacious possibly due to the smart design making maximum use of space. We also loved the rain shower...especially those lights on the shower that turn from blue to green signifying the desired water temperature has been reached. Kudos as well to the staff for having some pasteis de Belem (pastries) in our room one day and a small bottle of Porto with wine glasses on another...too bad we are near teetotalers  and we didn't drink the wine...now, if it was Sangria, then that is another story. We sampled quite a bit of the sinfully tasty nectar of the Gods (e.g. Sangria) during our visit to Spain and Portugal...oh yeah.We very much enjoyed our stay in Lisbon, due in great part to our accommodations at Hotel Santa Justa. We woke up refreshed, eager to tackle the adventures that await us on a daily basis. A great find!NOTE: We did not avail ourselves of the hotel breakfast (not for 15 Euros)...but there were plenty of cafes nearby that satisfied our need for caffeine and sweets in the morning.The hotel is near various public transportation options, so it was easy to get around."
Dec 2014,40,good location,Good location for walking; modern interior; can dine on the hotel; friendly staff. Less good was the view from the window.Zeker een aanrader voor iemand die een comfortabele hotel in het centrum zoekt.
Dec 2014,40,Excellent Location and Facilities,"The hotel is well located among the walking streets with lots of restaurants and shops, although the restaurants seemed rather touristy. Nevertheless, it made walking around interesting, and was convenient to Alfama (we walked to and from Clube de Fado in Alfama),  and Baixa/Ciado area with many interesting shops and cafes. Room was modern and everything worked. AC/heating controls are unusual, so ask how to operate when shown to your room. Reception was efficient and accommodating. No complaints other than a minor one: the internet rate does not include breakfast, but we decided to pay the 15 euros/person for breakfast as it was a good spread with excellent coffee, and it was cold outside! Cheaper breakfasts were available at the many cafes just around the corner, so really a minor issue."
Dec 2014,50,Excellent hotel for a weekend trip,"I was very pleased with this hotel.  We stayed with out 15-month-old son, who enjoyed it just as much. The staff put a crib in our bedroom and upon arrival (at 11 PM) directed us to an excellent restaurant that stayed open until late.The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was excellent -- traditional fare, such as eggs and bacon, coupled with Portuguese pastry and fruit.  Excellent coffee, which for me is a standard measure of hotel quality.Would certainly stay here again. Keep up the good work!"
Dec 2014,50,The best hotel to visit Lisbon!,"I've lived in Lisbon so I know the city quit well and I can honestly say that if you want to: visit Lisbon, stay in the city center and lots of comfort, hotel Santa Justa is the place to stay! I absolutely loved it! The room has everything you need and more! It is very nicely decorated and the bathroom has a lovely rain shower! The staff is also very friendly! After a long day and tiresome day, we ordered room service and the food was delicious!!!It's a 4 star hotel that definatly deserves 5 stars!"
Dec 2014,50,I'm a former hotel executive...,"Having worked in hotels and traveled extensively for business worldwide, I often see details that others overlook. This hotel has all the details right. You could not pick a better location in the center of Lisbon. Easy walk to most of the sites, restaurants, etc. Given the size limitations of hotels in historic areas, the design of Hotel Santa Justa makes excellent use of space, and it has modern and appealing decor. My room felt large and spacious simply due to the design. Cool blinds to the bathroom help with light and eliminate solid walls. The wireless connection was free with better bandwidth than most luxury hotels. The rates were very reasonable. I did not eat breakfast, but the small cafe in the hotel was nicely appointed. Finally, and most importantly, the staff did an excellent job a range of requests that I made during my stay."
Dec 2014,50,"Great locations, hotel and staff.","Just back from a 3 night stay. The location was perfect for us, within walking distance form all the central attractions and close to metro, bus and tram links. There are lots of restaurants nearby ( good ones and the more tourist trap ones) and lots of shops to wander around.  The hotel has a modern decor and is kept immaculately clean.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff couldn't have been nicer.  We didn't eat in the hotel but we did have drinks at the bar.  Our room was on the third floor and faced on to the street, unlike a recent review, we did not experience smells or noise from the nearby restaurants.  Sleep quality was great.  The room has everything you need including an ironing board and hairdryer and the toiletries, free minibar and coffee capsules were topped up each day.We used the airport bus to get to the hotel but chose to use the metro to get back to the airport.  The metro is quicker and starts earlier in the morning than the buses but both were within easy walking distance from the hotel ( Rossio square).Always be vigilant of people around you for pick pockets and be aware that you will likely be offered drugs on the streets, a simple ""no"" is fine, we were never hassled.Our favourite places to eat/drink:ginghina do carmo - bar on Caldada do Carmo just behind Rossio Square.Da Prata 52 - tapas restaurant on Rua Da Prata, the best meal we had in Lisbon.O Purista - Barbière on Rua Nova De Trindade a bar and barber shop all in one, sounds odd but it works.We plan to return to Lisbon and we will definitely come back to the Hotel Santa Justa."
Dec 2014,50,Wonderful hotel which should be given 5 stars,"Great location in the heart of city centre. Hotel staffs are friendly, helpful and gives good guide and recommendation to food and sight seeing. Room and bathroom are spacious. There is free mini bar which is refilled everyday with good selection of drinks. That's awesome! There is welcome Portuguese tart and port wine. Did not try the breakfast. On the whole is an enjoyable stay. I will definitely stay in Hotel Justa Santa again for my next trip."
Dec 2014,50,Very nice hotel in an strategic place,"This is a boutique style hotel, very confortable, in a pedestrian street in the middle of everything in Lisbon. You have at short distance the Santa Justa elevator, the Rossio square and Comercio square. The service is good. Take into account you cannot reach the door of the hotel by car. You have to park at the nearby Praça da Figueira. The price is quite good compared with similar hotels nearby of the same quality."
Dec 2014,50,A Gem in the Old Town,"This modern hotel in the historic and downtown part of Lisbon is around 5 blocks from the water, near shopping and public squares and fountains. The streets were decorated for Christmas with many lights. It contains many excellent restaurants."
Dec 2014,50,Wonderful hotel at perfect loacation,"By the city center, renovated rooms. Restaurants and shops are steps away. Very helpful and polite staff. Although at the center, no noise from the street when you close the window. Rooms are trendy and complimentary espresso machine and free minibar... what can I say more!"
Dec 2014,50,Pretty damn good,"Staying here for 2 nights with friends, nice big rooms in lovely old building, right in the centre of town , everything is within walking distance, super clean & very helpful staff. Breakfast superb with lots of choices, make this your Lisbon  hideaway."
Dec 2014,50,Small but perfectly formed!,"This is a 4-star hotel in a perfect location for all the sights and shops. This was our first visit to Lisbon and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. We were unfortunate to have got pick-pocketed and my partner's wallet was stolen.  The staff were so good they actually walked and showed us the way to the police station.  Do beware when travelling on the No. 28 Tram!!Our room was a superior room on the 2nd floor and had a fantastic shower.  Didn't have a jacuzzi bath but we didn't mind.  The breakfast, as others have said, was really great - lots of choice and lovely fresh orange juice.Very nice touch to have a welcome mini bottle of port and our first taste of custard tarts.  First time we've had a complimentary mini bar too.Can't recommend this hotel highly enough.  Definitely go back if we visit Lisbon again."
Dec 2014,40,Very good but far from perfect,Excellent location. Cleanliness was also excellent. On the downside:Rooms are too small. Smell of food and noise from the restaurants under hotel are an annoiance.Lack of water and hot coffee free to guests at the long is unforgivable. No place for guests to tay on rainy days as all space available at ground level is used up by the hotel restaurant.Restaurante servers at neighboring restaurants are noise and harass guests.Housekeeping is random sometimes too late in the day.João and Ricard at the front desk are very nice.
Dec 2014,40,Charming Lisbon Stay,"Hotel was just as pictured and exceed expectations.  Interior was modern in both public areas and rooms.  Superior room was large with wood floors, lighting, Jacuzzi tub and French door to small balcony overlooking pedestrian streets.  Quiet windows.  Mini bar complimentary, mini nespresso maker and welcome mini bottle of port and custard tarts.  Bar restaurant staff was great.  Breakfast was good with both euro and UK/US items, fruit, nespresso, etc....and more of these famous Portuguese pasteis de nata custard tarts."
Dec 2014,40,Nice hotel.,"This hotel is in a great location, in the center of everything.  The rooms are nice and new. The people are pleasant and helpful.But there is some minor tweaks that they could do to make it better...1. TV volume limit is too low. If someone is in the shower or if the window is open the only way to hear it is to stand right in front of the TV.  I think who ever set the vol limit did it without lying in the bed.2. No free tea or coffee. You get two nesspreso cups at check-in, but thats it for your entire stay. You can purchase more for €2 each. I think it would be better to just put in an electric kettle with tea bags and instant coffee. Cheaper machine yet more flexible for your guest to have a drink with the pastries that were brought back to the room.3. Nice to have a free minibar, but too many items for your staff to manage.  4 bottles of water would be easier to manage rather than juice, soda, tonic water, sparkling water, beer, juice drink, etc.  Maybe diet soda? You already get too much sugar in Lisbon with a pastry cafe on every corner and the last thing I wanted in my room was sugary drinks.  4. Always have a backup supply of shampoo/bath gel.  They only replaced it after it was really low or empty.  When my wife with her thick hair shampoos whatever is left in the bottle is gone and I dont have a backup supply to go to. I guess you can use the bath gel?"
Nov 2014,50,Pleasant stay great hotel and lovely staff,"I would recommend this hotel 100%. Great rooms, food, beds, and helpful and friendly staff. Nothing bad to say.  Very central and the breakfast was very good. I would stay there again. We stayed in a superior room and it was that, robes etc and jacuzzi bath!"
Nov 2014,50,Good experience,"Nice hotel, quick and very efficient check in. Room was spacious, modern furniture, king size bed and nice bathroom with jacuzzi style bath. Everywhere was very clean, nice choice at breakfast that suited most tastes. Great position in close proximity to transport links and shopping on the doorstep. Very helpful staff throughout the hotel. Very good value for money. We would recommend this hotel."
Nov 2014,50,Very sweet boutique 4-star hotel in interesting downtown Lisbon location,"This is a boutique 4-star hotel in an interesting location in downtown Lisbon. Very nice and helpful staff. One of the best showers I’ve ever had in a hotel room, it even includes a color light show! My only negative: Don’t go for one of the attic rooms, billed as having a roofline view. These rooms are cramped, with windows that don’t really open. You are much better off with a room on the fourth or fifth floors."
Nov 2014,50,Great Lisbon location,"Modern sleek hotel. Rooms are small but so well done that they feel larger. Staff is very helpful, made arrangements and suggestions without being asked. Great location in the center of the city. Would stay here again."
Nov 2014,50,Quick trip to Lisbon,Excellent hotel and great location. Very friendly staff.  We had a JR suite that was quitespacious.  Breakfast was delicious! Everyone spoke English.  It was very convenient tothe main tour bus stops! Highly recommend
Nov 2014,40,Great hotel,"Great central location near Rossio.  Room was nice but a little dark.  It may be that rooms on higher floors are lighter.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Breakfast is nice quality, fresh orange juice was delicious. I would definitely recommend staying here."
Nov 2014,50,Great location to discover old Lisbon,"This was our first visit to Lisbon and we wanted to stay in the heart of the city. Santa Justa Hotel is on a great location in Baixa, lovely streets which are closed to traffic. Staff, service, breakfast, meals, cleaning, everything was great, they let us in our room before check in time. Just love our stay, nothing to complain."
Nov 2014,40,Very nice!,"Hotel is very nice, stuff very polite and plesant. Breakfast in very good, all you can wish. The lady serving it is very nice. And fresh orange juice... We love everything. Location is the best. Little minus is clean room-dust was everywhere and everything we moved was dusty!"
Nov 2014,50,Perfect for a family,We were traveling with our 2 teenage sons.  We had connecting rooms which were perfect.  The breakfast was great as was the service from all the employees we encountered.  Everyone spoke English.  We walked everywhere.  Easy walk to bus stop and train station.
Nov 2014,50,excellent location and service,just one minute from Rossio where airport bus and main trams and meteo stop. very safe area. no complanining other than low ceiling 6th floor. i hit my head several times.Staffs are kind and helpful. Free espress at room.Very clean room.
Nov 2014,50,Perfect location and comfort ,Very happy with this hotel. Room is snug but nicely designed for comfort and style. Staff couldn't be more helpful. Great location in a busy restaurant filled street and near to the main squares with good cafés but quiet at night. Great for a weekend break.
Nov 2014,50,Nice!,"Perfectly situated hotel - less than two blocks from Rossio and about 7-8 minutes from Praca de Comercio, and other sights worth seeing within walking distance as well. You won't go hungry either as there are restaurants all around.The hotel staff was warm and friendly throughout - at the front desk as well as at the restaurant. The room was modern, of a good size, and well designed. One of the biggest hotel bathrooms I have seen anywhere. Definitely two thumbs up. I would stay here again."
Nov 2014,50,"Lovely Hotel, great location","Very nice hotel and the location in central Lisbon, just a few minutes walk from the waterfront and other sights cannot be faulted. Room was a perfect size, staff helpful and spoke good English. There are lots of great places to eat nearby, just look at reviews."
Nov 2014,50,Great hotel,"Although it looks as old as all the other building around it, this is a beautiful, state of the art, boutique hotel located on the pedestrian walk way in the old area. Beds are incredibly comfortable, restaurant is good, staff is great."
Nov 2014,50,Perfect,This is a great property. The location is right where you want to be. Walk to everything right from the front door. The staff couldn't be more helpful. Good breakfast in cute courtyard.  Would definitely recommend
Nov 2014,50,A very pleasant surprise,"I had to change my travel plans last minute due to an unfortunate medical issue. To make my re-scheduled flight, I had to stay in Lisbon another night. I had stayed 4 nights at the Hotel Avenida Palace but they were fully booked for the extra night. The Hotel Santa Justa is just a few blocks away and I was able to book with them the same day. The location, service, and room were all excellent, and the bottle of tawny port along with the pasteis de nata were a wonderful surprise. The next time I'm in Lisbon this will be my hotel of choice."
Nov 2014,50,Excellent hotel in the centre of a wonderful city,"From our first step through the door we felt at home with a big smiling welcome from the receptionists. During our 3 night stay, we found all the staff to be exceptional, the rooms to a very high standard, and the food very good. Would certainly return and recommend to anyone."
Nov 2014,40,"good hotel, great location, friendly staff","stayed in this hotel for three nights. fantastic location in the center of town within walking distance of all highlights of Lisboa. quiet rooms, comfortable bed, good breakfast. very friendly staff. strongly recommended!!"
Nov 2014,50,Such a Nice Place to Stay,"We stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa during October, 2014, for 2 nights.   What a wonderful experience.   Located in the heart of Lisbon with easy access to public transportation, it is a modern and well appointed hotel.   Our room had AC,  2 very comfortable twin beds put next to each other in the European style, an upholstered headboard, a marble bath with a terrific shower, a safe, and all the amenities.  We even received complimentary port wine in our room on the first night of our stay.  There was a coffee machine with a couple of complimentary coffees, but, if you want more, there is a charge for them.   Wifi in the room was included in the price.  The breakfast is extensive, fast,  tasty, and convenient, but pricey.  There are numerous less expensive restaurants and bakeries in the area where breakfast is served so you do have a choice.   The hotel is very clean, and the staff is friendly and helpful.   They will make dinner reservations, provide maps and make  tour bookings,  offer big umbrellas if the weather is uncooperative, and make you feel both welcomed and appreciated for staying at this hotel.   We highly recommend it."
Nov 2014,50,Very Nice Hotel,This is a very nice hotel. Clean rooms and bathroom. Room are comfortable with a  nice bed and a nice bathroom. Location is also very nice. Food in the restaurant is quite good. Staff is very friendly and helpful.
Nov 2014,50,Perfect hotel in the centre of Lisbon,"Outstanding location on a quiet, pedestrianised street in the very centre of town with short walks to all the main sights (and just 2 minutes from the nearest metro station). The hotel is immaculate - it's less than a year old, and the rooms are stylish, modern and extremely well-equipped, with very comfortable beds, well-appointed bathroom, etc. The free bottle of port and ""pasteis de nata"" was also a nice touch. The staff were also great - friendly, smiling and helpful. The breakfast buffet was good value (15 EUR) with a nice selection of hot (scrambled eggs, bacon) and cold (pastries, fruit) food. Honestly, I can't think of a bad thing to say about the place. If you're looking for a great hotel in central Lisbon, this is the place.Next time I'm in Lisbon, I will definitely stay at the Hotel Santa Justa."
Nov 2014,40,Great Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for three nights with my mom.  It was the perfect hotel for us! Location was amazing and central. The staff was really helpful and made some great dinner recommendations and day trip suggestions.  The room was really clean and quiet even though the hotel is on a busy street.  Overall, the energy and atmosphere was just what we wanted.  I would suggest this hotel to any of my friends and family."
Oct 2014,50,The Heart of the City,"I recently stayed at this hotel and found it to be in the heart of the city.  You walk out the front door and your 5 minutes from the water 3 minutes to the train station and walking distance to many dining spots.  The cost was a little high, but it was a last minute decision to stay there.  Very clean and modern.  If you stayed in the heart of the city before, you know alot of places are older.  This place is alive."
Oct 2014,40,Service beyond expectation.,We are grateful to have found this boutique hotel in a fabulous location. Most of all was the outstanding service and genuine interest in guests. Thank you for a marvelous visit. We would be happy to chose Santa Justa for another visit.
Oct 2014,40,Very nice 2 night family stay,Very helpful staff they had a room ready for early check in. Nice perk getting 2 pastis de nata and some port on the first night. The family room was 2 rooms with a small interconnecting corridor so overall very good value considering it was actually 2 discreet rooms. Modern classy decor and good location in terms of the in the middle of the tourist centre
Oct 2014,50,"Stop searching, this is it","Just came back from a 4 nights stay at this hotel. Overall very clean, safe, decent size room with great and helpful staff.  We had room 301 and room was quiet and no noise heard from the pedestrian mall and restaurant below. Rooms on the 3rd floors did not have a view except those of a old building opposite. Rooms had international power sockets attached in toilets, TV and in the safe - great idea. Overall would prefer a brighter deco in room and brighter corridor. With a greying population, more people would prefer and need brighter rooms. Hopefully, management would consider when they start plans for their next hotel project across the street/block.Taxi fare from airport to this hotel is about 15-20 euros and bus shuttle is less than 4 euros and stops near the hotel (600m walk). The only issue is that if you driving (which we did), the street in front of the hotel is closed to traffic after 10am and makes it difficult to drop off luggages. We arrived after 12pm and had to drag our luggage over the cobblestone pavement thru town to the hotel after returning the rental car. This part of town location (Baixa/Chiado) is the best as its close to most of the shopping and tourists spots. If you considering hotels along Liberdade, just note that it's less vibrant and can be a long walk each day. The only decent hotel along that stretch is Sofitel (nearest) and four seasons and Intercontinental is too far from the action. Rue Garett would be a recommended focal point.The problem of the restaurants waiters haggling asking you for meals is a common sight and menace throughout Portugal, something you have to live thru if you need to walk thru the pedestrian mall. Alternatively, you can choose to walk on a quiet alley and maybe faced a few drunks along the way.We had a tuna sandwich at the hotel restaurant, for 12 euros ( high compared to most other places 8 euros) you literally get a tuna and bread. That's it. I would have thought the hotel would added some lettuce, tomatoes, onions onto the sandwich. Bottom line, the tuna steak sandwich was plain and boring. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, within a few hundred meters besides the lift, there is a Eric Kayser (French pastry shop) where you can have a sandwich for 3.95 euros and 0.70 espresso from 8am or a complete breakfast for 6 euros. I would definitely stay here again when I am in town."
Oct 2014,40,Great Location,"Location was ideal-in the heart of the city but in the pedestrianised area so no traffic or noise and 5 mins walk from metro station,No 28 tram route and Railway Station for trains to Sintra.The rooms are modern, a reasonable size for a city-centre hotel, clean and comfortable, with effective air conditioning. The ""girls"" were very impressed with the range of toiletries in the bathroom-shower was excellent although it took a while to work out the controls.Breakfast had an excellent selection including  fresh local pastries each day. Staff were very helpful when we arrived mid evening because of a delayed flight and recommended a restaurant and booked a table for us in what turned out to be the best meal of our stay,they were happy to provide directions and when the iron appeared a little temperemental, they replaced it immediately."
Oct 2014,50,traveler,"This was a great place to stay, located near many great restaurants, shopping and sights.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. It was also close to the Metro, Trams, and train. The Port wine and pastry on arrival was a very nice surprise.  The breakfast each morning was very good with fresh fruit, eggs and pastries."
Oct 2014,50,Perfect!,"Our stay at the Hotel Santa Justa was perfect in every way. The hotel is in a wonderful area of the city: immaculate, modern and very comfortable. The staff were wonderful. My friend accidentally left her fine jewelry in the safe upon check out, and the staff were very helpful in making arrangements and having it shipped to our hotel in Rome. Lisbon is a charming city. Everyone we met there was so friendly and helpful. Wonderful sites to see and great food and wine!"
Oct 2014,50,Odd-shaped rooms,"Overall, a great place to stay right in the heart of where you want to be in Lisbon. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the hotel is very new, but my only criticism is about it's design - the room we stayed in (one of the biggest ones) was a very odd shape - very wide but very shallow, meaning the bed was jammed in to the uncomfortable end of an L-shape. This room could definitely have been much better planned, and the breakfast area is just too small for the number of guests using it. Presumably for security reasons, the pavement seating area is not used for the self-service breakfast buffet which is a shame, as this would solve the problem. During the day, the pavement cafe is a very pleasant place to sit and the food here is good - you can sit back and smugly watch undiscerning tourists being snared by the restaurant hustlers next door. So aside from criticising the architect, this hotel is a great success."
Oct 2014,40,perfect location and excellent hotel,We received a very warm welcome and the staff were always attentive and helpful. The location is perfect ; you just walk out of the Hotel and you're in the middle of the City with most of the sites on the doorstep. The rooms were sufficient for a City trip but not much cupboard space. However they were kept very clean and the bathroom was large and spacious. I would choose this Hotel should I visit Lisbon again and strongly recommend it to others!
Oct 2014,50,"Top notch place, great location and service","From the minute we arrived the staff was attentive and very helpful and speak fantastic english. They pulled out the map of lisbon to show the sites and how to get there as well as answer all questions.The rooms were clean and had a safe and refrigerator. The staff left a small bottle of port wine and sweet treat on the first night. there is also a restaurant in the hotel which was always full, we ate there and the food and service was also great. The hotel is located in the center of the action, great shops, restaurants, historical sites,  and entertainment close by, as well as metro stops and the train station. I recommend staying at the Hotel Santa Justa."
Oct 2014,40,Great location,Loved the hotel for its location plus close to Rossio metro station.  Close to good restaurants and in the middle of all the sites plus near the castle area and Alfama.  Easy to catch the trams too. Nice modern room with fab shower.
Oct 2014,50,Great Location for city exploring,We did not get the room we had booked (Attic Room) due to a technical problem however the manger upgraded us to a superior room which had balcony views of the streets of Lisbon. After seeing the standard double room and superior double you need to pay a little extra for the relaxed comfort and space of the superior room with its full length Jacuzzi bath. The staff in the hotel are extremely friendly and helpful on the typical tourist requests. Can't fault it and would stay again at the Santa Justa. Don't waist your money on a taxi from the airport the metro station is only 100m from the hotel and cost my wife and I €4 compared to the €25 charged by the taxi - more money saved for the bars!!
Oct 2014,50,Great location for city break,"Recently stayed here for 6 nights on our first trip to Lisbon. Short trip from the airport, we booked a car which took about 20mins. The hotel is centrally located on a street full of restaurants and between two main shopping streets, a 5min walk to the main square. Quick and easy check in from friendly staff. Room was on the 4th floor above the street but as per all the other reviews you couldn't hear anything once the balcony door was closed so no problem sleeping at night. Had a small bottle of port in the room and two local pastries (pastel de nata) and there was a free mini bar. Staff were always friendly and helpful, recommended a few restaurants for us and also made table bookings. Ate at the hotel restaurant twice (separate review done) and the food was excellent. Hotel was ideally located in the centre of Lisbon to get around easily, couldn't fault it to be honest and would definitely recommend or return."
Oct 2014,50,Great stay in Lisbon.,"As it was our first time in Lisbon my wife an I wanted to stay in a more centrally located hotel than we usually do. The Santa Justa hotel is THE perfect location as you are right in the heart of the action. Staff were probably the friendliest we have ever encountered in a hotel anywhere, always pleasant and eager to please. Our room was 402 and it was plenty big for a couple of days stay.  Samsung flatsceen tv, free soft drinks minibar,Nespresso coffee maker in room were great as was the whirlpool bath and rain shower. All in all a perfect stay and the next time we are in Lisbon we will definitely be back at the Santa Justa hotel."
Oct 2014,50,A perfect hotel in Lisboa,"Our room, #410, had a balcony with a view of the castle It was a lovely a comfortable room. The bathroom is full of amenities along with a unique and terrific shower,The staff at this hotel, Marianne, Joao, Pedro and Sandrina, were all delightful and very helpful.  They seems engaged in our conversations and treated us more like personal friends rather than just responding with memorized answers that they have said hundreds of times. Their restaurant suggestions were good and their all around assistance made this a memorable stay for us.  We would definitely return to this hotel."
Oct 2014,50,A very nice hotel in an excellent position,Santa Justa is a very nice and well-managed hotel positioned in the very heart of Lisbon. The staff is professional and helpful. The property is well kept and the interiors are tasteful in modern design.
Oct 2014,40,Warm and inviting,"We arrived at the Hotel Santa Justa to find a room all ready for us, even though it was well before check-in time. The room was clean, spare, but had every amenity we could want, including a safe and a small Nespresso machine.  After a rest, we were greeted at the door by room service bringing us a complimentary small bottle of port and two lovely custard tarts -- what a gracious welcome!  We were happy that we included the buffet breakfast, which included hot and cold dishes and the best orange juice we had ever had -- and we are from California.  Great start to our vacation."
Oct 2014,50,Fabulous boutique hotel in the centre of Lisbon,"The location of the hotel is perfect as it is a short walk from so many of the fabulous squares and sights of the city.  The best part of the hotel is definitely the staff - every one of them was friendly, helpful and professional.  The food in the restaurant was also excellent and inexpensive.  All round, it is a choice I would recommend to anyone looking for a city break in Lisbon."
Oct 2014,50,Great location - good restaurant - good room,"Stayed 4 nights, travelled as a couple.The staff were always very helpful and friendly with any questions we had. Our room was modern, clean and comfortable. Location of hotel was great - we could walk to most places and if not, the metro station Rossio was very close by - 2 mins away. It is located on a pedestrianised street off the main square.We ate in the restaurant for dinner one night and this was very reasonably priced and portion sizes were generous. Breakfast was good, but lacked variation over the duration of our stay.Overall we were very happy with our stay here and would stay again!"
Oct 2014,40,Nearby historical centre,"The hotel started its operation in 2013, then everything is new and working properly. It is located in a pedestrian street, very quiet at night but the desadvantage is that you have to carry your luggage from the taxi up to the hotel. The food of the restaurant is poor. We ordered codfish ""Gomes de Sá"" and it was more like an omelete with taste of codfish than a real codfish ."
Oct 2014,50,Wonderful stay,"Great modern hotel, cool room (we had a suite on the 3rd floor) that was quiet even while facing the street.  Awesome location and wonderful staff who were helpful with all that was asked of them.  Nice details here."
Oct 2014,40,Good location and friendly staff,Good location for walking to tourist attractions and close to MetroFriendly staffNice room although  vacuuming could be more thorough and a small amount of mould around shower .Wifi and TV goodWould be happy to stay there again.
Oct 2014,50,Beautiful boutique hotel,"Hotel is very modern, with excellent attentive staff.  Brealfast was great, included with our room.  Room had views in two directions, upper floor corner room.  Location was excellent. Quiet, bathroom was very modern, with great shower."
Oct 2014,50,"Excellent location, friendly staff","The hotel is in a terrific location for exploring Lisbon, 2 minutes from the Rossio metro station. Check in staff were very friendly and helpful. Our family room turned out to be two rooms with a connecting lobby - excellent as we had loads of space. Rooms were modern and well equipped… and when we came back from our first day's sightseeing there was a lovely gift in each room which we promptly ate and drank. No road noise either.  I would definitely go back."
Oct 2014,50,"Excellent hotel, centrally located","We stayed for 4 nights at this hotel in September. We reserved a comfort room on floor 5. The room was good, perhaps a little dark due to the colour scheme. The room was well maintained and always cleaned fully. The staff throughout the hotel are polite and genuinely helpful. We had a bed and breakfast package and the buffet breakfast was good with a wide range of choice. The restaurant area is a little small and can get congested when busy. We dined there in the evening and the food was reasonable and competitively priced. This is certainly a hotel that deserves its high rating in trip advisor."
Oct 2014,50,All good. Just(a) all good ;-),"LOVELY hotel. Located in ""centro"" - old town Lisbon. Hotel is very modern, well appointed, with excellent bathrooms. Breakfast is buffett style in the morning, with both hot and cold. Wonderful pastries (local specialities) were included - try them ! One of the best things about Hotel Santa Just a is the location. Easy walks to lots of places and things in centro. Staff was very fleet in English, very helpful. This was my first night in Portugal, so the room being so very nice was super appreciated."
Sep 2014,50,"Very nice hotel, Comfort Room quite small","Everything fine, great location, good bed, good breakfast, nice and very attentive staff. A bit narrow, which is partly due to the nature of the building in itself. Negative: the fact that there was almost no space in the room to leave the suitcase; a bit strange: the sliding door for closing either wardrobe or bathroom. Bathroom, however, not too narrow, with a rainfall shower. Would return."
Sep 2014,50,Excellent hotel,"Fantastic hotel! Great showers (rainfall showers). Outstanding location and a knowledgable staff that went out of their way to get us fantastic reservations. The breakfast was out of this world - much better than the usual continental fare - with eggs, toast, pastry and delicious fresh fruit. Woul go bak and stay there again in a heartbeat."
Sep 2014,40,Nespresso only for 1 day,"Great location, staff very helpfull, quiet, l stayed at the attic room 604One minor:We spend 4 nights, so also payed for 4 days, so why not every morning new 2 pieces of nespresso cups, it's is a principal issue!.This hotel should  listen to the customers, many reviewers mentioned this.But I certainly recommend this hotel."
Sep 2014,30,Nice hotel,"The best thing about this hotel is the location - right in the Rossio district. Just a few blocks from the Tagus river, many restaurants and shopping. My room was on the 6th floor. The room didn't have a bathtub or regular shower - I had to hold the shower head to bathe - which is not what I am accustomed to doing especially for $200 US a night. Also, the way the room is situated, I kept bumping my head on the ceiling as it comes down (like an attic) where they've place a bean bag chair and the flat screen tv is there for you to watch. It's a nice hotel with very nice staff but I probably wouldn't stay there again."
Sep 2014,50,Amazing,"We really really enjoyed this hotel.  The room was outstanding.  The staff were very helpful and professional.  The hotel is also beautifully located.  Very close to amazing restaurants, stores and taxis."
Sep 2014,50,The place to stay lisbon,"Centrally located, comfortable rooms & great staff. Breakfast gives you a good choice. It is a small just in the pedestrianised part between Rossio & Place commercial.15 mins walk to Castello St Jorge or 5 mins to main Fado area, can it get any better"
Sep 2014,50,A gorgeous little gem of a place to stay!,"Our stay began with the two most delightful hotel staff I've ever had the pleasure to deal with and it got better from there.  This place has so much to recommend it but top of the list are, by far, staff and location.The hotel sits on a pedestrianised street, in one of the few flat bits of central Lisbon, in a location which makes it a doddle to get everywhere in the city either by foot or by public transport, though if you have mobility issues, allow more time than stated for the places you need to walk upwards to get to.  Whether you want to shop, eat, sight-see or go out to play at night, this hotel is in a perfect place.  It's spot on for the open-topped buses and Tram 28.As regards the hotel itself, it's modern and stylish.  Our rooms (on the second floor) were on the small side, I'd say, for a 4*, but clean and comfortable with a well-stocked mini bar and a coffee-making machine.  There was also fun to be had with the bathroom blinds if you can find the right switch!!!  There is a good range of things to eat for breakfast, comfortable indoor and outdoor space if you want to enjoy the delights of the bar and if you can't be bothered to go restaurant-hunting, there's yummy fare available on site.I can't fault the staff in any way, whether they worked on reception, in the restaurant or cleaned our rooms:  affable, engaging and bend-over-backwards accommodating.  As well as welcoming treats in our rooms, we got some super recommendations for eateries and getting out and about in the city and the receptionists were more than happy to make bookings on our behalf.We had a fantastic 4 days in Lisbon, which itself is a super city, thanks, in many ways, to the Hotel Santa Justa.  What a joy it is to recommend it and if your stay is even only half as good as ours was, you'll have a marvellous time!  Enjoy!!!"
Sep 2014,50,Perfect stay!,"Highly recommended! Excellent hotel, located in the heart of Lisbon. Perfect starting point to discover Lisbon. Nice and clean rooms, top standard, supportive etc. Next time in Lisbon I will stay definitely again in Junta"
Sep 2014,40,Wonderful hotel in a superb location,"There are a few hotels that we have been so completely satisfied with and this is one of the less than 5 in all our travels throughout Europe.Arriving after a pleasant ride on the Aerobus, the hotel was simply a corner away from the main city square, along a busy pedestrian lane. So it was not a problem even if you had luggage in tow, so don't bother with an expensive taxi.We were greeted by a well appointed and smart-looking hotel with warm staff. Check-in was prompt and we were shown to our rooms which were very modern and comfortable. Excellent modern amenities, fast wifi, strong water pressure and free goodies in the fridge! And the double-glazing was superb giving us a good night's rest after exploring the city.With so many good eateries within walking distance and the weather nicely suited to walking, we did not bother with breakfast or any meals in the hotel.A great choice and we would definitely stay here when we come back."
Sep 2014,40,Fresh and Pleasant Hotel,"We had a 4 night stay here in August 2014. Hotel easily found exiting the Metro (Rossio). Check in was quick and very efficient. We arrived at 1130am and room was ready for us.Good friendly helpful staff, a welcome drink was brought to our room and free minibar. Ate here first night and received a discount.On a pedestrian street, noise from restaurants/street entertainers in evening but good soundproofing in room. Breakfast buffet could be busy after 9 am but quiet earlier so no great problem. Location good, Metro 200M and close to restaurants, squares, attractions & viewpoints (Santa Justa Elevator, Castelo de Sao Jorge, River Targus) Many tourist trap restaurants close to the hotel but we found some good local ones with excellent reviews in quieter streets a short distance away.Enjoyable stay."
Sep 2014,50,Fantastic,"My friend and I have just returned from a weekend at this fabulous hotel. The staff were so helpful and accommodating, they allowed us to check in two hours early and we were upgraded to a larger room on the top floor. The hotel room had a free minibar which was replenished daily, we came back to our room to find a bottle of port and some Portuguese pastries on the first night too. A lovely touch. The hotel is located right in the centre of the shops and restaurants but as previously mentioned on here there is no issue with noise. Lisbon is very hilly but we still managed to see most of it on foot. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. Would love to go back soon."
Sep 2014,40,Pleasently surprised,"* Amazing location - you are right in the heart of the city.  Although Lisbon is not a flat city, you can still walk to many locations from the hotel.  We walked to Igreja do Carmo (7 minutes), Santo Antonio do Lisboa (10-12 min), Arco Triunfal da Rua Agusta (3 min)... many restaurant options and much more.   * Rooms - the rooms were clean and modern.  Good bathrooms.  They are better in real life than what you can see in the pictures taken by others and shared here.  * Quiet - they rooms were surprisingly quiet.  You are in the middle of downtown and we had no issues with noise.  The windows have been upgraded and they do an excellent job of keeping the noise out of your room.*Staff - Very friendly and very helpful staff.  * Breakfast  - This was the only area where they can improve.  It's very basic and everything seems store bought ready as opposed to freshly made.  (This is the only reason they I didn't give this hotel 5 stars).   Maybe don't include your breakfast on your room rate and eat outside.  There several good options to grab something and go or sit down and eat that are way better than what the hotel has to offer.  *Families - the hotel offers interconnecting rooms."
Sep 2014,40,Fab location lovely hotel and service,"Only thing missing for me was tea making facilities in bedroom, did have coffee and free bar in room so was excellent in all other respects. We were in attic so room little smaller than liked but ample and the views nade up for this . Location perfect for everything.  Would recommend for city break, we stayed 5 happy nights and  it was very quiet inside which made from good sleep."
Sep 2014,50,We loved this hotel!,"This was our first stop in Portugal and the Santa Justa was perfect in every way. Great location, wonderful room (a suite- plenty of room), helpful and kind staff. It was actually the quietest room I've ever stayed in! (I wasn't thrilled initially to see it was the first next to the elevator but you could never hear a sound). If we ever return to Lisbon we would definitely stay at the Santa Justa."
Sep 2014,50,Excellent hotel,"We had a quick 2 night stay, having travelled up from the Algarve, the staff were very helpful and friendly giving us directions to the hotel and meeting us at the car park which was close by. The parking was pre booked with them as we didn't want to waste valuable time driving around in a city we didn't know, although a little expensive it's what you expect in cities in prime location. The welcome port and pastries were a nice touch and the hotel was beautifully modern and clean. A thoroughly enjoyable stay"
Sep 2014,50,Superb hotel and location,"Couldn't have stayed in a better hotel for our 5 day trip to Lisbon. The hotel is in a great location with everything you need or want to see just a walk away. Despite being situated on a busy pedestrianised street, excellent double glazing means noise does not penetrate into the bedrooms. Rooms are well appointed, breakfast great and staff very pleasant and helpful. The  welcome gift of port was a nice touch and much appreciated. We would highly recommend this hotel."
Sep 2014,50,Central location,"You can't get much better on location than the Santa Justa. We walked from here to just about every part of the city, down to the waterfront is a few minutes, up to the castle (via the new elevator system) was 20 minutes, via the Santa Just lift to the Carmo ruins.The staff was friendly, the rooms were small, but very functional. And the price was excellent."
Sep 2014,50,"Excellent, in the very heart of the city.","Very friendly staff, clean, nice room, immediate access to restaurants, cafe places and tourist attractions. Close to airport shuttle. Free welcome port and coffee, good shopping all around, close to all entertainment."
Sep 2014,50,Excellent hotel,Santa justa is in a perfect location close to all amenities and attractions the staff were all very friendly and helpful the rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean and adequate for a city break food at the hotel was delicious with every member of the staff taking care off all visitors would most definately recommend and would not hesitate to return excellent
Sep 2014,40,Very nice; convenient location,"Hotel Santa Justa is conveniently located near Praca da Figueira. It's a quick walk to Praca do Rossio or Praca do Comercio. The only thing ruining the location are the waiters at the restaurants lining the street the hotel is on. They are very annoying and aggressive, much more so than other similar tourist areas in Athens or Istanbul. The hotel is modern, the rooms are a decent size and the bathrooms are very nice. Towels and bedding are nice. Personally I don't like rainshower showerheads or the heavy comforters in warm weather, but other might like them. There is a mini-fridge with plenty of room for you own drinks, although it doesn't get that cold. There are 2 American electrical outlets, which is very convenient. The a/c is very good and the rooms are soundproof to street noise, although we did hear quite a bit of noise from within the hotel the first morning -- like furniture moving above and around us. A few words about the ""expensive"" breakfast: worth it! It's not easy to get breakfast in this area. There is a cute pastry shop down the street with good coffee, but it's very hard to get waited on. There is a Starbucks at the Rossio train station and another one fairly nearby in Chiado. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is the fastest meal you will have in Lisbon, the choices are good -- something to suit every taste -- from cereal to eggs to fruit. Just pay for it. We had drinks several times outside at the hotel too. Service is spotty but easy, nice place for a pre-meal glass of wine. Hotel staff is nice with good dinner recommendations. They also arranged a driver for us to Algarve region for the second half of our trip. We loved the driver, and I would highly recommend letting someone else drive you!"
Sep 2014,50,"Modern, Clean and Perfect Location",We stayed at the Santa Justa in August '14 and really enjoyed our stay.  The location was perfect and the room (with a balcony) was very modern and comfortable.  I definitely would recommend this property.
Sep 2014,40,"Really nice room, centrally located","We stayed at the Hotel Santa Justa for 2 nights, and we enjoyed our stay. The room was in great condition, free minibar, and a really nice bed.We didnt try the breakfast or the restaurant connected to the hotel, but the street on the entrance side is packed with restaurants that pop-up around mid-day. Can be a little bit annoying when leaving the hotel to go sightseeing, and you have to avoid 10-15 pushy hosts trying to get you to eat in their restaurant. We lived on the 2nd floor, facing the restaurant side, so we didnt really care to open our windows once, as we already knew that it would be too much noise during the night. The room had a bathtub with air-flow, which was a really nice combo with the free mini-bar :)The staff all spoke relatively good english, and was knowledgable about what to see and do.We payed 25 euro for taxi FROM the airport, and 10 euro TO the airport, so be aware!"
Sep 2014,50,"Perfect location, nice design, great breakfast","We stayed here for two nights on our honeymoon and liked it a lot. They welcomed us with a small bottle of port and those lovely little custard cakes, delicious. The room was rather small but very well designed, elegant, modern and with a cosy feel. It even had a little terrace with a view of the street. The bed was very comfy, the bathroom elegant and clean, separated by a glass wall from the room. The breakfast was excellent, lots of choices and it's served on the ground floor, so you look out onto the street. The hotel is really centrally located, it's the perfect base for exploring Lisbon by foot or by tram, metro etc. The only caveat is that taxis can't enter the street since it's a pedestrian zone, so you need to walk the last 50m by foot. We'd definitely stay here again!"
Sep 2014,50,Modern and clean with attentive staff,"Great hotel, the staff are very, very friendly and helpful. Room very clean and streamlined. Bathroom had lots of products in to use more than most.  Nothing too much trouble for the staff.  The Jacuzzi didn't work when we tried it and the next morning they had staff in to fix it for us and they were very discreet and apologetic.  On the first evening they knocked with a small bottle of port and mini pastel de nata cakes for us, which was a nice touch for guests.  They also left with the towels on the extra bed we had in the room for our child, toiletries and chocolates!  Only coffee making facilities in the room, but a pot of tea on a tray is only 2 euros to collect from the bar area on your way up to your room.  Would highly recommend!"
Sep 2014,40,Very nice hotel and centrally located,"We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is very nice and modern. Rooms were large and clean. Particularly nice was the welcome bottle of port and tarts on arrival. As well the free minibar was very much appreciated. It was stocked with water, coke, beer, etc. We didn't have breakfast here as it seemed expensive.The location is great because it's central but it's in a super touristy area and once you walk out the door you are bombarded constantly by aggressive restaurant hosts trying to get you into their restaurant. This got really annoying super fast as they just keep badgering you even if you say no. The drug pushers in the area actually weren't as bad because if you said no they wouldn't bother you anymore. The hotel was very nice but I would prefer to stay in nearby Chiado instead. We also stayed at the Internacional Design Hotel on our last night in Lisbon. Both hotels are very good with similar prices but we preferred the Design Hotel."
Sep 2014,50,Top 5 hotels that I've ever stayed at (which includes a St Regis Property),"The Santa Justa was wonderful. It's central location near Rossio Square enabled easy transit across Lisbos (eg, Belem and Cascais) and access to popular neighborhoods and great eateries. The hotel accomedations were modern and tremendously comfortable. In addition, we looked forward to the tasty breakfast they served in the lounge each morning. If I ever find myself in Lisbon again, I will definitely be staying at the Santa Justa!"
Sep 2014,50,"Great staff, great hotel!","Needless to say that the location of the hotel is perfect. You could not have it more central and close to all the attractions: yellow trams, castle, river, main street, metro/train, elevadors, pracas... Yet the most reassuring was the friendliness of the staff who was always on the lookout to help in all we asked for: room service, information, guidance. We had a room at the 5'th floor, asked in advance for it and got it :). The windows were sealing perfectly so the noise from the street was non existing. With a treat like this I'm sure we'll stay at this hotel next time. Lisboa was very charming so it needs to be explored again. Would have been good to stay more than 1 week... Thanks again!"
Sep 2014,50,"Great location, great hotel","This is a great location for the historic parts of Lisbon.  A short walk and you are at the waterside and beside the beautiful historic arch and statues.  Round the corner you can get on trams to visit Belem (I recommend this!), or up to the castle in a 1910 tram!  The hotel was really clean, modern and mega friendly.  Only one blip when we ordered cocktails from the bar and they didn't have the ingredients to make up our choice of cocktail!  We made do with alternatives!  Would go back if I visit Lisbon again."
Sep 2014,50,Location!,"Very sadly for us, the Santa Justa Elevator was closed during our visit - this was why we chose the hotel. However this didn't detract from our stay in Lisbon.The beds were exceptionally comfortable, the room was always well made up. The mini bar really is free, they put complimentary port and natas in the room on arrival and just as others have said, breakfast here is one of the best ever.Our room was on the first floor on a corner so has a double aspect ratio (room 109). I imagine the same rooms higher up have fabulous views so it's worth trying to book a corner room. Saying that, we enjoyed our first floor proximity to street level; the evenings are quite lively but not rowdy and the noise can be immediately shut out by closing the windows (good double glazing).Lastly the staff were very considerate, something we found in general in Lisbon.Parking is €29 per night in the nearby car park but it's well worth getting a car and doing the short drives to Sintra and other beaches to the west and south of Lisbon.Location - brilliant! Halfway between St George's Castle and Bairro Alto and a couple of minutes' walk to the riverside.I will stay there again when I return to Lisbon!"
Sep 2014,50,What a Treat,"We just spent a weekend at Santa Justa and booked it based on all the good comments below. We weren't dissapointed. I emailed Claudia on several occasions before we left S Africa and she was so helpful. On arrival we were greeted by both Claudia and Pedro who were brilliant our whole stay. We had a room on the 4th floor with a small balcony overlooking the street. The room was very nice and spacious. The bathroom and especially the shower was excellent. There is a FREE mini bar which they restock every day, that was such a nice perk. Yes, they only give you 2 coffee capsules and then you pay for anymore you may need, does seem strange but if you consider the mini bar it really isn't a problem. We also had a complimentary bottle of port and cakes put in our room. It is on quite a busy pedestrian street with lots of activity but once you closed the balcony door you couldn't hear a thing. We did get irritated by the peddlers on the street but as said below, just say no and they move on. This is normal in Lisbon. We actually ate dinner in the restaurant a couple of nights. The food was good only comment would be that the waiter staff need to be a little more efficient. They were all extremely pleasant but on a few occasions we asked for something more that once but we never got it. They seemed to forget as soon as they left the table. But lovely restaurant, linen tablecloths and eager staff. Will definitely stay there again and thank you to all the staff and GM for making this such a wonderful stay."
Sep 2014,50,A great hotel in a great location,"If you are visiting Lisbon I would recommend staying at the Hotel Santa Justa. The staff were very helpful, showed us the main sites to see on a map, check-in was speedy. Our room was very spacious and quiet. On arrival in our room as a small bottle of port, tarts & chocolates. The street outside of the hotel was for pedestrians only & had lots of restaurants all wanting you to eat at their place. Location of the hotel couldn't have been better as within walking distance of most of the main sites.  Next time we come back to Lisbon we will definitely consider this hotel."
Sep 2014,50,Absolutely Amazing!,My husband and I visited Lisbon for our first anniversary.  We had a very difficult time choosing between the Sofitel and Hotel Santa Justa.  We are both so glad that we chose the Santa Justa.  It's a wonderful hotel in the best part of town with fantastic service!  We relied on their concierge quite a bit and they never let us down!  Thank you for the great stay Hotel Santa Justa!
